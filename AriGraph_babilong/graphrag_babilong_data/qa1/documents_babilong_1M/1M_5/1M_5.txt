Nay, I am mad indeed, with thirst
   For all to me this night denied
   And drunk with longing, and accurst
   Beyond all chance of sleep or rest,
   With love, unslaked, unsatisfied,
   And dreams of beauty unpossessed.Hating the hour that brings you not,
   Mad at the space betwixt us twain,
   Sad for my empty arms, so hot
   And fevered, even the chilly stone
   Can scarcely cool their burning pain,--
   And oh, this sense of being alone!Take hence, O Night, your wasted hours,
   You bring me not my Life's Delight,
   My Star of Stars, my Flower of Flowers!You leave me loveless and forlorn,
   Pass on, most false and futile night,
   Pass on, and perish in the Dawn!Famine Song

   Death and Famine on every side
       And never a sign of rain,
   The bones of those who have starved and died
       Unburied upon the plain.What care have I that the bones bleach white?To-morrow they may be mine,
   But I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And drink your lips like wine!Cholera, Riot, and Sudden Death,
       And the brave red blood set free,
   The glazing eye and the failing breath,--
       But what are these things to me?Your breath is quick and your eyes are bright
       And your blood is red like wine,
   And I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And hold your lips with mine!I hear the sound of a thousand tears,
       Like softly pattering rain,
   I see the fever, folly, and fears
       Fulfilling man's tale of pain.But for the moment your star is bright,
       I revel beneath its shine,
   For I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And feel your lips on mine!And you need not deem me over cold,
       That I do not stop to think
   For all the pleasure this Life may hold
       Is on the Precipice brink.Thought could but lessen my soul's delight,
       And to-day she may not pine.For I shall lie in your arms to-night
       And close your lips with mine!I trust what sorrow the Fates may send
       I may carry quietly through,
   And pray for grace when I reach the end,
       To die as a man should do.To-day, at least, must be clear and bright,
       Without a sorrowful sign,
   Because I sleep in your arms to-night
       And feel your lips on mine!So on I work, in the blazing sun,
       To bury what dead we may,
   But glad, oh, glad, when the day is done
       And the night falls round us grey.Would those we covered away from sight
       Had a rest as sweet as mine!For I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And drink your lips like wine!The Window Overlooking the Harbour

   Sad is the Evening: all the level sand
     Lies left and lonely, while the restless sea,
   Tired of the green caresses of the land,
     Withdraws into its own infinity.But still more sad this white and chilly Dawn
     Filling the vacant spaces of the sky,
   While little winds blow here and there forlorn
     And all the stars, weary of shining, die.And more than desolate, to wake, to rise,
     Leaving the couch, where softly sleeping still,
   What through the past night made my heaven, lies;
     And looking out across the window sill

   See, from the upper window's vantage ground,
     Mankind slip into harness once again,
   And wearily resume his daily round
     Of love and labour, toil and strife and pain.How the sad thoughts slip back across the night:
     The whole thing seems so aimless and so vain.What use the raptures, passion and delight,
     Burnt out; as though they could not wake again.The worn-out nerves and weary brain repeat
     The question: Whither all these passions tend;--
   This curious thirst, so painful and so sweet,
     So fierce, so very short-lived, to what end?Even, if seeking for ourselves, the Race,
     The only immortality we know,--
   Even if from the flower of our embrace
     Some spark should kindle, or some fruit should grow,

   What were the use?the gain, to us or it,
     That we should cause another You or Me,--
   Another life, from our light passion lit,
     To suffer like ourselves awhile and die.Our being runs
     In a closed circle.All we know or see
   Tends to assure us that a thousand Suns,
     Teeming perchance with life, have ceased to be.Ah, the grey Dawn seems more than desolate,
     And the past night of passion worse than waste,
   Love but a useless flower, that soon or late,
     Turns to a fruit with bitter aftertaste.Youth, even Youth, seems futile and forlorn
     While the new day grows slowly white above.Pale and reproachful comes the chilly Dawn
     After the fervour of a night of love.Back to the Border

   The tremulous morning is breaking
     Against the white waste of the sky,
   And hundreds of birds are awaking
     In tamarisk bushes hard by.I, waiting alone in the station,
     Can hear in the distance, grey-blue,
   The sound of that iron desolation,
     The train that will bear me from you.'T will carry me under your casement,
     You'll feel in your dreams as you lie
   The quiver, from gable to basement,
     The rush of my train sweeping by.And I shall look out as I pass it,--
     Your dear, unforgettable door,
   'T was _ours_ till last night, but alas!it
     Will never be mine any more.Through twilight blue-grey and uncertain,
     Where frost leaves the window-pane free,
   I'll look at the tinsel-edged curtain
     That hid so much pleasure for me.I go to my long undone duty
     Alone in the chill and the gloom,
   My eyes are still full of the beauty
     I leave in your rose-scented room.Lie still in your dreams; for your tresses
     Are free of my lingering kiss.I keep you awake with caresses
     No longer; be happy in this!From passion you told me you hated
     You're now and for ever set free,
   I pass in my train, sorrow-weighted,
     Your house that was Heaven to me.You won't find a trace, when you waken,
     Of me or my love of the past,
   Rise up and rejoice!I have taken
     My longed-for departure at last.My fervent and useless persistence
     You never need suffer again,
   Nor even perceive in the distance
     The smoke of my vanishing train!Reverie: Zahir-u-Din

   Alone, I wait, till her twilight gate
                        The Night slips quietly through,
   With shadow and gloom, and purple bloom,
                        Flung over the Zenith blue.Her stars that tremble, would fain dissemble
                        Light over lovers thrown,--
   Her hush and mystery know no history
                        Such as day may own.Day has record of pleasure and pain,
   But things that are done by Night remain
                        For ever and ever unknown.For a thousand years, 'neath a thousand skies,
                        Night has brought men love;
   Therefore the old, old longings rise
                        As the light grows dim above.Therefore, now that the shadows close,
                        And the mists weird and white,
   While Time is scented with musk and rose;
                        Magic with silver light.I long for love; will you grant me some?as lovers have always come,
                        Through the evenings of the Past.Swiftly, as lovers have always come,
   Softly, as lovers have always come
                        Through the long-forgotten Past.Sea Song

   Against the planks of the cabin side,
       (So slight a thing between them and me,)
   The great waves thundered and throbbed and sighed,
       The great green waves of the Indian sea!Your face was white as the foam is white,
       Your hair was curled as the waves are curled,
   I would we had steamed and reached that night
       The sea's last edge, the end of the world.The wind blew in through the open port,
       So freshly joyous and salt and free,
   Your hair it lifted, your lips it sought,
       And then swept back to the open sea.The engines throbbed with their constant beat;
       Your heart was nearer, and all I heard;
   Your lips were salt, but I found them sweet,
       While, acquiescent, you spoke no word.So straight you lay in your narrow berth,
       Rocked by the waves; and you seemed to be
   Essence of all that is sweet on earth,
       Of all that is sad and strange at sea.And you were white as the foam is white,
       Your hair was curled as the waves are curled.had we but sailed and reached that night,
       The sea's last edge, the end of the world!'T is eight miles out and eight miles in,
        Just at the break of morn.'T is ice without and flame within,
        To gain a kiss at dawn!Far, where the Lilac Hills arise
        Soft from the misty plain,
   A lone enchanted hollow lies
        Where I at last drew rein.Midwinter grips this lonely land,
        This stony, treeless waste,
   Where East, due East, across the sand,
        We fly in fevered haste.the East will soon be red,
        The wild duck westward fly,
   And make above my anxious head,
        Triangles in the sky.Like wind we go; we both are still
        So young; all thanks to Fate!(It cuts like knives, this air so chill,)
        Dear God!Behind us, wrapped in mist and sleep
        The Ruined City lies,
   (Although we race, we seem to creep!)Eight miles out only, eight miles in,
        Good going all the way;
   But more and more the clouds begin
        To redden into day.And every snow-tipped peak grows pink
        An iridescent gem!My heart beats quick, with joy, to think
        How I am nearing them!As mile on mile behind us falls,
        Till, Oh, delight!I see
   My Heart's Desire, who softly calls
        Across the gloom to me.The utter joy of that First Love
        No later love has given,
   When, while the skies grew light above,
        We entered into Heaven.Till I Wake

   When I am dying, lean over me tenderly, softly,
     Stoop, as the yellow roses droop in the wind from the South.So I may, when I wake, if there be an Awakening,
     Keep, what lulled me to sleep, the touch of your lips on my mouth.His Rubies: Told by Valgovind

   Along the hot and endless road,
     Calm and erect, with haggard eyes,
   The prisoner bore his fetters' load
     Beneath the scorching, azure skies.Serene and tall, with brows unbent,
     Without a hope, without a friend,
   He, under escort, onward went,
     With death to meet him at the end.The Poppy fields were pink and gay
     On either side, and in the heat
   Their drowsy scent exhaled all day
     A dream-like fragrance almost sweet.And when the cool of evening fell
     And tender colours touched the sky,
   He still felt youth within him dwell
     And half forgot he had to die.Sometimes at night, the Camp-fires lit
     And casting fitful light around,
   His guard would, friend-like, let him sit
     And talk awhile with them, unbound.Thus they, the night before the last,
     Were resting, when a group of girls
   Across the small encampment passed,
     With laughing lips and scented curls.Then in the Prisoner's weary eyes
     A sudden light lit up once more,
   The women saw him with surprise,
     And pity for the chains he bore.For little women reck of Crime
     If young and fair the criminal be
   Here in this tropic, amorous clime
     Where love is still untamed and free.And one there was, she walked less fast,
     Behind the rest, perhaps beguiled
   By his lithe form, who, as she passed,
     Waited a little while, and smiled.The guard, in kindly Eastern fashion,
     Smiled to themselves, and let her stay.So tolerant of human passion,
     "To love he has but one more day."Yet when (the soft and scented gloom
     Scarce lighted by the dying fire)
   His arms caressed her youth and bloom,
     With him it was not all desire."For me," he whispered, as he lay,
     "But little life remains to live.One thing I crave to take away:
     You have the gift; but will you give?"If I could know some child of mine
     Would live his life, and see the sun
   Across these fields of poppies shine,
     What should I care that mine is done?"To die would not be dying quite,
     Leaving a little life behind,
   You, were you kind to me to-night,
     Could grant me this; but--are you kind?"See, I have something here for you
     For you and It, if It there be."Soft in the gloom her glances grew,
     With gentle tears he could not see.He took the chain from off his neck,
     Hid in the silver chain there lay
   Three rubies, without flaw or fleck.He drew her close; the moonless skies
     Shed little light; the fire was dead.Soft pity filled her youthful eyes,
     And many tender things she said.Throughout the hot and silent night
     All that he asked of her she gave.And, left alone ere morning light,
     He went serenely to the grave,

   Happy; for even when the rope
     Confined his neck, his thoughts were free,
   And centered round his Secret Hope
     The little life that was to be.When Poppies bloomed again, she bore
     His child who gaily laughed and crowed,
   While round his tiny neck he wore
     The rubies given on the road.For his small sake she wished to wait,
     But vainly to forget she tried,
   And grieving for the Prisoner's fate,
     She broke her gentle heart and died.Song of Taj Mahomed

   Dear is my inlaid sword; across the Border
   It brought me much reward; dear is my Mistress,
   The jewelled treasure of an amorous hour.Dear beyond measure are my dreams and Fancies.These I adore; for these I live and labour,
   Holding them more than sword or jewelled Mistress,
   For this indeed may rust, and that prove faithless,
   But, till my limbs are dust, I have my Fancies.The Garden of Kama:

   Kama the Indian Eros

   The daylight is dying,
   The Flying fox flying,
         Amber and amethyst burn in the sky.See, the sun throws a late,
   Lingering, roseate
         Kiss to the landscape to bid it good-bye.Oh, come, unresisting,
         Lovely, expectant, on tentative feet.Shadow shall cover us,
   Roses bend over us,
         Making a bride chamber, sacred and sweet.We know not life's reason,
   The length of its season,
         Know not if they know, the great Ones above.We none of us sought it,
   And few could support it,
         Were it not gilt with the glamour of love.But much is forgiven
   To Gods who have given,
         If but for an hour, the Rapture of Youth.You do not yet know it,
   But Kama shall show it,
         Changing your dreams to his Exquisite Truth.The Fireflies shall light you,
   And naught shall afright you,
         Nothing shall trouble the Flight of the Hours.Come, for I wait for you,
   Night is too late for you,
         Come, while the twilight is closing the flowers.Every breeze still is,
   And, scented with lilies,
         Cooled by the twilight, refreshed by the dew,
   The garden lies breathless,
   Where Kama, the Deathless,
         In the hushed starlight, is waiting for you.Camp Follower's Song, Gomal River

   We have left Gul Kach behind us,
      Are marching on Apozai,--
   Where pleasure and rest are waiting
      To welcome us by and by.We're falling back from the Gomal,
      Across the Gir-dao plain,
   The camping ground is deserted,
      We'll never come back again.Along the rocks and the defiles,
      The mules and the camels wind.Good-bye to Rahimut-Ullah,
      The man who is left behind.For some we lost in the skirmish,
      And some were killed in the fight,
   But he was captured by fever,
      In the sentry pit, at night.A rifle shot had been swifter,
      Less trouble a sabre thrust,
   But his Fate decided fever,
      And each man dies as he must.The wavering flames rise high,
   The flames of our burning grass-huts,
      Against the black of the sky.We hear the sound of the river,
      An ever-lessening moan,
   The hearts of us all turn backwards
      To where he is left alone.We sing up a little louder,
      We know that we feel bereft,
   We're leaving the camp together,
      And only one of us left.The only one, out of many,
      And each must come to his end,
   I wish I could stop this singing,
      He happened to be my friend.We're falling back from the Gomal
      We're marching on Apozai,
   And pleasure and rest are waiting
      To welcome us by and by.Perhaps the feast will taste bitter,
      The lips of the girls less kind,--
   Because of Rahimut-Ullah,
      The man who is left behind!Song of the Colours: by Taj Mahomed

   _Rose-colour_
   Rose Pink am I, the colour gleams and glows
     In many a flower; her lips, those tender doors
   By which, in time of love, love's essence flows
     From him to her, are dyed in delicate Rose.Mine is the earliest Ruby light that pours
     Out of the East, when day's white gates unclose.On downy peach, and maiden's downier cheek
     I, in a flush of radiant bloom, alight,
   Clinging, at sunset, to the shimmering peak
     I veil its snow in floods of Roseate light._Azure_
   Mine is the heavenly hue of Azure skies,
     Where the white clouds lie soft as seraphs' wings,
   Mine the sweet, shadowed light in innocent eyes,
     Whose lovely looks light only on lovely things.Mine the Blue Distance, delicate and clear,
     Mine the Blue Glory of the morning sea,
   All that the soul so longs for, finds not here,
     Fond eyes deceive themselves, and find in me.to the Royal Red of living Blood,
     Let loose by steel in spirit-freeing flood,
   Forced from faint forms, by toil or torture torn
     Staining the patient gates of life new born.Colour of War and Rage, of Pomp and Show,
     Banners that flash, red flags that flaunt and glow,
   Colour of Carnage, Glory, also Shame,
     Raiment of women women may not name.I hide in mines, where unborn Rubies dwell,
     Flicker and flare in fitful fire in Hell,
   The outpressed life-blood of the grape is mine,
     Hail!Strong am I, over strong, to eyes that tire,
     In the hot hue of Rapine, Riot, Flame.Death and Despair are black, War and Desire,
     The two red cards in Life's unequal game._Green_
   I am the Life of Forests, and Wandering Streams,
     Green as the feathery reeds the Florican love,
   Young as a maiden, who of her marriage dreams,
     Still sweetly inexperienced in ways of Love.Colour of Youth and Hope, some waves are mine,
     Some emerald reaches of the evening sky.See, in the Spring, my sweet green Promise shine,
     Never to be fulfilled, of by and by.Never to be fulfilled; leaves bud, and ever
     Something is wanting, something falls behind;
   The flowered Solstice comes indeed, but never
     That light and lovely summer men divined._Violet_
   I were the colour of Things, (if hue they had)
         That are hard to name.Of curious, twisted thoughts that men call "mad"
         Or oftener "shame."Of that delicate vice, that is hardly vice,
         So reticent, rare,
   Ethereal, as the scent of buds and spice,
         In this Eastern air.On palm-fringed shores I colour the Cowrie shell,
         With its edges curled;
   And, deep in Datura poison buds, I dwell
         In a perfumed world.My lilac tinges the edge of the evening sky
         Where the sunset clings.My purple lends an Imperial Majesty
         To the robes of kings._Yellow_
   Gold am I, and for me, ever men curse and pray,
     Selling their souls and each other, by night and day.A sordid colour, and yet, I make some things fair,
     Dying sunsets, fields of corn, and a maiden's hair.Thus they discoursed in the daytime,--Violet, Yellow, and Blue,
     Emerald, Scarlet, and Rose-colour, the pink and perfect hue.Thus they spoke in the sunshine, when their beauty was manifest,
     Till the Night came, and the Silence, and gave them an equal rest.Lalila, to the Ferengi Lover

   Why above others was I so blessed
      And honoured?to be chosen one
   To hold you, sleeping, against my breast,
      As now I may hold your only son.You gave your life to me in a kiss;
   Have I done well, for that past delight,
      In return, to have given you this?Look down at his face, your face, beloved,
      His eyes are azure as yours are blue.In every line of his form is proved
      How well I loved you, and only you.I felt the secret hope at my heart
      Turned suddenly to the living joy,
   And knew that your life and mine had part
      As golden grains in a brass alloy.And learning thus, that your child was mine,
      Thrilled by the sense of its stirring life,
   I held myself as a sacred shrine
      Afar from pleasure, and pain, and strife,

   That all unworthy I might not be
      Of that you had deigned to cause to dwell
   Hidden away in the heart of me,
      As white pearls hide in a dusky shell.Do you remember, when first you laid
      Your lips on mine, that enchanted night?My eyes were timid, my lips afraid,
      You seemed so slender and strangely white.I always tremble; the moments flew
      Swiftly to dawn that took you away,
   But this is a small and lovely you
      Content to rest in my arms all day.Oh, since you have sought me, Lord, for this,
      And given your only child to me,
   My life devoted to yours and his,
      Whilst I am living, will always be.And after death, through the long To Be,
      (Which, I think, must surely keep love's laws,)
   I, should you chance to have need of me,
      Am ever and always, only yours.On the City Wall

   Upon the City Ramparts, lit up by sunset gleam,
   The Blue eyes that conquer, meet the Darker eyes that dream.The Dark eyes, so Eastern, and the Blue eyes from the West,
   The last alight with action, the first so full of rest.Brown, that seem to hold the Past; its magic mystery,
   Blue, that catch the early light, of ages yet to be.Meet and fall and meet again, then linger, look, and smile,
   Time and distance all forgotten, for a little while.Happy on the city wall, in the warm spring weather,
   All the force of Nature's laws, drawing them together.East and West so gaily blending, for a little space,
   All the sunshine seems to centre, round th' Enchanted place!One rides down the dusty road, one watches from the wall,
   Azure eyes would fain return, and Amber eyes recall;

   Would fain be on the ramparts, and resting heart to heart,
   But time o' love is overpast, East and West must part.Those are dim, and ride away, these cry themselves to sleep._"Oh, since Love is all so short, the sob so near the smile,_
   _Blue eyes that always conquer us, is it worth your while?"_





"Love Lightly"

   There were Roses in the hedges, and Sunshine in the sky,
   Red Lilies in the sedges, where the water rippled by,
   A thousand Bulbuls singing, oh, how jubilant they were,
   And a thousand flowers flinging their sweetness on the air.But you, who sat beside me, had a shadow in your eyes,
   Their sadness seemed to chide me, when I gave you scant replies;
   You asked "Did I remember?"In vain you fanned the ember, for the love flame was not there."And so, since you are tired of me, you ask me to forget,
     What is the use of caring, now that you no longer care?When Love is dead his Memory can only bring regret,
     But how can I forget you with the flowers in your hair?"What use the scented Roses, or the azure of the sky?They are sweet when Love reposes, but then he had to die.What could I do in leaving you, but ask you to forget,--
   I suffered, too, in grieving you; I all but loved you yet.But half love is a treason, that no lover can forgive,
   I had loved you for a season, I had no more to give.You saw my passion faltered, for I could but let you see,
   And it was not I that altered, but Fate that altered me.And so, since I am tired of love, I ask you to forget,
     What is the use you caring, now that I no longer care?When Love is dead, his Memory can only bring regret;
     Forget me, oh, forget me, and my flower-scented hair!No Rival Like the Past

   As those who eat a Luscious Fruit, sunbaked,
     Full of sweet juice, with zest, until they find
   It finished, and their appetite unslaked,
     And so return and eat the pared-off rind;--

   We, who in Youth, set white and careless teeth
     In the Ripe Fruits of Pleasure while they last,
   Later, creep back to gnaw the cast-off sheath,
     And find there is no Rival like the Past.Verse by Taj Mahomed

   When first I loved, I gave my very soul
   Utterly unreserved to Love's control,
   But Love deceived me, wrenched my youth away
   And made the gold of life for ever grey.Long I lived lonely, yet I tried in vain
   With any other Joy to stifle pain;
   There _is_ no other joy, I learned to know,
   And so returned to Love, as long ago.Yet I, this little while ere I go hence,
   Love very lightly now, in self-defence.Lines by Taj Mahomed

   This passion is but an ember
     Of a Sun, of a Fire, long set;
   I could not live and remember,
     And so I love and forget.You say, and the tone is fretful,
     That my mourning days were few,
   You call me over forgetful--
     My God, if you only knew!There is no Breeze to Cool the Heat of Love

   The listless Palm-trees catch the breeze above
     The pile-built huts that edge the salt Lagoon,
   There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love,
     No wind from land or sea, at night or noon.Perfumed and robed I wait, my Lord, for you,
     And my heart waits alert, with strained delight,
   My flowers are loath to close, as though they knew
     That you will come to me before the night.In the Verandah all the lights are lit,
     And softly veiled in rose to please your eyes,
   Between the pillars flying foxes flit,
     Their wings transparent on the lilac skies.Come soon, my Lord, come soon, I almost fear
     My heart may fail me in this keen suspense,
   Break with delight, at last, to know you near.Pleasure is one with Pain, if too intense.I envy these: the steps that you will tread,
     The jasmin that will touch you by its leaves,
   When, in your slender height, you stoop your head
     At the low door beneath the palm-thatched eaves.For though you utterly belong to me,
     And love has done his utmost 'twixt us twain,
   Your slightest, careless touch yet seems to be
     That keen delight so much akin to pain.The night breeze blows across the still Lagoon,
     And stirs the Palm-trees till they wave above
   Our pile-built huts; Oh, come, my Lord, come soon,
     There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love.Every time you give yourself to me,
     The gift seems greater, and yourself more fair,
   This slight-built, palm-thatched hut has come to be
     A temple, since, my Lord, you visit there.And as the water, gurgling softly, goes
     Among the piles beneath the slender floor;
   I hear it murmur, as it seaward flows,
     Of the great Wonder seen upon the shore.The Miracle, that you should come to me,
     Whom the whole world, seeing, can but desire,
   It is as though some White Star stooped to be
     The messmate of our little cooking fire.Leaving the Glory of his Purple Skies,
     And the White Friendship of the Crescent Moon,
   And yet;--I look into your brilliant eyes,
     And find content; Oh, come, my Lord, come soon.Perfumed and robed I wait for you, I wait,
     The flowers that please you wreathed about my hair,
   And this poor face set forth in jewelled state,
     So more than proud since you have found it fair.My lute is ready, and the fragrant drink
     Your lips may honour, how it will rejoice
   Losing its life in yours!the lute I think
     But wastes the time when I might hear your voice.Your slightest, as your utmost, wish or will,
   Whether it please you to caress or slay,
     It would please me to give obedience still.I would delight to die beneath your kiss;
     I envy that young maiden who was slain,
   So her warm blood, flowing beneath the kiss,
     Might ease the wounded Sultan of his pain--

   If she loved him as I love you, my Lord.There is no pleasure on the earth so sweet
   As is the pain endured for one adored;
     If I lay crushed beneath your slender feet

   I should be happy!Ah, come soon, come soon,
     See how the stars grow large and white above,
   The land breeze blows across the salt Lagoon,
     There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love.Malay Song

   The Stars await, serene and white,
     The unarisen moon;
   Oh, come and stay with me to-night,
     Beside the salt Lagoon!My hut is small, but as you lie,
     You see the lighted shore,
   And hear the rippling water sigh
     Beneath the pile-raised floor.No gift have I of jewels or flowers,
     My room is poor and bare:
   But all the silver sea is ours,
     And all the scented air

   Blown from the mainland, where there grows
     Th' "Intriguer of the Night,"
   The flower that you have named Tube rose,
     Sweet scented, slim, and white.The flower that, when the air is still
     And no land breezes blow,
   From its pale petals can distil
     A phosphorescent glow.I see your ship at anchor ride;
     Her "captive lightning" shine.Before she takes to-morrow's tide,
     Let this one night be mine!Though in the language of your land
     My words are poor and few,
   Oh, read my eyes, and understand,
     I give my youth to you!The Temple Dancing Girl

   You will be mine; those lightly dancing feet,
     Falling as softly on the careless street
   As the wind-loosened petals of a flower,
     Will bring you here, at the Appointed Hour.And all the Temple's little links and laws
     Will not for long protect your loveliness.I have a stronger force to aid my cause,
     Nature's great Law, to love and to possess!Throughout those sleepless watches, when I lay
     Wakeful, desiring what I might not see,
   I knew (it helped those hours, from dusk to day),
     In this one thing, Fate would be kind to me.You will consent, through all my veins like wine
     This prescience flows; your lips meet mine above,
   Your clear soft eyes look upward into mine
     Dim in a silent ecstasy of love.The clustered softness of your waving hair,
     That curious paleness which enchants me so,
   And all your delicate strength and youthful air,
     Destiny will compel you to bestow!Refuse, withdraw, and hesitate awhile,
     Your young reluctance does but fan the flame;
   My partner, Love, waits, with a tender smile,
     Who play against him play a losing game.I, strong in nothing else, have strength in this,
     The subtlest, most resistless, force we know
   Is aiding me; and you must stoop and kiss:
     The genius of the race will have it so!Yet, make it not too long, nor too intense
     My thirst; lest I should break beneath the strain,
   And the worn nerves, and over-wearied sense,
     Enjoy not what they spent themselves to gain.Lest, in the hour when you consent to share
     That human passion Beauty makes divine,
   I, over worn, should find you over fair,
     Lest I should die before I make you mine.You will consent, those slim, reluctant feet,
     Falling as lightly on the careless street
   As the white petals of a wind-worn flower,
     Will bring you here, at the Appointed Hour.Hira-Singh's Farewell to Burmah

   On the wooden deck of the wooden Junk, silent, alone, we lie,
   With silver foam about the bow, and a silver moon in the sky:
   A glimmer of dimmer silver here, from the anklets round your feet,
   Our lips may close on each other's lips, but never our souls may meet.For though in my arms you lie at rest, your name I have never heard,
   To carry a thought between us two, we have not a single word.And yet what matter we do not speak, when the ardent eyes have spoken,
   The way of love is a sweeter way, when the silence is unbroken.As a wayward Fancy, tired at times, of the cultured Damask Rose,
   Drifts away to the tangled copse, where the wild Anemone grows;
   So the ordered and licit love ashore, is hardly fresh and free
   As this light love in the open wind and salt of the outer sea.So sweet you are, with your tinted cheeks and your small caressive hands,
   What if I carried you home with me, where our Golden Temple stands?Yet, this were folly indeed; to bind, in fetters of permanence,
   A passing dream whose enchantment charms because of its trancience.Life is ever a slave to Time; we have but an hour to rest,
   Her steam is up and her lighters leave, the vessel that takes me west;
   And never again we two shall meet, as we chance to meet to-night,
   On the Junk, whose painted eyes gaze forth, in desolate want of sight.And what is love at its best, but this?Conceived by a passing glance,
   Nursed and reared in a transient mood, on a drifting Sea of Chance.For rudderless craft are all our loves, among the rocks and the shoals,
   Well we may know one another's speech, but never each other's souls.Give here your lips and kiss me again, we have but a moment more,
   Before we set the sail to the mast, before we loosen the oar.Good-bye to you, and my thanks to you, for the rest you let me share,
   While this night drifted away to the Past, to join the Nights that Were.Starlight

   O beautiful Stars, when you see me go
     Hither and thither, in search of love,
   Do you think me faithless, who gleam and glow
     Serene and fixed in the blue above?O Stars, so golden, it is not so.But there is a garden I dare not see,
     There is a place where I fear to go,
   Since the charm and glory of life to me
     The brown earth covered there, long ago.O Stars, you saw it, you know, you know.Hither and thither I wandering go,
     With aimless haste and wearying fret;
   In a search for pleasure and love?Not so,
     Seeking desperately to forget.You see so many, O Stars, you know.Sampan Song

   A little breeze blew over the sea,
       And it came from far away,
   Across the fields of millet and rice,
   All warm with sunshine and sweet with spice,
   It lifted his curls and kissed him thrice,
       As upon the deck he lay.It said, "Oh, idle upon the sea,
       Awake and with sleep have done,
   Haul up the widest sail of the prow,
   And come with me to the rice fields now,
   She longs, oh, how can I tell you how,
       To show you your first-born son!"Song of the Devoted Slave

   There is one God: Mahomed his Prophet.Had I his power
   I would take the topmost peaks of the snow-clad Himalayas,
   And would range them around your dwelling, during the heats of summer,
   To cool the airs that fan your serene and delicate presence,
                   Had I the power.Your courtyard should ever be filled with the fleetest of camels
   Laden with inlaid armour, jewels and trappings for horses,
   Ripe dates from Egypt, and spices and musk from Arabia.And the sacred waters of Zem-Zem well, transported thither,
   Should bubble and flow in your chamber, to bathe the delicate
   Slender and wayworn feet of my Lord, returning from travel,
                   Had I the power.Fine woven silk, from the further East, should conceal your beauty,
   Clinging around you in amorous folds; caressive, silken,
   Beautiful long-lashed, sweet-voiced Persian boys should, kneeling, serve you,
   And the floor beneath your sandalled feet should be smooth and golden,
                   Had I the power.And if ever your clear and stately thoughts should turn to women,
   Kings' daughters, maidens, should be appointed to your caresses,
   That the youth and the strength of my Lord might never be wasted
   In light or sterile love; but enrich the world with his children.Whilst I should sit in the outer court of the Water Palace
   To await the time when you went forth, for Pleasure or Warfare,
   Descending the stairs rose crowned, or armed and arrayed in purple,--
   To mark the place where your steps have fallen, and kiss the footprints,
                   Had I the power.The Singer

   The singer only sang the Joy of Life,
     For all too well, alas!the singer knew
   How hard the daily toil, how keen the strife,
     How salt the falling tear; the joys how few.He who thinks hard soon finds it hard to live,
     Learning the Secret Bitterness of Things:
   So, leaving thought, the singer strove to give
     A level lightness to his lyric strings.He only sang of Love; its joy and pain,
     But each man in his early season loves;
   Each finds the old, lost Paradise again,
     Unfolding leaves, and roses, nesting doves.And though that sunlit time flies all too fleetly,
     Delightful Days that dance away too soon!Its early morning freshness lingers sweetly
     Throughout life's grey and tedious afternoon.And he, whose dreams enshrine her tender eyes,
     And she, whose senses wait his waking hand,
   Impatient youth, that tired but sleepless lies,
     Will read perhaps, and reading, understand.Oh, roseate lips he would have loved to kiss,
     Oh, eager lovers that he never knew!What should you know of him, or words of his?--
     But all the songs he sang were sung for you!Malaria

   He lurks among the reeds, beside the marsh,
     Red oleanders twisted in His hair,
   His eyes are haggard and His lips are harsh,
     Upon His breast the bones show gaunt and bare.The green and stagnant waters lick His feet,
     And from their filmy, iridescent scum
   Clouds of mosquitoes, gauzy in the heat,
     Rise with His gifts: Death and Delirium.His messengers: They bear the deadly taint
     On spangled wings aloft and far away,
   Making thin music, strident and yet faint,
     From golden eve to silver break of day.The baffled sleeper hears th' incessant whine
     Through his tormented dreams, and finds no rest
   The thirsty insects use his blood for wine,
     Probe his blue veins and pasture on his breast.While far away He in the marshes lies,
     Staining the stagnant water with His breath,
   An endless hunger burning in His eyes,
     A famine unassuaged, whose food is Death.He hides among the ghostly mists that float
     Over the water, weird and white and chill,
   And peasants, passing in their laden boat,
     Shiver and feel a sense of coming ill.A thousand burn and die; He takes no heed,
     Their bones, unburied, strewn upon the plain,
   Only increase the frenzy of His greed
     To add more victims to th' already slain.He loves the haggard frame, the shattered mind,
     Gloats with delight upon the glazing eye,
   Yet, in one thing, His cruelty is kind,
     He sends them lovely dreams before they die;

   Dreams that bestow on them their heart's desire,
     Visions that find them mad, and leave them blest,
   To sink, forgetful of the fever's fire,
     Softly, as in a lover's arms, to rest.Fancy

   Far in the Further East the skilful craftsman
       Fashioned this fancy for the West's delight.This rose and azure Dragon, crouching softly
       Upon the satin skin, close-grained and white.And you lay silent, while his slender needles
       Pricked the intricate pattern on your arm,
   Combining deftly Cruelty and Beauty,
       That subtle union, whose child is charm.Charm irresistible: the lovely something
       We follow in our dreams, but may not reach.The unattainable Divine Enchantment,
       Hinted in music, never heard in speech.This from the blue design exhales towards me,
       As incense rises from the Homes of Prayer,
   While the unfettered eyes, allured and rested,
       Urge the forbidden lips to stoop and share;

   Share in the sweetness of the rose and azure
       Traced in the Dragon's form upon the white
   Curve of the arm.Ah, curb thyself, my fancy,
       Where would'st thou drift in this enchanted flight?Feroza

   The evening sky was as green as Jade,
      As Emerald turf by Lotus lake,
   Behind the Kafila far she strayed,
      (The Pearls are lost if the Necklace break!)A lingering freshness touched the air
      From palm-trees, clustered around a Spring,
   The great, grim Desert lay vast and bare,
      But Youth is ever a careless thing.The Raiders threw her upon the sand,
      Men of the Wilderness know no laws,
   They tore the Amethysts off her hand,
      And rent the folds of her veiling gauze.They struck the lips that they might have kissed,
      Pitiless they to her pain and fear,
   And wrenched the gold from her broken wrist,
      No use to cry; there were none to hear.Her scarlet mouth and her onyx eyes,
      Her braided hair in its silken sheen,
   Were surely meet for a Lover's prize,
      But Fate dissented, and stepped between.Across the Zenith the vultures fly,
      Cruel of beak and heavy of wing.This Month the Almonds Bloom at Kandahar

   I hate this City, seated on the Plain,
     The clang and clamour of the hot Bazar,
   Knowing, amid the pauses of my pain,
     This month the Almonds bloom in Kandahar.The Almond-trees, that sheltered my Delight,
     Screening my happiness as evening fell.It was well worth--that most Enchanted Night--
     This life in torment, and the next in Hell!People are kind to me; one More than Kind,
     Her lashes lie like fans upon her cheek,
   But kindness is a burden on my mind,
     And it is weariness to hear her speak.For though that Kaffir's bullet holds me here,
     My thoughts are ever free, and wander far,
   To where the Lilac Hills rise, soft and clear,
     Beyond the Almond Groves of Kandahar.He followed me to Sibi, to the Fair,
     The Horse-fair, where he shot me weeks ago,
   But since they fettered him I have no care
     That my returning steps to health are slow.They will not loose him till they know my fate,
     And I rest here till I am strong to slay,
   Meantime, my Heart's Delight may safely wait
     Among the Almond blossoms, sweet as they.Well, he won by day,
     But I won, what I so desired, by night,
   _My_ arms held what his lack till Judgment Day!Also, the game is not yet over--quite!Wait, Amir Ali, wait till I come forth
     To kill, before the Almond-trees are green,
   To raze thy very Memory from the North,
     _So that thou art not, and thou hast not been!_

   Aha!it is Duty
     To rid the World from Shiah dogs like thee,
   They are but ill-placed moles on Islam's beauty,
     Such as the Faithful cannot calmly see!Also thy bullet hurts me not a little,
     Thy Shiah blood might serve to salve the ill.Maybe some Afghan Promises are brittle;
     Never a Promise to oneself, to kill!Now I grow stronger, I have days of leisure
     To shape my coming Vengeance as I lie,
   And, undisturbed by call of War or Pleasure,
     Can dream of many ways a man may die.I shall not torture thee, thy friends might rally,
     Some Fate assist thee and prove false to me;
   Oh!shouldst thou now escape me, Amir Ali,
     This would torment me through Eternity!Aye, Shuffa-Jan, I will be quiet indeed,
     Give here the Hakim's powder if thou wilt,
   And thou mayst sit, for I perceive thy need,
     And rest thy soft-haired head upon my quilt.Thy gentle love will not disturb a mind
     That loves and hates beneath a fiercer Star.Also, thou know'st, my Heart is left behind,
     Among the Almond-trees of Kandahar!End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of India's Love Lyrics, by 
Adela Florence Cory Nicolson (AKA Laurence Hope), et al.When I try to picture them to myself, I see only the lights,
projectors, automobiles--those terrible guns--and something
walking, walking.And those vulgar mustaches of Wilhelm--but
that is a mask, an immobile mask, which has stood over Europe
for a quarter of a century--what is behind it?Those vulgar
mustaches--and suddenly so much misery, so much bloodshed and
destruction!PIERRE

_Almost to himself._

If there were only not so many of them, not so many--.Father, I
believe that Maurice will live.But what does
mamma think about it?EMIL GRELIEU

What mamma thinks?Sternly, without looking at anyone, he waters
the flowers._

And what does he think?PIERRE

He can hardly hear anything.EMIL GRELIEU

I don't know whether he hears anything or not.But there was a
time when he did hear.He is silent, Pierre, and he furiously
denies war.He denies it by work--he works alone in the garden
as if nothing had happened.Mamma and everyone else in the house are busy, feeding them,
washing the children--mamma is washing them--but he does not
seem to notice anything.Now he is bursting from
anxiety to hear or guess what we are saying, but do you see the
expression of his face?If you start to talk to him he will go
away.EMIL GRELIEU

Don't bother him.You see that she is not here, and yet these are your last hours
at home.Yes, in this house--I am speaking of the house.She
is young and resolute as ever, she walks just as lightly and is
just as clear-headed, but she is not here.PIERRE

Is she concealing something?EMIL GRELIEU

No, she is not concealing anything, but she has gone into the
depths of her own self, where all is silence and mystery.She is
living through her motherhood again, from the very beginning--do
you understand?when you and Maurice were not yet born--but
in this she is crafty, like François.Sometimes I see clearly
that she is suffering unbearably, that she is terrified by the
war--.But she smiles in answer and then I see something else--I
see how there has suddenly awakened in her the prehistoric
woman--the woman who handed her husband the fighting club--._Military music is heard in the distance, nearing._

PIERRE

Yes, according to the assignment, it is the Ninth Regiment.EMIL GRELIEU

Let us hear it, Pierre.There it starts on the right, and there it dies down._They listen._

But they are brave fellows!François looks at them
askance and tries in vain to hear.The music begins to die out._

EMIL GRELIEU

_Walking away from the window._

Yesterday they played the "Marseillaise."_Emil Grelieu's wife enters quickly._

JEANNE

Do you hear it?Even our refugees smiled when
they heard it.Emil, I have brought you some telegrams, here.EMIL GRELIEU

What is it?_Reading the telegrams, he staggers to an armchair and sinks
into it.He turns pale._

PIERRE

What is it, father?EMIL GRELIEU

Read!_Pierre reads it over the shoulder of his father.The woman
looks at them with an enigmatical expression upon her face.She sits calmly, her beautiful head thrown back.Emil Grelieu
rises quickly, and both he and his son start to pace the room in
opposite directions._

PIERRE

Do you see?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes!JEANNE

_As though indifferently._

Emil, was that an interesting library which they have destroyed?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, very.JEANNE

Oh, I speak only of those books!Tell me, were there many books
there?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, many, many!JEANNE

And they've burned them?_She hums softly in afresh, strong voice._

"Only the halo of the arts crowns law, liberty, and the
King!--Law--"

EMIL GRELIEU

Books, books.JEANNE

And there was also a Cathedral there.Isn't
it true, Emil, that it was a beautiful structure?_Hums._

"Law, liberty, and the King--"

PIERRE

Father!EMIL GRELIEU

_He walks up and down the room._

JEANNE

Pierre, it will soon be time for you to leave.I'll give you
something to eat at once.Pierre, do you think it is true that
they are killing women and children?PIERRE

It is true, mother.EMIL GRELIEU

How can you say it, Jeanne?JEANNE

I say this on account of the children.Yes, there they write
that they are killing children, so they write there.And
all this was crowded upon that little slip of paper--and the
children, as well as the fire--

_Rises quickly and walks away, humming._

EMIL GRELIEU

Where are you going, Jeanne?JEANNE

Nowhere in particular._Without turning around, François walks out, his shoulders bent.Jeanne goes to the other door with a strange
half-smile._

PIERRE

Mamma!JEANNE

I will return directly.EMIL GRELIEU

What shall I call them?My dear Pierre, my
boy, what shall I call them?PIERRE

You are greatly agitated, father.EMIL GRELIEU

I have always thought, I have always been convinced that words
were at my command, but here I stand before this monstrous,
inexplicable--I don't know, I don't know what to call them.My
heart is crying out, I hear its voice, but the word!Pierre,
you are a student, you are young, your words are direct and
pure--Pierre, find the word!PIERRE

You want me to find it, father?Yes, I was a student, and I knew
certain words: Peace, Right, Humanity.My heart
is crying too, but I do not know what to call these scoundrels.EMIL GRELIEU

That is not strong enough.Pierre, I have decided--

PIERRE

Decided?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, I am going.EMIL GRELIEU

I decided to do it several days ago--even then, at the very
beginning.And I really don't know why I--.Oh, yes, I had to
overcome within me--my love for flowers._Ironically._

Yes, Pierre, my love for flowers.Oh, my boy, it is so hard to
change from flowers to iron and blood!PIERRE

Father, I dare not contradict you.EMIL GRELIEU

No, no, you dare not.Listen, Pierre, you
must examine me as a physician.PIERRE

I am only a student, father.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, but you know enough to say--.You see, Pierre, I must
not burden our little army with a single superfluous sick or
weak man.I must bring with me strength and
power, not shattered health.And I am asking
you, Pierre, to examine me, simply as a physician, as a young
physician.Must I
take this off, or can you do it without removing this?PIERRE

It can be done this way.EMIL GRELIEU

I think so, too.And--must I tell you everything, or--?At any
rate, I will tell you that I have not had any serious ailments,
and for my years I am a rather strong, healthy man.You know
what a life I am leading.PIERRE

That is unnecessary, father.EMIL GRELIEU

It is necessary.I want to say that in my
life there were none of those unwholesome--and bad excesses.Oh,
the devil take it, how hard it is to speak of it.PIERRE

Papa, I know all this.Silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

But it is necessary to take my pulse, Pierre, I beg of you.PIERRE

_Smiling faintly._

It isn't necessary to do even that.As a physician, I can tell
you that you are healthy, but--you are unfit for war, you are
unfit for war, father!I am listening to you and I feel like
crying, father.EMIL GRELIEU

_Thoughtfully._

Yes, yes.Do you think,
Pierre, that I should not kill?Pierre, you think, that I, Emil
Grelieu, must not kill under any circumstances and at any time?PIERRE

_Softly._

I dare not touch upon your conscience, father.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, that is a terrible question for a man.Of course, I could take your gun, but not to fire--no,
that would have been disgusting, a sacrilegious deception!When
my humble people are condemned to kill, who am I that I should
keep my hands clean?That would be disgusting cleanliness,
obnoxious saintliness.My humble nation did not desire to kill,
but it was forced, and it has become a murderer.So I, too, must
become a murderer, together with my nation.Upon whose shoulders
will I place the sin--upon the shoulders of our youths and
children?And if ever the Higher Conscience of the
world will call my dear people to the terrible accounting, if
it will call you and Maurice, my children, and will say to you:
"What have you done?I will come forward and
will say: "First you must judge me; I have also murdered--and
you know that I am an honest man!"_Pierre sits motionless, his face covered with his hands.Enter
Jeanne, unnoticed._

PIERRE

_Uncovering his face._

But you must not die!EMIL GRELIEU

_Loudly, and with contempt._

Oh, death!Jeanne sits down and
speaks in the same tone of strange, almost cheerful calm._

JEANNE

Emil, she is here again.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes?JEANNE

She does not know herself.Emil, her dress and her hands were in
blood.EMIL GRELIEU

She is wounded?JEANNE

No, it is not her own blood, and by the color I could not tell
whose blood it is.PIERRE

Who is that, mother?I have combed her hair and
put a clean dress on her.Emil, I have
heard something--I understand that you want to go--?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.JEANNE

Together with your children, Emil?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.Pierre has examined me and finds that I am fit to enter the
ranks.JEANNE

You intend to go tomorrow?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.JEANNE

You cannot manage it today.Pierre, you have only an hour and a
half left._Silence._

PIERRE

Mamma!Tell him that he must not--Forgive me, father!--that he
should not go.He has given
to the nation his two sons--what more should he give?JEANNE

More, Pierre?PIERRE

Yes,--his life.You love him; you, yourself, would die if he
were killed--tell him that, mother!JEANNE

Yes, I love him.PIERRE

Oh, what are we, Maurice and I?Just as they have no
right to destroy temples in war or to bum libraries, just as
they have no right to touch the eternal, so he--he--has no right
to die.I am speaking not as your son, no; but to kill Emil
Grelieu--that would be worse than to bum books.Listen to me!--although I
am young and should be silent--Listen to me!They have deprived us of our land and of the air;
they have destroyed our treasures which have been created
by the genius of our people, and now we would cast our best
men into their jaws!Let them kill us all, let our land be turned into a waste
desert, let all living creatures be burned to death, but as long
as he lives, Belgium is alive!Oh,
do not be silent, mother!_Silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

_Somewhat sternly._

Calm yourself, Pierre!JEANNE

Yesterday I--no, Pierre, that isn't what I was going to say--I
don't know anything about it.But yesterday
I--it is hard to get vegetables, and even bread, here--so I went
to town, and for some reason we did not go in that direction,
but nearer the field of battle--.How strange it is that we
found ourselves there!And there I saw them coming--

EMIL GRELIEU

Whom?They were coming from there--where the battle
raged for four days.There were not many of them--about a
hundred or two hundred.But we all--there were so many people in
the streets--we all stepped back to the wall in order to make
way for them.Emil, just think of it; how strange!They did not
see us, and we would have been in their way!They were black
from smoke, from mud, from dried blood, and they were swaying
from fatigue.But that is
nothing, that is all nothing.They did not see their surroundings, they still reflected that
which they had seen there--fire and smoke and death--and what
else?Some one said: "Here are people returning from hell."We
all bowed to them, we bowed to them, but they did not see that
either.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, Jeanne, that is possible.PIERRE

And he will go to that inferno?Emil Grelieu walks over to his wife and kisses her
hand.Suddenly she rises._

JEANNE

Forgive me; there is something else I must say--

_She moves quickly and lightly, but suddenly, as though
stumbling over an invisible obstacle, falls on one knee.Then
she tries to rise, kneels, pale and still smiling, bending to
one side.They rush over to her and lift her from the ground._

PIERRE

Mamma!EMIL GRELIEU

You have a headache?Jeanne, my dearest, what ails you?_She pushes them aside, stands up firmly, trying to conceal her
nervousness._

JEANNE

What is it?My foot
slipped--you know, the one that pained me.EMIL GRELIEU

A glass of water, Pierre.Jeanne sits down, hangs her
head, as one guilty, endeavoring not to look into his eyes._

JEANNE

What an excitable youth--your Pierre!EMIL GRELIEU

_Significantly._

Jeanne!No, no--why do you look at me this way?_Pierre brings her water, but Jeanne does not drink it._

JEANNE

Thank you, Pierre, but I don't want it._Silence._

How fragrant the flowers are.Pierre, please give me that
rose--yes, that one.How fresh it is, Emil, and what
a fine fragrance--come over here, Emil!_Emil Grelieu goes over to her and kisses the hand in which she
holds the rose.Looks at her._

JEANNE

_Lowering her hand._

No; I have asked for this flower simply because its fragrance
seems to me immortal--it is always the same--as the sky.How
strange it is, always the same.And when you bring it close to
your face, and close to your eyes, it seems to you that there is
nothing except this red rose and the blue sky.Nothing but the
red rose and the distant, pale--very pale--blue sky....

EMIL GRELIEU

Pierre!People speak of this only at
night, when they are alone with their souls--and she knows it,
but you do not know it yet.JEANNE

_Trembling, opening her eyes._

Yes, I know, Emil.EMIL GRELIEU

The life of the poet does not belong to him.The roof over the
heads of people, which shelters them--all that is a phantom for
me, and my life does not belong to me.I am always far away, not
here--I am always where I am not.You think of finding me among
the living, while I am dead; you are afraid of finding me in
death, mute, cold, doomed to decay, while I live and sing aloud
from my grave.Death which makes people mute, which leaves the
imprint of silence upon the bravest lips, restores the voice
to the poet.Am I--just think of it, Pierre, my boy,--am I to fear
death when in my most persistent searches I could not find the
boundary between life and death, when in my feelings I mix life
and death into one--as two strong, rare kinds of wine?Emil Grelieu looks at his son, smiling.Pierre has
covered his face with his hands.She turns her eyes from her weeping son to her husband._

PIERRE

_Uncovering his face._

Forgive me, father!JEANNE

Take this rose, Pierre, and when it fades and falls apart tear
down another rose--it will have the same fragrance as this one.You are a foolish little boy, Pierre, but I am also foolish,
although Emil is so kind that he thinks differently.Will you be
in the same regiment, Emil?EMIL GRELIEU

No, hardly, Jeanne.PIERRE

Father, it is better that we be in the same regiment.I will
arrange it, father--will you permit me?And I will teach you how
to march--.You know, I am going to be your superior officer.EMIL GRELIEU

_Smiling._

Very well.JEANNE

_Goes out singing in a low voice._

"Only the halo of the arts is crowning--law, liberty, and the
King."Look, Pierre, here is the girl you
wished to see.Come in, come in, my dear child!He is a very good man
and will do you no harm._A girl enters; she is frail, very pale, and beautiful.She
wears a black dress, her hair is combed neatly, and she is
modest in her demeanor.She
is followed by the chambermaid, Silvina, a kind, elderly woman
in a white cap; by Madame Henrietta, and another woman in the
service of the Grelieu household.They stop at the threshold
and watch the girl curiously.The elder woman is weeping as she
looks at her._

GIRL

_Stretching forth her hand to Pierre._

Oh, that is a soldier!Be so kind, soldier, tell me how to go to
Lonua.PIERRE

_Confused._

I do not know, Mademoiselle.GIRL

_Looking at everybody mournfully._

Who knows?JEANNE

_Cautiously and tenderly leading her to a seat._

Sit down, child, take a rest, my dear, give your poor feet a
rest.Pierre, her feet are wounded, yet she wants to walk all
the time.ELDERLY WOMAN

I wanted to stop her, Monsieur Pierre, but it is impossible to
stop her.If we close the door before her the poor girl beats
her head against the walls, like a bird in a cage.François enters from the garden and occupies
himself again with the flowers.He glances at the girl from time
to time.It is evident that he is making painful efforts to hear
and understand what is going on._

GIRL

It is time for me to go.JEANNE

Rest yourself, here, my child!At night it
is so terrible on the roads.There, in the dark air, bullets are
buzzing instead of our dear bees; there wicked people, vicious
beasts are roaming.And there is no one who can tell you, for
there is no one who knows how to go to Lonua.GIRL

Don't you know how I could find my way to Lonua?PIERRE

_Softly._

What is she asking?Emil GRELIEU

Oh, you may speak louder; she can hear as little as François.She is asking about the village which the Prussians have set on
fire.Her home used to be there--now there are only ruins and
corpses there.There is no road that leads to Lonua!GIRL

Don't you know it, either?I have asked everybody,
and no one can tell me how to find my way to Lonua._She rises quickly and walks over to François._

Tell me; you are kindhearted!Don't you know the way to Lonua?_François looks at her intently.Silently he turns away and
walks out, stooping._

JEANNE

_Seating her again._

Sit down, little girl.GIRL

_Sadly._

I am asking, and they are silent.EMIL GRELIEU

I suppose she is also asking the bodies of the dead that lie in
the fields and in the ditches how to go to Lonua.JEANNE

Her hands and her dress were bloodstained.I will hold you in my arms,
and you will feel better and more comfortable, my little child.GIRL

_Softly._

Tell me, how can I find my way to Lonua?JEANNE

Yes, yes, come!Emil, I will go with her to my room.Emil Grelieu and
Pierre remain._

EMIL GRELIEU

Lonua!A quiet little village which no one ever noticed
before--houses, trees, and flowers.Who knows
the way to that little village?Pierre, the soul of our people
is roaming about in the watches of the night, asking the dead
how to find the way to Lonua!Pierre, I cannot endure it any
longer!Oh, weep,
you German Nation--bitter will be the fate of your children,
terrible will be your disgrace before the judgment of the free
nations!_Curtain_



SCENE III


_Night.The dark silhouette of Emil Grelieu's villa stands
out in the background.The gatekeeper's house is seen among
the trees, a dim light in the window.At the cast-iron fence
frightened women are huddled together, watching the fire in the
distance.An alarming redness has covered the sky; only in the
zenith is the sky dark.The reflection of the fire falls upon
objects and people, casting strange shadows against the mirrors
of the mute and dark villa.The voices sound muffled and timid;
there are frequent pauses and prolonged sighs.HENRIETTA

My God, my God!It is burning and burning,
and there is no end to the fire!SECOND WOMAN

Yesterday it was burning further away, and tonight the fire is
nearer.HENRIETTA

It is burning and burning, there is no end to the fire!Today
the sun was covered in a mist.SECOND WOMAN

It is forever burning, and the sun is growing ever darker!Now
it is lighter at night than in the daytime!SILVINA

I am afraid!HENRIETTA

Be silent, Silvina, be silent!_Silence._

SECOND WOMAN

I can't hear a sound.If I close my eyes
it seems to me that nothing is going on there.HENRIETTA

I can see all that is going on there even with my eyes closed.SILVINA

Oh, I am afraid!SECOND WOMAN

Where is it burning?HENRIETTA

I don't know.It is burning and burning, and there is no end to
the fire!It may be that they have all perished by this time.It may be that something terrible is going on there, and we are
looking on and know nothing._A fourth woman approaches them quietly._

FOURTH WOMAN

Good evening!SILVINA

_With restraint._

Oh!HENRIETTA

Oh, you have frightened us!FOURTH WOMAN

Good evening, Madame Henrietta!Never mind my coming here--it
is terrible to stay in the house!I guessed that you were not
sleeping, but here, watching.And we can't hear a sound--how quiet!HENRIETTA

It is burning and burning.Haven't you heard anything about your
husband?FOURTH WOMAN

No, nothing.HENRIETTA

And with whom are your children just now?FOURTH WOMAN

Alone.Is it true that Monsieur Pierre was
killed?HENRIETTA

_Agitated._

Just imagine!I simply cannot understand what is
going on!You see, there is no one in the house now, and we are
afraid to sleep there--

SECOND WOMAN

The three of us sleep here, in the gatekeeper's house.HENRIETTA

I am afraid to look into that house even in the daytime--the
house is so large and so empty!And there are no men there, not
a soul--

FOURTH WOMAN

Is it true that François has gone to shoot the Prussians?Everybody is talking about it, but we don't know.He
disappeared quietly, like a mouse.FOURTH WOMAN

He will be hanged--the Prussians hang such people!HENRIETTA

Wait, wait!Today, while I was in the garden, I heard the
telephone ringing in the house; it was ringing for a long time.I was frightened, but I went in after all--and, just think of
it!Some one said: "Monsieur Pierre was killed!"SECOND WOMAN

And nothing more?HENRIETTA

Nothing more; not a word!I felt so bad
and was so frightened that I could hardly run out.Now I will
not enter that house for anything!FOURTH WOMAN

Whose voice was it?SECOND WOMAN

Madame Henrietta says it was an unfamiliar voice.HENRIETTA

Yes, an unfamiliar voice.There seems to be a light in the windows of the
house--somebody is there!SILVINA

Oh, I am afraid!HENRIETTA

Oh, what are you saying; what are you saying?SECOND WOMAN

That's from the redness of the sky!FOURTH WOMAN

What if some one is ringing there again?HENRIETTA

How is that possible?Silence._

SECOND WOMAN

What will become of us?They are coming this way, and there is
nothing that can stop them!FOURTH WOMAN

I wish I might die now!When you are dead, you don't hear or see
anything.HENRIETTA

It keeps on all night like this--it is burning and burning!And
in the daytime it will again be hard to see things on account of
the smoke; and the bread will smell of burning!FOURTH WOMAN

They have killed Monsieur Pierre.SECOND WOMAN

They have killed him?SILVINA

You must not speak of it!_Weeps softly._

FOURTH WOMAN

They say there are twenty millions of them, and they have
already set Paris on fire.They say they have cannon which can
hit a hundred kilometers away.HENRIETTA

My God, my God!SECOND WOMAN

Merciful God, have pity on us!FOURTH WOMAN

And they are flying and they are hurling bombs from
airships--terrible bombs, which destroy entire cities!HENRIETTA

My God!Before this You were
alone in the sky, and now those base Prussians are there too!SECOND WOMAN

Before this, when my soul wanted rest and joy I looked at the
sky, but now there is no place where a poor soul can find rest
and joy!FOURTH WOMAN

They have taken everything away from our Belgium--even the sky!Don't you think that now my husband, my husband--

HENRIETTA

No, no!FOURTH WOMAN

Why is the sky so red?SECOND WOMAN

Have mercy on us, O God!The redness of the flames seems to be swaying over the
earth._

_Curtain_



SCENE IV


_Dawn.The sun has already risen, but it is hidden behind the
heavy mist and smoke._

_A large room in Emil Grelieu's villa, which has been turned
into a sickroom.There are two wounded there, Grelieu himself,
with a serious wound in his shoulder, and his son Maurice, with
a light wound on his right arm.The large window, covered with
half transparent curtains, admits a faint bluish light.In an armchair at the bedside of
Grelieu there is a motionless figure in white, Jeanne_.EMIL GRELIEU

_Softly._

Jeanne!JEANNE

Shall I give you some water?EMIL GRELIEU

No.JEANNE

Oh, no, not at all.Can't you fall
asleep, Emil?EMIL GRELIEU

What time is it?_She goes over to the window quietly, and pushing the curtain
aside slightly, looks at her little watch.Then she returns just
as quietly._

JEANNE

It is still early.Perhaps you will try to fall asleep, Emil?It
seems to me that you have been suffering great pain; you have
been groaning all night.EMIL GRELIEU

No, I am feeling better.JEANNE

Nasty weather, Emil; you can't see the sun.Suddenly Maurice utters a cry in his sleep; the cry
turns into a groan and indistinct mumbling.Jeanne walks over to
him and listens, then returns to her seat._

EMIL GRELIEU

Is the boy getting on well?JEANNE

Don't worry, Emil.He only said a few words in his sleep.EMIL GRELIEU

He has done it several times tonight.JEANNE

I am afraid that he is disturbing you.We can have him removed
to another room and Henrietta will stay with him.The boy's
blood is in good condition.In another week, I believe, we shall
be able to remove the bandage from his arm.EMIL GRELIEU

No, let him stay here, Jeanne.JEANNE

What is it, my dear?_She kneels at his bed and kisses his hand carefully._

EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne!JEANNE

I think your fever has gone down, my dear._Impresses another kiss upon his hand and clings to it._

EMIL GRELIEU

You are my love, Jeanne.JEANNE

Do not speak, do not speak._A brief moment of silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

_Moving his head restlessly._

It is so hard to breathe here, the air----

JEANNE

The window has been open all night, my dear.There is not a
breeze outside.EMIL GRELIEU

There is smoke.MAURICE

_Utters a cry once more, then mutters_--

Stop, stop, stop!_Again indistinctly._

It is burning, it is burning!Who is going to the battery,
who is going to the battery----

_He mutters and then grows silent._

EMIL GRELIEU

What painful dreams!JEANNE

That's nothing; the boy always used to talk in his sleep.EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne!JEANNE

What is it, my dear?EMIL GRELIEU

Sit down.EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne.... Are you thinking about Pierre?_Silence._

JEANNE

_Softly._

Don't speak of him.EMIL GRELIEU

You are right.JEANNE

_After a brief pause._

That's true.EMIL GRELIEU

We shall follow him later.He will not come here, but we shall
go to him.Do you
remember the red rose which you gave him?EMIL GRELIEU

It is so clear.You are the best woman in
the world._Silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

_Tossing about in his bed._

It is so hard to breathe.JEANNE

My dear----

EMIL GRELIEU

No, that's nothing.Jeanne, was I
dreaming, or have I really heard cannonading?JEANNE

You really heard it, at about five o'clock.But very far away,
Emil--it was hardly audible.Close your eyes, my dear, rest
yourself._Silence_

MAURICE

_Faintly._

Mamma!_Jeanne walks over to him quietly._

JEANNE

Are you awake?JEANNE

He is awake.EMIL GRELIEU

Good morning, Maurice.MAURICE

Good morning, papa.EMIL GRELIEU

I, too, am feeling well.Jeanne, you may draw the curtain aside.Still it will be easier for you to
breathe when it is light._She draws the curtain aside slowly, so as not to make it too
light at once.Beyond the large window vague silhouettes of the
trees are seen at the window frames and several withered, bent
flowers.Maurice is trying to adjust the screen._

JEANNE

What are you doing, Maurice?MAURICE

My coat--Never mind, I'll fix it myself._Guiltily._

No, mamma, you had better help me.JEANNE

_Going behind the screen._

What a foolish boy you are, Maurice._Behind the screen._

Be careful, be careful, that's the way.MAURICE

_Behind the screen._

Pin this for me right here, as you did yesterday.JEANNE

_Behind the screen._

Of course._Maurice comes out, his right arm dressed in a bandage.He goes
over to his father and first kisses his hand, then, upon a sign
from his eyes, he kisses him on the lips._

EMIL GRELIEU

Good morning, good morning, my dear boy.MAURICE

_Looking around at the screen, where his mother is putting the
bed in order._

Papa, look!_He takes his hand out of the bandage and straightens it
quickly.Emil Grelieu
threatens him with his finger.Jeanne puts the screen aside, and
the bed is already in order._

JEANNE

I am through now.MAURICE

Oh, no; under no circumstances.Last
night I washed myself with my left hand and it was very fine._Walking over to the open window._

How nasty it is.These scoundrels have spoiled the day.Still,
it is warm and there is the smell of flowers.It's good, papa;
it is very fine.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, it is pleasant.MAURICE

Well, I am going.JEANNE

Clean your teeth; you didn't do it yesterday, Maurice._

What's the use of it now?_

Papa, do you know, well have good news today; I feel it._He is heard calling in a ringing voice, "Silvina."_

EMIL GRELIEU

I feel better.JEANNE

I'll let you have your coffee directly.You are looking much
better today, much better.EMIL GRELIEU

What is this?JEANNE

Perfume, with water.I'll bathe your face with it That's the
way.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.JEANNE

He didn't mean anything.He is very happy because he is a hero.EMIL GRELIEU

Do you know any news?JEANNE

_Irresolutely._

Nothing.EMIL GRELIEU

Tell me, Jeanne; you were firmer before.JEANNE

Was I firmer?Perhaps.... I have grown accustomed to talk to
you softly at night.Well--how shall I tell it to you?EMIL GRELIEU

Coming?Don't be excited, but I
think that it will be necessary for us to leave for Antwerp
today.EMIL GRELIEU

Are they near?JEANNE

Yes, they are near._Sings softly._

"Le Roi, la Loi, la Liberté."I have not told you
that the King inquired yesterday about your health.I answered
that you were feeling better and that you will be able to leave
today.EMIL GRELIEU

Of course I am able to leave today.JEANNE

What did the King say?_Singing the same tune._

He said that their numbers were too great.EMIL GRELIEU

What else did he say?He said that there was a God and there was
righteousness.That's what I believe I heard him say--that there
was still a God and that righteousness was still in existence.But it is so good that they still
exist._Silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, in the daytime you are so different.Where do you get so
much strength, Jeanne?EMIL GRELIEU

I am forever looking at your hair.I am wondering why it hasn't
turned gray.JEANNE

I dye it at night, Emil.Oh, yes, I haven't told you yet--some one
will be here to see you today--Secretary Lagard and some one
else by the name of Count Clairmont.EMIL GRELIEU

Count Clairmont?JEANNE

It is not necessary that you should know him.He is simply known
as Count Clairmont, Count Clairmont--.That's a good name for a
very good man.EMIL GRELIEU

I know a very good man in Belgium--

JEANNE

Tsh!You must only remember--Count
Clairmont.They have some important matters to discuss with you,
I believe.And they'll send you an automobile, to take you to
Antwerp.EMIL GRELIEU

_Smiling._

Count Clairmont?JEANNE

_Also smiling._

Yes.You are loved by everybody, but if I were a King, I would
have sent you an aeroplane._Throwing back her hands in sorrow which she is trying vainly to
suppress._

Ah, how good it would be now to rise from the ground and
fly--and fly for a long, long time._Enter Maurice._

MAURICE

I am ready now, I have cleaned my teeth.I've even taken a walk
in the garden.But I have never before noticed that we have such
a beautiful garden!JEANNE

Coffee will be ready directly.If he disturbs you with his talk,
call me, Emil.MAURICE

Oh, I did not mean to disturb you.I'll not
disturb you any more.EMIL GRELIEU

You may speak, speak.JEANNE

But you must save your strength, don't forget that, Emil._Exit._

MAURICE

_Sitting down quietly at the window._

Perhaps I really ought not to speak, papa?EMIL GRELIEU

_Smiling faintly._

Can you be silent?MAURICE

_Blushing._

No, father, I cannot just now.I suppose I seem to you very
young.EMIL GRELIEU

And what do you think of it yourself?MAURICE

_Blushing again._

I am no longer as young as I was three weeks ago.Yes, only
three weeks ago--I remember the tolling of the bells in our
church, I remember how I teased François.How strange that
François has been lost and no one knows where he is.What does
it mean that a human being is lost and no one knows where he is?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.But need an old
man love his fatherland less than I love it, for instance?The
old people love it even more intensely.I am not tiring you, am I?An old man came to us, he was
very feeble, he asked for bullets--well, let them hang me too--I
gave him bullets.A few of our regiment made sport of him, but
he said: "If only one Prussian bullet will strike me, it means
that the Prussians will have one bullet less."EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, that appeals to me, too.Have you heard the cannonading at
dawn?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.Did mamma tell you that they are
coming nearer and nearer?MAURICE

_Rising._

Really?EMIL GRELIEU

They are coming, and we must leave for Antwerp today._He rises and walks back and forth, forgetting his wounded arm.Clenches his fist._

MAURICE

Father, tell me: What do you think of the present state of
affairs?EMIL GRELIEU

Mamma says there is a God and there is righteousness.MAURICE

_Raising his hand._

Mamma says----Let God bless mamma!_His face twitches like a child's face.He is trying to repress
his tears._

MAURICE

I still owe them something for Pierre.Forgive me, father; I
don't know whether I have a right to say this or not, but I am
altogether different from you.It is wicked but I can't help it.I was looking this morning at your flowers in the garden and I
felt so sorry--sorry for you, because you had grown them.EMIL GRELIEU

Maurice!MAURICE

The scoundrels!I don't want to consider them human beings, and
I shall not consider them human beings._Enter Jeanne._

JEANNE

What is it, Maurice?_As he passes he embraces his mother with his left hand and
kisses her._

JEANNE

You had better sit down.It is dangerous for your health to walk
around this way.EMIL GRELIEU

Sit down, Maurice._Maurice sits down at the window facing the garden.Emil Grelieu
smiles sadly and closes his eyes.Silvina, the maid, brings in
coffee and sets it on the table near Grelieu's bed._

SILVINA

Good morning, Monsieur Emil.EMIL GRELIEU

_Opening his eyes._

Good morning, Silvina._Exit Silvina._

JEANNE

Go and have your breakfast, Maurice.MAURICE

_Without turning around._

I don't want any breakfast.Mamma, I'll take off my bandage
tomorrow.JEANNE

_Laughing._

Soldier, is it possible that you are capricious?Jeanne helps Emil Grelieu with his coffee._

JEANNE

That's the way.Is it convenient for you this way, or do you
want to drink it with a spoon?EMIL GRELIEU

Oh, my poor head, it is so weak--

MAURICE

_Going over to him._

Forgive me, father, I'll not do it any more.I was foolishly
excited, but do you know I could not endure it.May I have a
cup, mamma?JEANNE

Yes, this is yours.MAURICE

Yes, I do.EMIL GRELIEU

I am feeling perfectly well today, Jeanne.When is the bandage
to be changed?Count Clairmont will bring his surgeon along with him.MAURICE

Who is that, mamma?JEANNE

You'll see him.But, please, Maurice, when you see him, don't
open your mouth so wide.You have a habit--you open your mouth
and then you forget about it.MAURICE

_Blushing._

You are both looking at me and smiling._The sound of automobiles is heard._

JEANNE

_Rising quickly._

I think they are here.Maurice, this is only Count Clairmont,
don't forget.They will speak with you
about a very, very important matter, Emil, but you must not be
agitated.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, I know.JEANNE

_Kissing him quickly._

I am going._Exit, almost colliding with Silvina, who is excited._

MAURICE

_Whispering._

Who is it, Silvina?_Silvina makes some answer in mingled delight and awe.Maurice's
face assumes the same expression as Silvina's.Maurice walks quickly to the window and raises his left hand to
his forehead, straightening himself in military fashion.Thus he
stands until the others notice him._

_Enter Jeanne, Count Clairmont, followed by Secretary Lagard and
the Count's adjudant, an elderly General of stem appearance,
with numerous decorations upon his chest.The Count himself
is tall, well built and young, in a modest officer's uniform,
without any medals to signify his high station.He carries
himself very modestly, almost bashfully, but overcoming his
first uneasiness, he speaks warmly and powerfully and freely.All treat him with profound respect._

_Lagard is a strong old man with a leonine gray head.He speaks
simply, his gestures are calm and resolute.It is evident that
he is in the habit of speaking from a platform._

_Jeanne holds a large bouquet of flowers in her hands.Count
Clairmont walks directly toward Grelieu's bedside._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Confused._

I have come to shake hands with you, my dear master.Oh, but
do not make a single unnecessary movement, not a single one,
otherwise I shall be very unhappy!EMIL GRELIEU

I am deeply moved, I am happy.COUNT CLAIRMONT

No, no, don't speak that way.Here stands before you only a man
who has learned to think from your books.But see what they have
done to you--look, Lagard!LAGARD

How are you, Grelieu?I, too, want to shake your hand.Today I
am a Secretary by the will of Fate, but yesterday I was only a
physician, and I may congratulate you--you have a kind hand.GENERAL

_Coming forward modestly._

Allow me, too, in the name of this entire army of ours to
express to you our admiration, Monsieur Grelieu!EMIL GRELIEU

I thank you.COUNT CLAIRMONT

But perhaps it is necessary to have a surgeon?JEANNE

He can listen and talk, Count.COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Noticing Maurice, confused._

Oh!Please put down your hand--you are wounded.MAURICE

I am so happy, Count.JEANNE

This is our second son.Our first son, Pierre, was killed at
Liège--

COUNT CLAIRMONT

I dare not console you, Madame Grelieu.Give me your hand,
Maurice.I dare not--

COUNT CLAIRMONT

My dear young man, I, too, am nothing but a soldier now.My children and my wife
have sent you flowers--but where are they?JEANNE

Here they are, Count.COUNT CLAIRMONT

Thank you.But I did not know that your flowers were better than
mine, for my flowers smell of smoke._To Count Clairmont._

His pulse is good.Grelieu, we have come to you not only to
express our sympathy.Through me all the working people of
Belgium are shaking your hand.EMIL GRELIEU

I am proud of it, Lagard.LAGARD

But we are just as proud.Yes; there is something we must
discuss with you.Count Clairmont did not wish to disturb you,
but I said: "Let him die, but before that we must speak to him."EMIL GRELIEU

I am not dying.Maurice, I think you had better go out.COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Quickly._

Oh, no, no.He is your son, Grelieu, and he should be present to
hear what his father will say.Oh, I should have been proud to
have such a father.LAGARD

Our Count is a very fine young man--Pardon me, Count, I have
again upset our--

COUNT CLAIRMONT

That's nothing, I have already grown accustomed to it.Master,
it is necessary for you and your family to leave for Antwerp
today.EMIL GRELIEU

Are our affairs in such a critical condition?LAGARD

What is there to tell?That
horde of Huns is coming upon us like the tide of the sea.Today
they are still there, but tomorrow they will flood your house,
Grelieu.To what can we resort
in our defence?On this side are they, and there is the sea.Only very little is left of Belgium, Grelieu.Very soon there
will be no room even for my beard here.Dull sounds of cannonading are heard in the distance.All turn their eyes to the window._

EMIL GRELIEU

Is that a battle?COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Listening, calmly._

No, that is only the beginning.But tomorrow they will carry
their devilish weapons past your house.Do you know they are
real iron monsters, under whose weight our earth is quaking
and groaning.They are moving slowly, like amphibia that have
crawled out at night from the abyss--but they are moving!Another few days will pass, and they will crawl over to Antwerp,
they will turn their jaws to the city, to the churches--Woe to
Belgium, master!LAGARD

Yes, it is very bad.We are an honest and peaceful people
despising bloodshed, for war is such a stupid affair!And we
should not have had a single soldier long ago were it not for
this accursed neighbor, this den of murderers.GENERAL

And what would we have done without any soldiers, Monsieur
Lagard?LAGARD

And what can we do with soldiers, Monsieur General?COUNT CLAIRMONT

You are wrong, Lagard.With our little army there is still one
possibility--to die as freemen die.But without an army we would
have been bootblacks, Lagard!LAGARD

_Grumbling._

Well, I would not clean anybody's boots.Things are in bad
shape, Grelieu, in very bad shape.And there is but one remedy
left for us--.EMIL GRELIEU

I know.EMIL GRELIEU

The dam._Jeanne and Emil shudder and look at each other with terror in
their eyes._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

You shuddered, you are shuddering, madame.But what am I to do,
what are we to do, we who dare not shudder?JEANNE

Oh, I simply thought of a girl who was trying to find her way to
Lonua.She will never find her way to Lonua.COUNT CLAIRMONT

But what is to be done?The Count steps away to the window
and looks out, nervously twitching his mustaches.Maurice has
moved aside and, as before, stands at attention.Jeanne stands
a little distance away from him, with her shoulder leaning
against the wall, her beautiful pale head thrown back.Lagard is
sitting at the bedside as before, stroking his gray, disheveled
beard.The General is absorbed in gloomy thoughts._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Turning around resolutely._

I am a peaceful man, but I can understand why people take up
arms.That means a sword, a gun, explosive contrivances.Fire is killing people, but at the same time it
also gives light.There is something of the
ancient sacrifice in it.cold, dark, silent, covering
with mire, causing bodies to swell--water, which was the
beginning of chaos; water, which is guarding the earth by day
and night in order to rush upon it.My friend, believe me, I am
quite a daring man, but I am afraid of water!Lagard, what would
you say to that?LAGARD

We Belgians have too long been struggling against the water not
to have learned to fear it.JEANNE

But what is more terrible, the Prussians or water?GENERAL

_Bowing._

Madame is right.The Prussians are not more terrible, but they
are worse.It is terrible to release water
from captivity, the beast from its den, nevertheless it is a
better friend to us than the Prussians.I would prefer to see
the whole of Belgium covered with water rather than extend a
hand of reconciliation to a scoundrel!Neither they nor we shall
live to see that, even if the entire Atlantic Ocean rush over
our heads._Brief pause._

GENERAL

But I hope that we shall not come to that.Meanwhile it is
necessary for us to flood only part of our territory.JEANNE

_Her eyes closed, her head hanging down._

And what is to be done with those who could not abandon their
homes, who are deaf, who are sick and alone?_Silence._

JEANNE

There in the fields and in the ditches are the wounded.There
the shadows of people are wandering about, but in their veins
there is still warm blood.Oh, don't
look at me like that, Emil; you had better not listen to what I
am saying.I have spoken so only because my heart is wrung with
pain--it isn't necessary to listen to me at all, Count._Count Clairmont walks over to Grelieu's bed quickly and firmly.At first he speaks confusedly, seeking the right word; then he
speaks ever more boldly and firmly._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

My dear and honored master!We would not have dared to take
from you even a drop of your health, if--if it were not for the
assurance that serving your people may give new strength to your
heroic soul!Yesterday, it was resolved at our council to break
the dams and flood part of our kingdom, but I could not, I dared
not, give my full consent before I knew what you had to say to
this plan.I did not sleep all night long, thinking--oh, how
terrible, how inexpressibly sad my thoughts were!We are the
body, we are the hands, we are the head--while you, Grelieu, you
are the conscience of our people.Blinded by the war, we may
unwillingly, unwittingly, altogether against our will, violate
man-made laws.We are driven to despair, we have no Belgium any longer,
it is trampled by our enemies, but in your breast, Emil Grelieu,
the heart of all Belgium is beating--and your answer will be the
answer of our tormented, blood-stained, unfortunate land!Maurice is crying, looking at his
father._

LAGARD

_Softly._

Bravo, Belgium!The sound of cannonading is heard._

JEANNE

_Softly, to Maurice._

Sit down, Maurice, it is hard for you to stand.MAURICE

Oh, mamma!I am so happy to stand here now--

LAGARD

Now I shall add a few words.As you know, Grelieu, I am a man of
the people.I know the price the people pay for their hard work.I know the cost of all these gardens, orchards and factories
which we shall bury under the water.They have cost us sweat
and health and tears, Grelieu.These are our sufferings which
will be transformed into joy for our children.But as a nation
that loves and respects liberty above its sweat and blood and
tears--as a nation, I say, I would prefer that sea waves should
seethe here over our heads rather than that we should have to
black the boots of the Prussians.And if nothing but islands
remain of Belgium they will be known as "honest islands," and
the islanders will be Belgians as before._All are agitated._

EMIL GRELIEU

And what do the engineers say?GENERAL

_Respectfully waiting for the Count's answer._

Monsieur Grelieu, they say this can be done in two hours.LAGARD

_Grumbles._

In two hours!How many years have we been building
it!GENERAL

The engineers were crying when they said it, Monsieur.LAGARD

The engineers were crying?_Suddenly he bursts into sobs, and slowly takes a handkerchief
from his pocket._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

We are awaiting your answer impatiently, Grelieu.You are
charged with a grave responsibility to your fatherland--to lift
your hand against your own fatherland.EMIL GRELIEU Have we no other defence?Lagard dries
his eyes and slowly answers with a sigh_.JEANNE

_Shaking her head._

No.COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Rapidly._

We must gain time, Grelieu.By the power of all our lives,
thrown in the fields, we cannot stop them._Stamping his foot._

Time, time!We must steal from fate a small part of eternity--a
few days, a week!The Russians are
coming to us from the East.The German steel has already
penetrated to the heart of the French land--and infuriated with
pain, the French eagle is rising over the Germans' bayonets
and is coming toward us!The noble knights of the sea--the
British--are already rushing toward us, and to Belgium are their
powerful arms stretched out over the abyss.Belgium is praying for a few days, for
a few hours!You have already given to Belgium your blood,
Grelieu, and you have the right to lift your hand against your
blood-stained fatherland!_Brief pause._

EMIL GRELIEU

We must break the dams._Curtain_



SCENE V


_Night.A sentinel
on guard at the door leading to the rooms occupied by the
Commander of the army.Two officers on duty are
talking lazily, suffering apparently from the heat.Only from time to time the measured footsteps of
pickets are heard, and muffled voices and angry exclamations._

VON RITZAU

Do you feel sleepy, von Stein?VON STEIN

I don't feel sleepy, but I feel like smoking.RITZAU

A bad habit!STEIN

But what if _he_ should come in?Not a breath of pure air enters the lungs.The air is poisoned with the smell of smoke.We must invent
something against this obnoxious odor.RITZAU

I am not an inventor.First of all it is necessary to wring out
the air as they wring the clothes they wash, and dry it in the
sun.It is so moist, I feel as though I were diving in it.Do
you know whether _he_ is in a good mood today?STEIN

Why, is he subject to moods, good or bad?RITZAU

Great self-restraint!STEIN

Have you ever seen him undressed--or half-dressed?Or have you
ever seen his hair in disorder?RITZAU

He speaks so devilishly little, Stein.STEIN

He prefers to have his cannon speak.It is quite a powerful
voice, isn't it, Ritzau?A tall, handsome officer enters quickly and
goes toward the door leading to the room of the Commander._

Blumenfeld!_The tall officer waves his hand and opens the door cautiously,
ready to make his bow._

He is malting his career!RITZAU

He is a good fellow.STEIN

Would you rather be in Paris?RITZAU

I would prefer any less unbearable country to this.How dull it
must be here in the winter time.STEIN

But we have saved them from dullness for a long time to come.Were you ever in the Montmartre cafés, Ritzau?STEIN

Doesn't one find there a wonderful refinement, culture and
innate elegance?Unfortunately, our Berlin people are far
different.RITZAU

Oh, of course._The tall officer comes out of the door, stepping backward.He
heaves a sigh of relief and sits down near the two officers.Takes out a cigar._

VON BLUMENFELD How are things?STEIN

Then I am going to smoke too.BLUMENFELD

You may smoke.He is not coming out Do you want to hear
important news?BLUMENFELD He laughed just now I

STEIN

Really!BLUMENFELD

Upon my word of honor!And he touched my shoulder with two
fingers--do you understand?STEIN

_With envy._

Of course!I suppose you brought him good news, Blumenfeld?_The military telegraphist, standing at attention, hands
Blumenfeld a folded paper._

TELEGRAPHIST

A radiogram, Lieutenant!BLUMENFELD

Let me have it._Slowly he puts his cigar on the window sill and enters the
Commander's room cautiously._

STEIN

He's a lucky fellow.You may say what you please about luck,
but it exists.Von?--Did you know his
father?RITZAU

I have reason to believe that he had no grandfather at all._Blumenfeld comes out and rejoins the two officers, taking up
his cigar._

STEIN

Another military secret?BLUMENFELD

Of course.Everything that is said and done here is a military
secret.The information we have
received concerns our new siege guns--they are advancing
successfully.BLUMENFELD

Yes, successfully.They have just passed the most difficult part
of the road--you know where the swamps are--

STEIN

Oh, yes.BLUMENFELD

The road could not support the heavy weight and caved in.He ordered a report about the
movement at each and every kilometer.STEIN

Now he will sleep in peace.BLUMENFELD

He never sleeps, von Stein.BLUMENFELD

He never sleeps, von Stein!When he is not listening to
reports or issuing commands, he is thinking.As the personal
correspondent of his Highness I have the honor to know many
things which others are not allowed to know--Oh, gentlemen, he
has a wonderful mind!_Another very young officer enters, stands at attention before
Blumenfeld._

BLUMENFELD

Sit down, von Schauss.BLUMENFELD

He has a German philosophical mind which manages guns as
Leibnitz managed ideas.Everything is preconceived, everything
is prearranged, the movement of our millions of people has been
elaborated into such a remarkable system that Kant himself
would have been proud of it.Gentlemen, we are led forward by
indomitable logic and by an iron will._The officers express their approval by subdued exclamations of
"bravo."_

BLUMENFELD

How can he sleep, if the movement of our armies is but the
movement of parts of his brains!And what is the use of sleep
in general?I sleep very little myself, and I advise you,
gentlemen, not to indulge in foolish sleep.RITZAU

But our human organism requires sleep.BLUMENFELD

Nonsense!Organism--that is something invented by the doctors
who are looking for practice among the fools.I know only my desires and my will, which says:
"Gerhardt, do this!SCHAUSS

Will you permit me to take down your words in my notebook?BLUMENFELD

Please, Schauss._The telegraphist has entered._

ZIGLER

I really don't know, but something strange has happened.It
seems that we are being interfered with, I can't understand
anything.BLUMENFELD

What is it?ZIGLER

We can make out one word, "Water"--but after that all is
incomprehensible.And then again, "Water"--

BLUMENFELD

What water?ZIGLER

He is also surprised and cannot understand.BLUMENFELD

You are a donkey, Zigler!We'll have to call out--

_The Commander comes out.His voice is dry and unimpassioned._

COMMANDER

Blumenfeld!_All jump up, straighten themselves, as if petrified._

What is this?BLUMENFELD

I have not yet investigated it, your Highness.Zigler is
reporting--

COMMANDER

What is it, Zigler?ZIGLER

Your Highness, we are being interfered with.I don't know what
it is, but I can't understand anything.We have been able to
make out only one word--"Water."COMMANDER

_Turning around._

See what it is, Blumenfeld, and report to me--

_Engineer runs in._

ENGINEER

Where is Blumenfeld?COMMANDER

_Pausing._

What has happened there, Kloetz?ENGINEER

They don't respond to our calls, your Highness.COMMANDER

You think something serious has happened?ENGINEER

I dare not think so, your Highness, but I am alarmed.Silence is
the only answer to our most energetic calls._The second telegraphist has entered quietly._

GREITZER

They are silent, your Highness._Brief pause._

COMMANDER

_Again turning to the door._

Please investigate this, Lieutenant._He advances a step to the door, then stops.There is a
commotion behind the windows--a noise and the sound of voices.The noise keeps
growing, turning at times into a loud roar._

What is that?An officer, bareheaded, rushes in
excitedly, his hair disheveled, his face pale._

OFFICER

I want to see his Highness.BLUMENFELD

_Hissing._

You are insane!COMMANDER

Calm yourself, officer.I have the honor to report to you that the
Belgians have burst the dams, and our armies are flooded._With horror._

We must hurry, your Highness!OFFICER

They are flooded, your Highness.COMMANDER

Compose yourself, you are not behaving properly!I am asking you
about our field guns--

OFFICER

They are flooded, your Highness.We must hurry, your Highness, we are in a valley.They have broken the dams; and the water is
rushing this way violently.It is only five kilometers away from
here--and we can hardly--.The beginning of a terrible panic is felt,
embracing the entire camp.All watch impatiently the reddening
face of the Commander._

COMMANDER

But this is--

_He strikes the table with his fist forcibly._

Absurd!_He looks at them with cold fury, but all lower their eyes.The
frightened officer is trembling and gazing at the window.The
lights grow brighter outside--it is evident that a building has
been set on fire.A
dull noise, then the crash of shots is heard.The discipline is
disappearing gradually._

BLUMENFELD

They have gone mad!STEIN

But that can't be the Belgians!RITZAU

They may have availed themselves--

BLUMENFELD

Aren't you ashamed, Stein?I beg of you--

_Suddenly a piercing, wild sound of a horn is heard ordering to
retreat.The roaring sound is growing rapidly._

COMMANDER

_Shots._

Who has commanded to retreat?_Blumenfeld lowers his head._

COMMANDER

This is not the German Army!You are unworthy of being called
soldiers!BLUMENFELD

_Stepping forward, with dignity._

Your Highness!We are not fishes to swim in the water!_Runs out, followed by two or three others.The panic is
growing._

BLUMENFELD

Your Highness!Your life is in danger--your
Highness.Only the
sentinel remains in the position of one petrified._

BLUMENFELD

Your Highness!Your life--I am afraid that
another minute, and it will be too late!COMMANDER

But this is--

_Again strikes the table with his fist._

But this is absurd, Blumenfeld!_Curtain_



SCENE VI


_The same hour of night.In the darkness it is difficult to
discern the silhouettes of the ruined buildings and of the
trees.At the right, a half-destroyed bridge.From time to time the German flashlights are
seen across the dark sky.Near the bridge, an automobile in
which the wounded Emil Grelieu and his son are being carried to
Antwerp.Jeanne and a young physician are with them.Something
has broken down in the automobile and a soldier-chauffeur is
bustling about with a lantern trying to repair it.Langloi
stands near him._


DOCTOR

_Uneasily._

Well?CHAUFFEUR

_Examining._

I don't know yet.DOCTOR

Is it a serious break?CHAUFFEUR

No--I don't know.MAURICE

_From the automobile._

What is it, Doctor?CHAUFFEUR

_Angrily._

We'll start!DOCTOR

I don't know.MAURICE

Shall we stay here long?DOCTOR

_To the chauffeur._

Shall we stay here long?CHAUFFEUR

_Angrily._

How do I know?_Hands the lantern to the doctor._

MAURICE

Then I will come out.JEANNE

You had better stay here, Maurice.MAURICE

No, mother, I am careful._Jumps off and watches the chauffeur at work._

MAURICE

How unfortunate that we are stuck here!CHAUFFEUR

_Grumbling._

A bridge!DOCTOR

Yes, it is unfortunate.MAURICE

_Shrugging his shoulders._

Father did not want to leave.Mamina, do
you think our people are already in Antwerp?JEANNE

Yes, I think so.EMIL GRELIEU

No.It is very pleasant to breathe the fresh air.DOCTOR

_To Maurice._

I think we are still in the region which--

MAURICE

Yes.DOCTOR

_Looking at his watch._

Twenty--a quarter of ten.MAURICE

Then it is a quarter of an hour since the bursting of the dams.Mamma, do you hear, it is a quarter of ten now!JEANNE

Yes, I hear.MAURICE

But it is strange that we haven't heard any explosions.DOCTOR

How can you say that, Monsieur Maurice?MAURICE

I thought that such explosions would be heard a hundred
kilometers away.Our house and our
garden will soon be flooded!I wonder how high the water will
rise.Do you think it will reach up to the second story?CHAUFFEUR

_Grumbling._

I am working.Mamma, see how the searchlights are working.EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne, lift me a little.JEANNE

My dear, I don't know whether I am allowed to do it.DOCTOR

You may lift him a little, if it isn't very painful.JEANNE

Do you feel any pain?EMIL GRELIEU

No.MAURICE

Father, they are flashing the searchlights across the sky like
madmen._A bluish light is flashed over them, faintly illuminating the
whole group._

MAURICE

Right into my eyes!EMIL GRELIEU

I suppose so.Either they have been warned, or the water is
reaching them by this time.JEANNE

Do you think so, Emil?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.It seems to me that I hear the sound of the water from that
side._All listen and look in the direction from which the noise came._

DOCTOR

_Uneasily._

How unpleasant this is!MAURICE

Father, it seems to me I hear voices.Listen--it sounds as
though they are crying there.Father, the
Prussians are crying._A distant, dull roaring of a crowd is heard.The searchlights are
swaying from side to side._

EMIL GRELIEU

It is they.DOCTOR

If we don't start in a quarter of an hour--

EMIL GRELIEU

In half an hour, Doctor.MAURICE

Father, how beautiful and how terrible it is!JEANNE

What is it?MAURICE

I want to kiss it.JEANNE

What a foolish little boy you are, Maurice.MAURICE

Monsieur Langloi said that in three days from now I may remove
my bandage.Just think of it, in three days I shall be able to
take up my gun again!...The
chauffeur and the doctor draw their revolvers.A figure appears
from the field, approaching from one of the ditches.A peasant,
wounded in the leg, comes up slowly, leaning upon a cane._

MAURICE

Who is there?PEASANT

Our own, our own.MAURICE

Yes, we're going to the city.Our car has broken down, we're
repairing it.PEASANT

What am I doing here?They also look at him
attentively, by the light of the lantern._

CHAUFFEUR

Give me the light!PEASANT

Are you carrying a wounded man?I
cannot walk, it is very hard.I lay there in the ditch and when I heard you
speak French I crawled out.DOCTOR

How were you wounded?PEASANT

I was walking in the field and they shot me.They must have
thought I was a rabbit._Laughs hoarsely._

They must have thought I was a rabbit.What is the news,
gentlemen?MAURICE

Don't you know?PEASANT

What can I know?I lay there and looked at the sky--that's all I
know.Just look at it, I have been watching
it all the time.What is that I see in the sky, eh?EMIL GRELIEU

Sit down near us.MAURICE

Listen, sit down here.They are
crying there--the Prussians!They must have learned of
it by this time.Listen, it is so far, and yet we can hear!_The peasant laughs hoarsely._

MAURICE

Sit down, right here, the automobile is large.CHAUFFEUR

_Muttering._

Sit down, sit down!DOCTOR

_Uneasily._

What is it?MAURICE

What an unfortunate mishap!JEANNE

_Agitated._

They shot you like a rabbit?Do you hear, Emil--they thought a
rabbit was running!_She laughs loudly, the peasant also laughs._

PEASANT

I look like a rabbit!JEANNE

Do you hear, Emil?_Laughs._

EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne!JEANNE

It makes me laugh--it seems so comical to me that they mistake
us for rabbits.And now, what are we now--water rats?Emil, just
picture to yourself, water rats in an automobile!JEANNE

No, no, I am not laughing any more, Maurice!_Laughs._

And what else are we?PEASANT

_Laughs._

And now we must hide in the ground--

JEANNE

_In the same tone._

And they will remain on the ground?EMIL GRELIEU

My dear!MAURICE

_To the doctor._

Listen, you must do something.Mamma, we are starting directly, my dear!JEANNE

No, never mind, I am not laughing any more.Maurice, I simply felt like talking.I
was forever silent, but just now I felt like chattering.Emil,
I am not disturbing you with my talk, am I?Why is the water so
quiet, Emil?It was the King who said, "The water is silent,"
was it not?But I should like to see it roar, crash like
thunder.... No, I cannot, I cannot bear this silence!Ah, why is
it so quiet--I cannot bear it!MAURICE

_To the chauffeur._

My dear fellow, please hurry up!CHAUFFEUR

Yes, yes!JEANNE

_Suddenly cries, threatening._

But I cannot bear it!_Covers her mouth with her hands; sobs._

I cannot!EMIL GRELIEU

All will end well, Jeanne.JEANNE

_Sobbing, but calming herself somewhat._

I cannot bear it!EMIL GRELIEU

All will end well, Jeanne!I am suffering, but I know this, Jeanne!CHAUFFEUR

In a moment, in a moment.EMIL GRELIEU

_Faintly._

Jeanne!JEANNE

Yes, yes, I know.... Forgive me, forgive me, I will soon--

_A loud, somewhat hoarse voice of a girl comes from the dark._

GIRL

Tell me how I can find my way to Lonua!_Exclamations of surprise._

MAURICE

Who is that?JEANNE

Emil, it is that girl!_Laughs._

She is also like a rabbit!DOCTOR

_Grumbles._

What is it, what is it--Who?Her dress is torn, her eyes look
wild.The peasant is laughing._

PEASANT

She is here again?CHAUFFEUR

Let me have the light!GIRL

_Loudly._

How can I find my way to Lonua?EMIL GRELIEU

Maurice, you must stop her!Doctor, you--

CHAUFFEUR

Put down the lantern!GIRL

_Shouts._

Hands off!No, no, you will not dare--

MAURICE

You can't catch her--

_The girl runs away._

EMIL GRELIEU

Doctor, you must catch her!She will perish here, quick--

_She runs away.The doctor follows her in the dark._

PEASANT

She asked me, too, how to go to Lonua._The girl's voice resounds in the dark and then there is
silence._

EMIL GRELIEU

You must catch her!MAURICE

But how, father?Jeanne
breaks into muffled laughter._

MAURICE

_Mutters._

Now he is gone!CHAUFFEUR

_Triumphantly._

Take your seats!MAURICE

But the doctor isn't here.CHAUFFEUR

Let us call him._Maurice and the chauffeur call: "Doctor!"_

CHAUFFEUR

_Angrily._

I must deliver Monsieur Grelieu, and I will deliver him.MAURICE

_Shouts._

Langloi!_A faint echo in the distance._

Come!_The response is nearer._

PEASANT

He did not catch her.She asked me, too,
about the road to Lonua._Laughs._

There are many like her now.EMIL GRELIEU

_Imploringly._

Jeanne!JEANNE

But I cannot, Emil.I used
to understand, I used to understand, but now--Where is Pierre?_Firmly._

Where is Pierre?MAURICE

Oh, will he be here soon?Mother dear, we'll start in a moment!JEANNE

Yes, yes, we'll start in a moment!Why such a dream, why such a dream?_A mice from the darkness, quite near._

JEANNE

_Frightened._

Who is shouting?What a strange dream, what a terrible,
terrible, terrible dream._Lowering her voice._

I cannot--why are you torturing me?EMIL GRELIEU

He is dead, Jeanne!EMIL GRELIEU

He is dead, Jeanne.But I swear to you by God, Jeanne!--Belgium
will live.Weep, sob, you are a mother.I too am crying with
you--But I swear by God: Belgium will live!God has given me the
light to see, and I can see.A new Spring will come here, the trees will be covered with
blossoms--I swear to you, Jeanne, they will be covered with
blossoms!And mothers will caress their children, and the sun
will shine upon their heads, upon their golden-haired little
heads!I see my nation: Here it is advancing with palm
leaves to meet God who has come to earth again.Weep, Jeanne,
you are a mother!Weep, unfortunate mother--God weeps with you.But there will be happy mothers here again--I see a new world,
Jeanne, I see a new life!To-day
the natives of Yucatan wear the same dress, with but slight
modifications.While the aborigines of the _Tierra de Guerra_, who still
preserve the customs of their forefathers, untainted by foreign
admixture, use the same garments, of their own manufacture, that we see
represented in the bas-reliefs of Chichen and Uxmal, and in the mural
paintings of _Mayab_ and Egypt.Divination by the inspection of the entrails of victims, and the study
of omens were considered by the Egyptians as important branches of
learning.The soothsayers formed a respected order of the priesthood.From the mural paintings at Chichen, and from the works of the
chroniclers, we learn that the Mayas also had several manners of
consulting fate.One of the modes was by the inspection of the entrails
of victims; another by the manner of the cracking of the shell of a
turtle or armadillo by the action of fire, as among the Chinese.(In the
_Hong-fan_ or "the great and sublime doctrine," one of the books of the
_Chou-king_, the ceremonies of _Pou_ and _Chi_ are described at length).The Mayas had also their astrologers and prophets.Several prophecies,
purporting to have been made by their priests, concerning the preaching
of the Gospel among the people of Mayab, have reached us, preserved in
the works of Landa, Lizana, and Cogolludo.There we also read that, even
at the time of the Spanish conquest, they came from all parts of the
country, and congregated at the shrine of _Kinich-kakmo_, the deified
daughter of CAN, to listen to the oracles delivered by her through the
mouths of her priests and consult her on future events.By the
examination of the mural paintings, we know that _animal magnetism_ was
understood and practiced by the priests, who, themselves, seem to have
consulted clairvoyants.The learned priests of Egypt are said to have made considerable progress
in astronomical sciences.The _gnomon_, discovered by me in December, last year, in the ruined
city of Mayapan, would tend to prove that the learned men of Mayab were
not only close observers of the march of the celestial bodies and good
mathematicians; but that their attainments in astronomy were not
inferior to those of their brethren of Chaldea.Effectively the
construction of the gnomon shows that they had found the means of
calculating the latitude of places, that they knew the distance of the
solsticeal points from the equator; they had found that the greatest
angle of declination of the sun, 23 deg.27', occurred when that
luminary reached the tropics where, during nearly three days, said angle
of declination does not vary, for which reason they said that the _sun_
had arrived at his resting place.The Egyptians, it is said, in very remote ages, divided the year by
lunations, as the Mayas, who divided their civil year into eighteen
months, of twenty days, that they called U--moon--to which they added
five supplementary days, that they considered unlucky.From an epoch so
ancient that it is referred to the fabulous time of their history, the
Egyptians adopted the solar year, dividing it into twelve months, of
thirty days, to which they added, at the end of the last month, called
_Mesore_, five days, named _Epact_.By a most remarkable coincidence, the Egyptians, as the Mayas,
considered these additive five days _unlucky_.Besides this solar year they had a sideral or sothic year, composed of
365 days and 6 hours, which corresponds exactly to the Mayas[TN-25]
sacred year, that Landa tells us was also composed of 365 days and 6
hours; which they represented in the gnomon of Mayapan by the line that
joins the centers of the stela that forms it.The Egyptians, in their computations, calculated by a system of _fives_
and _tens_; the Mayas by a system of _fives_ and _twenties_, to four
hundred.Their sacred number appears to have been 13 from the remotest
antiquity, but SEVEN seems to have been a _mystic number_ among them as
among the Hindoos, Aryans, Chaldeans, Egyptians, and other nations.The Egyptians made use of a septenary system in the arrangement of the
grand gallery in the center of the great pyramid.Each side of the wall
is made of seven courses of finely polished stones, the one above
overlapping that below, thus forming the triangular ceiling common to
all the edifices in Yucatan.This gallery is said to be seven times the
height of the other passages, and, as all the rooms in Uxmal, Chichen
and other places in Mayab, it is seven-sided.Some authors pretend to
assume that this well marked septenary system has reference to the
_Pleiades_ or _Seven stars_._Alcyone_, the central star of the group,
being, it is said, on the same meridian as the pyramid, when it was
constructed, and _Alpha_ of Draconis, the then pole star, at its lower
culmination.Joseph A. Seiss and others pretend, the scientific
attainments required for the construction of such enduring monument
surpassed those of the learned men of Egypt, we must, of necessity,
believe that the architect who conceived the plan and carried out its
designs must have acquired his knowledge from an older people,
possessing greater learning than the priests of Memphis; unless we try
to persuade ourselves, as the reverend gentleman wishes us to, that the
great pyramid was built under the direct inspiration of the Almighty.Nearly all the monuments of Yucatan bear evidence that the Mayas had a
predilection for number SEVEN.Since we find that their artificial
mounds were composed of seven superposed platforms; that the city of
Uxmal contained seven of these mounds; that the north side of the palace
of King CAN was adorned with seven turrets; that the entwined serpents,
his totem, which adorn the east facade of the west wing of this
building, have seven rattles; that the head-dress of kings and queens
were adorned with seven blue feathers; in a word, that the number SEVEN
prevails in all places and in everything where Maya influence has
predominated.It is a FACT, and one that may not be altogether devoid of significance,
that this number SEVEN seems to have been the mystic number of many of
the nations of antiquity.It has even reached our times as such, being
used as symbol[TN-26] by several of the secret societies existing among
us.If we look back through the vista of ages to the dawn of civilized life
in the countries known as the _old world_, we find this number SEVEN
among the Asiatic nations as well as in Egypt and Mayab.Effectively, in
Babylon, the celebrated temple of _the seven lights_ was made of _seven_
stages or platforms.In the hierarchy of Mazdeism, the _seven marouts_,
or genii of the winds, the _seven amschaspands_; then among the Aryans
and their descendants, the _seven horses_ that drew the chariot of the
sun, the _seven apris_ or shape of the flame, the _seven rays_ of Agni,
the _seven manons_ or criators of the Vedas; among the Hebrews, the
_seven days_ of the creation, the _seven lamps_ of the ark and of
Zacharias's vision, the _seven branches_ of the golden candlestick, the
_seven days_ of the feast of the dedication of the temple of Solomon,
the _seven years_ of plenty, the _seven years_ of famine; in the
Christian dispensation, the _seven_ churches with the _seven_ angels at
their head, the _seven_ golden candlesticks, the _seven seals_ of the
book, the _seven_ trumpets of the angels, the _seven heads_ of the beast
that rose from the sea, the _seven vials_ full of the wrath of God, the
_seven_ last plagues of the Apocalypse; in the Greek mythology, the
_seven_ heads of the hydra, killed by Hercules, etc.The origin of the prevalence of that number SEVEN amongst all the
nations of earth, even the most remote from each other, has never been
satisfactorily explained, each separate people giving it a different
interpretation, according to their belief and to the tenets of their
religious creeds.As far as the Mayas are concerned, I think to have
found that it originated with the _seven_ members of CAN'S family, who
were the founders of the principal cities of _Mayab_, and to each of
whom was dedicated a mound in Uxmal and a turret in their palace.Their
names, according to the inscriptions carved on the monuments raised by
them at Uxmal and Chichen, were--CAN (serpent) and [C]OZ (bat), his
wife, from whom were born CAY (fish), the pontiff; AAK (turtle), who
became the governor of Uxmal; CHAACMOL (leopard), the warrior, who
became the husband of his sister MOO (macaw), the Queen of _Chichen_,
worshiped after her death at Izamal; and NICTE (flower), the priestess
who, under the name of _Zuhuy-Kuk_, became the goddess of the maidens.The Egyptians, in expressing their ideas in writing, used three
different kinds of characters--phonetic, ideographic and
symbolic--placed either in vertical columns or in horizontal lines, to
be read from right to left, from left to right, as indicated by the
position of the figures of men or animals.So, also, the Mayas in their
writings employed phonetic, symbolic and ideographic signs, combining
these often, forming monograms as we do to-day, placing them in such a
manner as best suited the arrangement of the ornamentation of the facade
of the edifices.At present we can only speak with certainty of the
monumental inscriptions, the books that fell in the hands of the
ecclesiastics at the time of the conquest having been destroyed.No
truly genuine written monuments of the Mayas are known to exist, except
those inclosed within the sealed apartments, where the priests and
learned men of MAYAB hid them from the _Nahualt_ or _Toltec_ invaders.As the Egyptians, they wrote in vertical columns and horizontal lines,
to be read generally from right to left.The space of this small essay
does not allow me to enter in more details; they belong naturally to a
work of different nature.Let it therefore suffice, for the present
purpose, to state that the comparative study of the language of the
Mayas led us to suspect that, as it contains words belonging to nearly
all the known languages of antiquity, and with exactly the same meaning,
in their mode of writing might be found letters or characters or signs
used in those tongues.Studying with attention the photographs made by
us of the inscriptions of Uxmal and Chichen, we were not long in
discovering that our surmises were indeed correct.The inscriptions,
written in squares or parallelograms, that might well have served as
models for the ancient hieratic Chaldeans, of the time of King Uruck,
seem to contain ancient Chaldee, Egyptian and Etruscan characters,
together with others that seem to be purely Mayab.Applying these known characters to the decipherment of the inscriptions,
giving them their accepted value, we soon found that the language in
which they are written is, in the main, the vernacular of the aborigines
of Yucatan and other parts of Central America to-day.Of course, the
original mother tongue having suffered some alterations, in consequence
of changes in customs induced by time, invasions, intercourse with other
nations, and the many other natural causes that are known to affect
man's speech.The Mayas and the Egyptians had many signs and characters identical;
possessing the same alphabetical and symbolical value in both nations.Among the symbolical, I may cite a few: _water_, _country or region_,
_king_, _Lord_, _offerings_, _splendor_, the _various emblems of the
sun_ and many others.Among the alphabetical, a very large number of the
so-called Demotic, by Egyptologists, are found even in the inscription
of the _Akab[c]ib_ at Chichen; and not a few of the most ancient
Egyptian hieroglyphs in the mural inscriptions at Uxmal.In these I have
been able to discover the Egyptian characters corresponding to our own.A a, B, C, CH or K, D, T, I, L, M, N, H, P, TZ, PP, U, OO, X, having the
same sound and value as in the Spanish language, with the exception of
the K, TZ, PP and X, which are pronounced in a way peculiar to the
Mayas.The inscriptions also contain these letters, A, I, X and PP
identical to the corresponding in the Etruscan alphabet.The finding of
the value of these characters has enabled me to decipher, among other
things, the names of the founders of the city of UXMAL; as that of the
city itself.This is written apparently in two different ways: whilst,
in fact, the sculptors have simply made use of two homophone signs,
notwithstanding dissimilar, of the letter M. As to the name of the
founders, not only are they written in alphabetical characters, but also
in ideographic, since they are accompanied in many instances by the
totems of the personages: e. g[TN-27] for AAK, which means turtle, is the
image of a turtle; for CAY (fish), the image of a fish; for Chaacmol
(leopard) the image of a leopard; and so on, precluding the possibility
of misinterpretation.Having found that the language of the inscriptions was Maya, of course
I had no difficulty in giving to each letter its proper phonetic value,
since, as I have already said, Maya is still the vernacular of the
people.I consider that the few facts brought together will suffice at present
to show, if nothing else, a strange similarity in the workings of the
mind in these two nations.But if these remarkable coincidences are not
merely freaks of hazard, we will be compelled to admit that one people
must have learned it from the other.Then will naturally arise the
questions, Which the teacher?The answer will not only
solve an ethnological problem, but decide the question of priority.I will now briefly refer to the myth of Osiris, the son of _Seb and
Nut_, the brother of _Aroeris_, the elder _Horus_, of _Typho_, of
_Isis_, and of _Nephthis_, named also NIKE.The authors have given
numerous explanations, result of fancy; of the mythological history of
that god, famous throughout Egypt.They made him a personification of
the inundations of the NILE; ISIS, his wife and sister, that of the
irrigated portion of the land of Egypt; their sister, _Nephthis_, that
of the barren edge of the desert occasionally fertilized by the waters
of the Nile; his brother and murderer _Tipho_, that of the sea which
swallows up the _Nile_.Leaving aside the mythical lores, with which the priests of all times
and all countries cajole the credulity of ignorant and superstitious
people, we find that among the traditions of the past, treasured in the
mysterious recesses of the temples, is a history of the life of Osiris
on Earth.Many wise men of our days have looked upon it as fabulous.I
am not ready to say whether it is or it is not; but this I can assert,
that, in many parts, it tallies marvelously with that of the culture
hero of the Mayas.It will be said, no doubt, that this remarkable similarity is a mere
coincidence.But how are we to dispose of so many coincidences?What
conclusion, if any, are we to draw from this concourse of so many
strange similes?In this case, I cannot do better than to quote, verbatim, from Sir
Gardner Wilkinson's work, chap.xiii:

     "_Osiris_, having become King of Egypt, applied himself towards
     civilizing his countrymen, by turning them from their former
     barbarous course of life, teaching them, moreover, to cultivate and
     improve the fruits of the earth.* * * * * With the same good
     disposition, he afterwards traveled over the rest of the world,
     inducing the people everywhere to submit to his discipline, by the
     mildest persuasion."The rest of the story relates to the manner of his killing by his
brother Typho, the disposal of his remains, the search instituted by his
wife to recover the body, how it was stolen again from her by _Typho_,
who cut him to pieces, scattering them over the earth, of the final
defeat of Typho by Osiris's son, Horus.Reading the description, above quoted, of the endeavors of Osiris to
civilize the world, who would not imagine to be perusing the traditions
of the deeds of the culture heroes _Kukulean_[TN-28] and Quetzalcoatl of
the Mayas and of the Aztecs?Osiris was particularly worshiped at Philo,
where the history of his life is curiously illustrated in the sculptures
of a small retired chamber, lying nearly over the western adytum of the
temple, just as that of Chaacmol in the mural paintings of his funeral
chamber, the bas-reliefs of what once was his mausoleum, in those of the
queen's chamber and of her box in the tennis court at Chichen."The mysteries of Osiris were divided into the greater and less
     mysteries.Before admission into the former, it was necessary that
     the initiated should have passed through all the gradations of the
     latter.But to merit this great honor, much was expected of the
     candidate, and many even of the priesthood were unable to obtain
     it.Besides the proofs of a virtuous life, other recommendations
     were required, and to be admitted to all the grades of the higher
     mysteries was the greatest honor to which any one could aspire.It
     was from these that the mysteries of Eleusis were borrowed."In Mayab there also existed mysteries, as proved by symbols discovered
in the month of June last by myself in the monument generally called the
_Dwarf's House_, at Uxmal.It seemed that the initiated had to pass
through different gradations to reach the highest or third; if we are to
judge by the number of rooms dedicated to their performance, and the
disposition of said rooms.The strangest part, perhaps, of this
discovery is the information it gives us that certain signs and symbols
were used by the affiliated, that are perfectly identical to those used
among the masons in their symbolical lodges.I have lately published in
_Harper's Weekly_, a full description of the building, with plans of the
same, and drawings of the signs and symbols existing in it.These secret
societies exist still among the _Zunis_ and other Pueblo Indians of New
Mexico, according to the relations of Mr.Frank H. Cushing, a gentleman
sent by the Smithsonian Institution to investigate their customs and
history.In order to comply with the mission intrusted to him, Mr.Cushing has caused his adoption in the tribe of the Zunis, whose
language he has learned, whose habits he has adopted.Among the other
remarkable things he has discovered is "the existence of twelve sacred
orders, with their priests and their secret rites as carefully guarded
as the secrets of freemasonry, an institution to which these orders have
a strange resemblance."If from Egypt we pass to Nubia, we find that the peculiar battle ax of
the Mayas was also used by the warriors of that country; whilst many of
the customs of the inhabitants of equatorial Africa, as described by Mr.DuChaillu[TN-29] in the relation of his voyage to the "Land of Ashango,"
so closely resemble those of the aborigines of Yucatan as to suggest
that intimate relations must have existed, in very remote ages, between
their ancestors; if the admixture of African blood, clearly discernible
still, among the natives of certain districts of the peninsula, did not
place that _fact_ without the peradventure of a doubt.We also see
figures in the mural paintings, at Chichen, with strongly marked African
features.We learned by the discovery of the statue of Chaacmol, and that of the
priestess found by me at the foot of the altar in front of the shrine
of _Ix-cuina_, the Maya Venus, situated at the south end of _Isla
Mugeres_, it was customary with persons of high rank to file their teeth
in sharp points like a saw.We read in the chronicles that this fashion
still prevailed after the Spanish conquest; and then by little and
little fell into disuse.Travelers tells us that it is yet in vogue
among many of the tribes in the interior of South America; particularly
those whose names seem to connect with the ancient Caribs or Carians.Du Chaillu asserts that the Ashangos, those of Otamo, the Apossos, the
Fans, and many other tribes of equatorial Africa, consider it a mark of
beauty to file their front teeth in a sharp point.He presents the Fans
as confirmed cannibals.We are told, and the bas-reliefs on Chaacmol's
mausoleum prove it, that the Mayas devoured the hearts of their fallen
enemies.It is said that, on certain grand occasions, after offering the
hearts of their victims to the idols, they abandoned the bodies to the
people, who feasted upon them.But it must be noticed that these
last-mentioned customs seemed to have been introduced in the country by
the Nahualts and Aztecs; since, as yet, we have found nothing in the
mural paintings to cause us to believe that the Mayas indulged in such
barbaric repasts, beyond the eating of their enemies' hearts.The Mayas were, and their descendants are still, confirmed believers in
witchcraft.In December, last year, being at the hacienda of
X-Kanchacan, where are situated the ruins of the ancient city of
Mayapan, a sick man was brought to me.He came most reluctantly, stating
that he knew what was the matter with him: that he was doomed to die
unless the spell was removed.He was emaciated, seemed to suffer from
malarial fever, then prevalent in the place, and from the presence of
tapeworm.I told him I could restore him to health if he would heed my
advice.The fellow stared at me for some time, trying to find out,
probably, if I was a stronger wizard than the _H-Men_ who had bewitched
him.He must have failed to discover on my face the proverbial
distinctive marks great sorcerers are said to possess; for, with an
incredulous grin, stretching his thin lips tighter over his teeth, he
simply replied: "No use--I am bewitched--there is no remedy for me."Du Chaillu, speaking of the superstitions of the inhabitants of
Equatorial Africa, says: "The greatest curse of the whole country is the
belief in sorcery or witchcraft.If the African is once possessed with
the belief that he is bewitched his whole nature seems to change.He
becomes suspicious of his dearest friends.He fancies himself sick, and
really often becomes sick through his fears.At least seventy-five per
cent of the deaths in all the tribes are murders for supposed sorcery."In that they differ from the natives of Yucatan, who respect wizards
because of their supposed supernatural powers.From the most remote antiquity, as we learn from the writings of the
chroniclers, in all sacred ceremonies the Mayas used to make copious
libations with _Balche_.To-day the aborigines still use it in the
celebrations of their ancient rites._Balche_ is a liquor made from the
bark of a tree called Balche, soaked in water, mixed with honey and left
to ferment.The nectar drank by
the God of Greek Mythology.Du Chaillu, speaking of the recovery to health of the King of _Mayo_lo,
a city in which he resided for some time, says: "Next day he was so much
elated with the improvement in his health that he got tipsy on a
fermented beverage which he had prepared two days before he had fallen
ill, and which he made by _mixing honey and water, and adding to it
pieces of bark of a certain tree_."(Journey to Ashango Land, page 183.)I will remark here that, by a strange _coincidence_, we not only find
that the inhabitants of Equatorial Africa have customs identical with
the MAYAS, but that the name of one of their cities MAYO_lo_, seems to
be a corruption of MAYAB.The Africans make offerings upon the graves of their departed friends,
where they deposit furniture, dress and food--and sometimes slay slaves,
men and women, over the graves of kings and chieftains, with the belief
that their spirits join that of him in whose honor they have been
sacrificed.I have already said that it was customary with the Mayas to place in the
tombs part of the riches of the deceased and the implements of his trade
or profession; and that the great quantity of blood found scattered
round the slab on which the statue of Chaacmol is reclining would tend
to suggest that slaves were sacrificed at his funeral.The Mayas of old were wont to abandon the house where a person had died.Many still observe that same custom when they can afford to do so; for
they believe that the spirit of the departed hovers round it.The Africans also abandon their houses, remove even the site of their
villages when death frequently occur;[TN-30] for, say they, the place is
no longer good; and they fear the spirits of those recently deceased.Among the musical instruments used by the Mayas there were two kinds of
drums--the _Tunkul_ and the _Zacatan_.They are still used by the
aborigines in their religious festivals and dances.The _Tunkul_ is a cylinder hollowed from the trunk of a tree, so as to
leave it about one inch in thickness all round.It is generally about
four feet in length.On one side two slits are cut, so as to leave
between them a strip of about four inches in width, to within six inches
from the ends; this strip is divided in the middle, across, so as to
form, as it were, tongues.It is by striking on those tongues with two
balls of india-rubber, attached to the end of sticks, that the
instrument is played.The volume of sound produced is so great that it
can be heard, is[TN-31] is said, at a distance of six miles in calm
weather.The _Zacatan_ is another sort of drum, also hollowed from the
trunk of a tree.On one end a piece of
skin is tightly stretched.It is by beating on the skin with the hand,
the instrument being supported between the legs of the drummer, in a
slanting position, that it is played.Du Chaillu, Stanley and other travelers in Africa tell us that, in case
of danger and to call the clans together, the big war drum is beaten,
and is heard many miles around.Du Chaillu asserts having seen one of
these _Ngoma_, formed of a hollow log, nine feet long, at Apono; and
describes a _Fan_ drum which corresponds to the _Zacatan_ of the Mayas
as follows: "The cylinder was about four feet long and ten inches in
diameter at one end, but only seven at the other.The wood was hollowed
out quite thin, and the skin stretched over tightly.To beat it the
drummer held it slantingly between his legs, and with two sticks
beats[TN-32] furiously upon the upper, which was the larger end of the
cylinder."We have the counterpart of the fetish houses, containing the skulls of
the ancestors and some idol or other, seen by Du Chaillu, in African
towns, in the small huts constructed at the entrance of all the villages
in Yucatan.These huts or shrines contain invariably a crucifix; at
times the image of some saint, often a skull.The last probably to cause
the wayfarer to remember he has to die; and that, as he cannot carry
with him his worldly treasures on the other side of the grave, he had
better deposit some in the alms box firmly fastened at the foot of the
cross.Cogolludo informs us these little shrines were anciently
dedicated to the god of lovers, of histrions, of dancers, and an
infinity of small idols that were placed at the entrance of the
villages, roads and staircases of the temples and other parts.Even the breed of African dogs seems to be the same as that of the
native dogs of Yucatan.Were I to describe these I could not make use of
more appropriate words than the following of Du Chaillu: "The pure bred
native dog is small, has long straight ears, long muzzle and long curly
tail; the hair is short and the color yellowish; the pure breed being
known by the clearness of his color.They are always lean, and are kept
very short of food by their owners.* * * Although they have quick ears;
I don't think highly of their scent.I could continue this list of similes, but methinks those already
mentioned as sufficient for the present purpose.I will therefore close
it by mentioning this strange belief that Du Chaillu asserts exists
among the African warriors: "_The charmed leopard's skin worn about the
warrior's middle is supposed to render that worthy spear-proof._"

Let us now take a brief retrospective glance at the FACTS mentioned in
the foregoing pages.They seem to teach us that, in ages so remote as to
be well nigh lost in the abyss of the past, the _Mayas_ were a great and
powerful nation, whose people had reached a high degree of civilization.That it is impossible for us to form a correct idea of their
attainments, since only the most enduring monuments, built by them, have
reached us, resisting the disintegrating action of time and atmosphere.That, as the English of to-day, they had colonies all over the earth;
for we find their name, their traditions, their customs and their
language scattered in many distant countries, among whose inhabitants
they apparently exercised considerable civilizing influence, since they
gave names to their gods, to their tribes, to their cities.We cannot doubt that the colonists carried with them the old traditions
of the mother country, and the history of the founders of their
nationality; since we find them in the countries where they seem to have
established large settlements soon after leaving the land of their
birth.In course of time these traditions have become disfigured,
wrapped, as it were, in myths, creations of fanciful and untutored
imaginations, as in Hindostan: or devises of crafty priests, striving to
hide the truth from the ignorant mass of the people, fostering their
superstitions, in order to preserve unbounded and undisputed sway over
them, as in Egypt.In Hindostan, for example, we find the Maya custom of carrying the
children astride on the hips of the nurses.That of recording the vow of
the devotees, or of imploring the blessings of deity by the imprint of
the hand, dipped in red liquid, stamped on the walls of the shrines and
palaces.The worship of the mastodon, still extant in India, Siam,
Burmah, as in the worship of _Ganeza_, the god of knowledge, with an
elephant head, degenerated in that of the elephant itself.Still extant we find likewise the innate propensity of the Mayas to
exclude all foreigners from their country; even to put to death those
who enter their territories (as do, even to-day, those of Santa Cruz and
the inhabitants of the Tierra de Guerra) as the emissaries of Rama were
informed by the friend of the owner of the country, the widow of the
_great architect_, MAYA, whose name HEMA means in the Maya language "she
who places ropes across the roads to impede the passage."Even the
history of the death of her husband MAYA, killed with a thunderbolt, by
the god _Pourandara_, whose jealousy was aroused by his love for her and
their marriage, recalls that of _Chaacmol_, the husband of _Moo_, killed
by their brother Aac, by being stabbed by him three times in the back
with a spear, through jealousy--for he also loved _Moo_.Some Maya tribes, after a time, probably left their home at the South of
Hindostan and emigrated to Afghanistan, where their descendants still
live and have villages on the North banks of the river _Kabul_.They
left behind old traditions, that they may have considered as mere
fantasies of their poets, and other customs of their forefathers.Yet we
know so little about the ancient Afghans, or the Maya tribes living
among them, that it is impossible at present to say how much, if any,
they have preserved of the traditions of their race.All we know for a
certainty is that many of the names of their villages and tribes are
pure American-Maya words: that their types are very similar to the
features of the bearded men carved on the pillars of the castle, and on
the walls of other edifices at Chichen-Itza: while their warlike habits
recall those of the Mayas, who fought so bravely and tenaciously the
Spanish invaders.Some of the Maya tribes, traveling towards the west and northwest,
reached probably the shores of Ethiopia; while others, entering the
Persian Gulf, landed near the embouchure of the Euphrates, and founded
their primitive capital at a short distance from it.They called it _Hur
(Hula) city of guests just arrived_--and according to Berosus gave
themselves the name of _Khaldi_; probably because they intrenched their
city: _Kal_ meaning intrenchment in the American-Maya language.We have
seen that the names of all the principal deities of the primitive
Chaldeans had a natural etymology in that tongue.Such strange
coincidences cannot be said to be altogether accidental.Particularly
when we consider that their learned men were designated as MAGI, (Mayas)
and their Chief _Rab-Mag_, meaning, in Maya, the _old man_; and were
great architects, mathematicians and astronomers.As again we know of
them but imperfectly, we cannot tell what traditions they had preserved
of the birthplace of their forefathers.But by the inscriptions on the
tablets or bricks, found at Mugheir and Warka, we know for a certainty
that, in the archaic writings, they formed their characters of straight
lines of uniform thickness; and inclosed their sentences in squares or
parallelograms, as did the founders of the ruined cities of Yucatan.And
from the signet cylinder of King Urukh, that their mode of dressing was
identical with that of many personages represented in the mural
paintings at Chichen-Itza.We have traced the MAYAS again on the shores of Asia Minor, where the
CARIANS at last established themselves, after having spread terror among
the populations bordering on the Mediterranean.Their origin is unknown:
but their customs were so similar to those of the inhabitants of Yucatan
at the time even of the Spanish conquest--and their names CAR, _Carib_
or _Carians_, so extensively spread over the western continent, that we
might well surmise, that, navigators as they were, they came from those
parts of the world; particularly when we are told by the Greek poets and
historians, that the goddess MAIA was the daughter of _Atlantis_.We
have seen that the names of the khati, those of their cities, that of
Tyre, and finally that of Egypt, have their etymology in the Maya.Considering the numerous coincidences already pointed out, and many more
I could bring forth, between the attainments and customs of the Mayas
and the Egyptians; in view also of the fact that the priests and learned
men of Egypt constantly pointed toward the WEST as the birthplace of
their ancestors, it would seem as if a colony, starting from Mayab, had
emigrated Eastward, and settled on the banks of the Nile; just as the
Chinese to-day, quitting their native land and traveling toward the
rising sun, establish themselves in America.In Egypt again, as in Hindostan, we find the history of the children of
CAN, preserved among the secret traditions treasured up by the priests
in the dark recesses of their temples: the same story, even with all its
details.It is TYPHO who kills his brother OSIRIS, the husband of their
sister ISIS.Some of the names only have been changed when the members
of the royal family of CAN, the founder of the cities of Mayab, reaching
apotheosis, were presented to the people as gods, to be worshiped.That the story of _Isis_ and _Osiris_ is a mythical account of CHAACMOL
and MOO, from all the circumstances connected with it, according to the
relations of the priests of Egypt that tally so closely with what we
learn in Chichen-Itza from the bas-reliefs, it seems impossible to
doubt.Effectively, _Osiris_ and _Isis_ are considered as king and queen of the
Amenti--the region of the West--the mansion of the dead, of the
ancestors.Whatever may be the etymology of the name of Osiris, it is a
_fact_, that in the sculptures he is often represented with a spotted
skin suspended near him, and Diodorus Siculus says: "That the skin is
usually represented without the head; but some instances where this is
introduced show it to be the _leopard's_ or _panther's_."Again, the
name of Osiris as king of the West, of the Amenti, is always written, in
hieroglyphic characters, representing a crouching _leopard_ with an eye
above it.It is also well known that the priests of Osiris wore a
_leopard_ skin as their ceremonial dress.Now, Chaacmol reigned with his sister Moo, at Chichen-Itza, in Mayab, in
the land of the West for Egypt.The name _Chaacmol_ means, in Maya, a
_Spotted_ tiger, a _leopard_; and he is represented as such in all his
totems in the sculptures on the monuments; his shield being made of the
skin of leopard, as seen in the mural paintings.Osiris, in Egypt, is a myth.Chaacmol, in Mayab, a reality.A warrior
whose mausoleum I have opened; whose weapons and ornaments of jade are
in Mrs.Le Plongeon's possession; whose heart I have found, and sent a
piece of it to be analysed by professor Thompson of Worcester, Mass.;
whose effigy, with his name inscribed on the tablets occupying the place
of the ears, forms now one of the most precious relics in the National
Museum of Mexico.As to the etymology of her name
the Maya affords it in I[C]IN--_the younger sister_.As Queen of the
Amenti, of the West, she also is represented in hieroglyphs by the same
characters as her husband--a _leopard, with an eye above_, and the sign
of the feminine gender an oval or egg.But as a goddess she is always
portrayed with wings; the vulture being dedicated to her; and, as it
were, her totem.MOO the wife and sister of _Chaacmol_ was the Queen of Chichen.She is
represented on the Mausoleum of Chaacmol as a _Macaw_ (Moo in the Maya
language); also on the monuments at Uxmal: and the chroniclers tell us
that she was worshiped in Izamal under the name of _Kinich-Kakmo_;
reading from right to left the _fiery macaw with eyes like the sun_.Their protecting spirit is a _Serpent_, the totem of their father CAN.Another Egyptian divinity, _Apap_ or _Apop_, is represented under the
form of a gigantic serpent covered with wounds.Plutarch in his
treatise, _De Iside et Osiride_, tells us that he was enemy to the sun.TYPHO was the brother of Osiris and Isis; for jealousy, and to usurp the
throne, he formed a conspiration and killed his brother.He is said to
represent in the Egyptian mythology, the sea, by some; by others, _the
sun_.AAK (turtle) was also the brother of Chaacmol and _Moo_.For jealousy,
and to usurp the throne, he killed his brother at treason with three
thrusts of his _spear_ in the back.Around the belt of his statue at
Uxmal used to be seen hanging the heads of his brothers CAY and
CHAACMOL, together with that of MOO; whilst his feet rested on their
flayed bodies.In the sculpture he is pictured surrounded by the _Sun_
as his protecting spirit.The escutcheon of Uxmal shows that he called
the place he governed the land of the Sun.In the bas-reliefs of the
Queen's chamber at Chichen his followers are seen to render homage to
the _Sun_; others, the friends of MOO, to the _Serpent_.So, in Mayab as
in Egypt, the _Sun_ and _Serpent_ were inimical.In Egypt again this
enmity was a myth, in Mayab a reality.AROERIS was the brother of Osiris, Isis and Typho.His business seems to
have been that of a peace-maker.CAY was also the brother of _Chaacmol_, _Moo_ and _Aac_.He was the high
pontiff, and sided with Chaacmol and Moo in their troubles, as we learn
from the mural paintings, from his head and flayed body serving as
trophy to Aac as I have just said.In June last, among the ruins of _Uxmal_, I discovered a magnificent
bust of this personage; and I believe I know the place where his remains
are concealed.NEPHTHIS was the sister of Isis, Osiris, Typho, and Aroeris, and the
wife of Typho; but being in love with Osiris she managed to be taken to
his embraces, and she became pregnant.That intrigue having been
discovered by Isis, she adopted the child that Nephthis, fearing the
anger of her husband, had hidden, brought him up as her own under the
name of Anubis.Nephthis was also called NIKE by some.NIC or NICTE was the sister of _Chaacmol_, _Moo_, _Aac_, and _Cay_, with
whose name I find always her name associated in the sculptures on the
monuments.Here the analogy between these personages would seem to
differ, still further study of the inscriptions may yet prove the
Egyptian version to contain some truth._Nic_ or _Nicte_[TN-33] means
flower; a cast of her face, with a flower sculptured on one cheek,
exists among my collections.We are told that three children were born to Isis and Osiris: Horus,
Macedo, and Harpocrates.Well, in the scene painted on the walls of
Chaacmol's funeral chamber, in which the body of this warrior is
represented stretched on the ground, cut open under the ribs for the
extraction of the heart and visceras, he is seen surrounded by his wife,
his sister NIC, his mother _Zo[c]_, and four children.I will close these similes by mentioning that _Thoth_ was reputed the
preceptor of Isis; and said to be the inventor of letters, of the art of
reckoning, geometry, astronomy, and is represented in the hieroglyphs
under the form of a baboon (cynocephalus).He is one of the most ancient
divinities among the Egyptians.He had also the office of scribe in the
lower regions, where he was engaged in noting down the actions of the
dead, and presenting or reading them to Osiris.One of the modes of
writing his name in hieroglyphs, transcribed in our common letters,
reads _Nukta_; a word most appropriate and suggestive of his attributes,
since, according to the Maya language, it would signify to understand,
to perceive, _Nuctah_: while his name Thoth, maya[TN-34] _thot_ means to
scatter flowers; hence knowledge.In the temple of death at Uxmal, at
the foot of the grand staircase that led to the sanctuary, at the top of
which I found a sacrificial altar, there were six cynocephali in a
sitting posture, as Thoth is represented by the Egyptians.They were
placed three in a row each side of the stairs.Between them was a
platform where a skeleton, in a kneeling posture, used to be.To-day the
cynocephali have been removed.They are in one of the yard[TN-35] of the
principal house at the Hacienda of Uxmal.The statue representing the
kneeling skeleton lays, much defaced, where it stood when that ancient
city was in its glory.In the mural paintings at Chichen-Itza, we again find the baboon
(Cynocephalus) warning Moo of impending danger.She is pictured in her
home, which is situated in the midst of a garden, and over which is seen
the royal insignia.A basket, painted blue, full of bright oranges, is
symbolical of her domestic happiness.Before
her is an individual pictured physically deformed, to show the ugliness
of his character and by the flatness of his skull, want of moral
qualities, (the[TN-36] proving that the learned men of Mayab understood
phrenology).He is in an persuasive attitude; for he has come to try to
seduce her in the name of another.She rejects his offer: and, with her
extended hand, protects the armadillo, on whose shell the high priest
read her destiny when yet a child.In a tree, just above the head of the
man, is an ape.His hand is open and outstretched, both in a warning and
threatening position.A serpent (_can_), her protecting spirit, is seen
at a short distance coiled, ready to spring in her defense.Near by is
another serpent, entwined round the trunk of a tree.He has wounded
about the head another animal, that, with its mouth open, its tongue
protruding, looks at its enemy over its shoulder.Blood is seen oozing
from its tongue and face.This picture forcibly recalls to the mind the
myth of the garden of Eden.For here we have the garden, the fruit, the
woman, the tempter.As to the charmed _leopard_ skin worn by the African warriors to render
them invulnerable to spears, it would seem as if the manner in which
Chaacmol met his death, by being stabbed with a spear, had been known
to their ancestors; and that they, in their superstitious fancies, had
imagined that by wearing his totem, it would save them from being
wounded with the same kind of weapon used in killing him.Let us not
laugh at such a singular conceit among uncivilized tribes, for it still
prevails in Europe.On many of the French and German soldiers, killed
during the last German war, were found talismans composed of strips of
paper, parchment or cloth, on which were written supposed cabalistic
words or the name of some saint, that the wearer firmly believed to be
possessed of the power of making him invulnerable.I am acquainted with many people--and not ignorant--who believe that by
wearing on their persons rosaries, made in Jerusalem and blessed by the
Pope, they enjoy immunity from thunderbolts, plagues, epidemics and
other misfortunes to which human flesh is heir.That the Mayas were a race autochthon on this western continent and did
not receive their civilization from Asia or Africa, seems a rational
conclusion, to be deduced from the foregoing FACTS.If we had nothing
but their _name_ to prove it, it should be sufficient, since its
etymology is only to be found in the American Maya language.They cannot be said to have been natives of Hindostan; since we are told
that, in very remote ages, _Maya_, a prince of the Davanas, established
himself there.We do not find the etymology of his name in any book
where mention is made of it.We are merely told that he was a wise
magician, a great architect, a learned astronomer, a powerful Asoura
(demon), thirsting for battles and bloodshed: or, according to the
Sanscrit, a Goddess, the mother of all beings that exist--gods and men.Very little is known of the Mayas of Afghanistan, except that they call
themselves _Mayas_, and that the names of their tribes and cities are
words belonging to the American Maya language.Who can give the etymology of the name _Magi_, the learned men amongst
the Chaldees.We only know that its meaning is the same as _Maya_ in
Hindostan: magician, astronomer, learned man.If we come to Greece,
where we find again the name _Maia_, it is mentioned as that of a
goddess, as in Hindostan, the mother of the gods: only we are told that
she was the daughter of Atlantis--born of Atlantis.But if we come to
the lands beyond the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, then we find a
country called MAYAB, on account of the porosity of its soil; that, as a
sieve (_Mayab_), absorbs the water in an incredibly short time.Its
inhabitants took its name from that of the country, and called
themselves _Mayas_.It is a fact worthy of notice, that in their
hieroglyphic writings the sign employed by the Egyptians to signify a
_Lord_, a _Master_, was the image of a sieve.Would not this seem to
indicate that the western invaders who subdued the primitive inhabitants
of the valley of the Nile, and became the lords and masters of the land,
were people from MAYAB; particularly if we consider that the usual
character used to write the name of Egypt was the sieve, together with
the sign of land?We know that the _Mayas_ deified and paid divine honors to their eminent
men and women after their death.This worship of their heroes they
undoubtedly carried, with other customs, to the countries where they
emigrated; and, in due course of time, established it among their
inhabitants, who came to forget that MAYAB was a locality, converted it
in to a personalty: and as some of their gods came from it, Maya was
considered as the _Mother of the Gods_, as we see in Hindostan and
Greece.It would seem probable that the Mayas did not receive their civilization
from the inhabitants of the Asiatic peninsulas, for the religious lores
and customs they have in common are too few to justify this assertion.They would simply tend to prove that relations had existed between them
at some epoch or other; and had interchanged some of their habits and
beliefs as it happens, between the civilized nations of our days.This
appears to be the true side of the question; for in the figures
sculptured on the obelisks of Copan the Asiatic type is plainly
discernible; whilst the features of the statues that adorn the
celebrated temples of Hindostan are, beyond all doubts, American.The FACTS gathered from the monuments do not sustain the theory advanced
by many, that the inhabitants of tropical America received their
civilization from Egypt and Asia Minor.It is true that
I have shown that many of the customs and attainments of the Egyptians
were identical to those of the Mayas; but these had many religious rites
and habits unknown to the Egyptians; who, as we know, always pointed
towards the West as the birthplaces of their ancestors, and worshiped as
gods and goddesses personages who had lived, and whose remains are still
in MAYAB.Besides, the monuments themselves prove the respective
antiquity of the two nations.According to the best authorities the most ancient monuments raised by
the Egyptians do not date further back than about 2,500 years B. C.
Well, in Ake, a city about twenty-five miles from Merida, there exists
still a monument sustaining thirty-six columns of _katuns_.Each of
these columns indicate a lapse of one hundred and sixty years in the
life of the nation.They then would show that 5,760 years has intervened
between the time when the first stone was placed on the east corner of
the uppermost of the three immense superposed platforms that compose the
structure, and the placing of the last capping stone on the top of the
thirty-sixth column.How long did that event occur before the Spanish
conquest it is impossible to surmise.Supposing, however, it did take
place at that time; this would give us a lapse of at least 6,100 years
since, among the rejoicings of the people this sacred monument being
finished, the first stone that was to serve as record of the age of the
nation, was laid by the high priest, where we see it to-day.I will
remark that the name AKE is one of the Egyptians' divinities, the third
person of the triad of Esneh; always represented as a child, holding his
finger to his mouth.To-day the meaning of the
word is lost in Yucatan.Cogolludo, in his history of Yucatan, speaking of the manner in which
they computed time, says:

"They counted their ages and eras, which they inscribed in their books
every twenty years, in lustrums of four years.* * * When five of these
lustrums were completed, they called the lapse of twenty years _katun_,
which means to place a stone down upon another.* * * In certain sacred
buildings and in the houses of the priests every twenty years they place
a hewn stone upon those already there.When seven of these stones have
thus been piled one over the other began the _Ahau katun_.Then after
the first lustrum of four years they placed a small stone on the top of
the big one, commencing at the east corner; then after four years more
they placed another small stone on the west corner; then the next at the
north; and the fourth at the south.At the end of the twenty years they
put a big stone on the top of the small ones: and the column, thus
finished, indicated a lapse of one hundred and sixty years."There are other methods for determining the approximate age of the
monuments of Mayab:

1st.By means of their actual orientation; starting from the _fact_ that
their builders always placed either the faces or angles of the edifices
fronting the cardinal points.By determining the epoch when the mastodon became extinct.For,
since _Can_ or his ancestors adopted the head of that animal as symbol
of deity, it is evident they must have known it; hence, must have been
contemporary with it.By determining when, through some great cataclysm, the lands became
separated, and all communications between the inhabitants of _Mayab_ and
their colonies were consequently interrupted.If we are to credit what
Psenophis and Sonchis, priests of Heliopolis and Sais, said to Solon
"that nine thousand years before, the visit to them of the Athenian
legislator, in consequence of great earthquakes and inundations, the
lands of the West disappeared in one day and a fatal night," then we may
be able to form an idea of the antiquity of the ruined cities of America
and their builders.Reader, I have brought before you, without comments, some of the FACTS,
that after ten years of research, the paintings on the walls of
_Chaacmol's_ funeral chamber, the sculptured inscriptions carved on the
stones of the crumbling monuments of Yucatan, and a comparative study of
the vernacular of the aborigines of that country, have revealed to us.Many years of further patient investigations,
the full interpretation of the monumental inscriptions, and, above all,
the possession of the libraries of the learned men of _Mayab_, are the
_sine qua non_ to form an uncontrovertible one, free from the
speculations which invalidate all books published on the subject
heretofore.If by reading these pages you have learned something new, your time has
not been lost; nor mine in writing them.Transcriber's Note

introduced to one amiable specimen of this class in the Eighth Elegy of
the First Book.][Footnote 567: River that hast.--Ver.Ciofanus has this interesting
Note:--'This river is that which flows near the walls of Sulmo, and,
which, at the present day we call 'Vella.'In the early spring, when the
snows melt, and sometimes, at the beginning of autumn, it swells to a
wonderful degree with the rains, so that it becomes quite impassable.Ovid lived not far from the Fountain of Love, at the foot of the
Moronian hill, and had a house there, of which considerable vestiges
still remain, and are called 'la botteghe d'Ovidio.'Wishing to go
thence to the town of Sulmo, where his mistress was living, this river
was an obstruction to his passage.'][Footnote 568: A hollow boat.--Ver.'Cymba' was a name given to
small boats used on rivers or lakes.He here alludes to a ferry-boat,
which was not rowed over; but a chain or rope extending from one side of
the stream to the other, the boatman passed across by running his hands
along the rope.][Footnote 569: The opposite mountain.--Ver.The mountain of Soracte
was near the Flaminian way, in the territory of the Falisci, and may
possibly be the one here alluded to.Ciofanus says that its name is now
'Majella,-and that it is equal in height to the loftiest mountains of
Italy, and capped with eternal snow.He means to say that he has risen early in the morning for the purpose
of proceeding on his journey.][Footnote 570: The son of Danaë.--Ver.Mercury was said to have
lent to Perseus his winged shoes, 'talaria,' when he slew Medusa with
her viperous locks.][Footnote 571: Wish for the chariot.--Ver.Ceres was said to have
sent Trip-tolemus in her chariot, drawn by winged dragons, to introduce
agriculture among mankind.See the Fourth Book of the Fasti, 1.[Footnote 572: Inachus.--Ver.Inachus was a river of Argolis, in
Peloponnesus.][Footnote 573: Love for Melie.--Ver.Melie was a Nymph beloved by
Neptune, to whom she bore Amycus, king of Bebrycia, or Bithynia, in Asia
Minor, whence her present appellation.][Footnote 574: Alpheus.--Ver 29.See the story of Alpheus and Arethusa,
in the Fifth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1.[Footnote 575: Creüsa.--Ver.Creüsa was a Naïad, the mother of
Hypseas, king of the Lapithae, by Peneus, a river of Thessaly.Xanthus
was a rivulet near Troy.Of Creüsa being promised to Xanthus nothing
whatever is known.][Footnote 576: The be beloved by Mars.--Ver.Pindar, in his Sixth
Olympic Ode, says that Metope, the daughter of Ladon, was the mother of
live daughters, by Asopus, a river of Boeotia.Their names were Corcyra,
Ægina, Salamis, Thebe, and Harpinna.Ovid, in calling her Thebe,
probably follows some other writer.She is called 'Martia,' because she
was beloved by Mars, to whom she bore Evadne.][Footnote 577: Hand of Hercules.--Ver.For the contest of Hercules
and Achelous for the hand of Deianira, see the beginning of the Ninth
Book of the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 578: Calydon.--Ver.Aeneus, the father of Meleager and

source or native country of the Nile being then, as it probably still
is, quite unknown.][Footnote 580: Daughter of Asopus.--Ver.Evadne is called
'Asopide,' from her mother being the wife of Asopus.[Footnote 581: Enipeus dried up.--Ver.Probably the true reading
here is 'fictus,' 'the false Enipeus.'Tyro was the daughter of
Salmoneus, king of Pisa, in Elis.She being much enamoured of the river
Enipeus, Neptune is said to have assumed his form, and to have been, by
her, the father of Pelias and Neleus.'][Footnote 582: Argive Tibur,--Ver.Tibur was a town beautifully
situate in the neighbourhood of Home; it was said to have been founded
by three Argive brothers, Tyburtus, Catillus, and Coras.][Footnote 583: Whom Ilia.--Ver.Ilia was said to have been buried
alive, by the orders of Amulius, on the banks of the river Tiber; or,
according to some, to have been thrown into that river, on which she is
said to have become the wife of the river, and was deified.Acron, an
ancient historian, wrote to the effect that her ashes were interred on
the banks of the Anio; and that river overflowing, carried them to
the bed of the Tiber, whence arose the story of her nuptials with the
latter.According to one account, she was not put to death, but was
imprisoned, having been spared by Amulius at the entreaty of his
daughter, who was of the same age as herself, and at length regained her
liberty.][Footnote 584: Descendant of Laomedon.--Ver.She was supposed to
be descended from Laomedon, through Ascanius, the son of Creüsa, the
granddaughter of Laomedon.][Footnote 585: No white fillet.--Ver.The fillet with which the
Vestals bound their hair.][Footnote 586: Am I courted.--Ver.The Vestais were released from
their duties, and were allowed to marry if they chose, after they had

instructing the novices.][Footnote 587: Did she throw herself.--Ver.The Poet follows the
account which represented her as drowning herself.][Footnote 588: To some fixed rule.--Ver.'Legitimum' means
'according to fixed laws so that it might be depended upon, 'in a steady
manner.'][Footnote 589: Injurious to the flocks.--Ver.It would be
'damnosus' in many ways, especially from its sweeping away the cattle
and the produce of the land.Its waters, too, being turbid, would be
unpalatable to the thirsty traveller, and unwholesome from the melted
snow, which would be likely to produce goitre, or swellings in the
throat.][Footnote 590: Could I speak of the rivers.--Ver.He apologizes to
the Acheloüs, Inachus, and Nile, for presuming to mention their names,
in addressing such a turbid, contemptible stream.][Footnote 591: After my poems.--Ver.He refers to his lighter works;
such, perhaps, as the previous books of his Amores.This explains
the nature of the 'libelli,' which he refers to in his address to his
mistress, in the Second Book of the Amores, El.[Footnote 592: His wealth acquired.--Ver.For the
explanation of this word, see the Fasti, B. i.217, and the Note to
the passage.][Footnote 593: Through his wounds.--Ver.In battle, either by giving
wounds, or receiving them.][Footnote 594: Which thus late.--Ver.By 4 serum,'he means that
his position, as a man of respectable station, has only been recently
acquired, and has not descended to him through a long line of
ancestors.][Footnote 595: Was it acquired.--Ver.This was really much to
the merit of his rival; but most of the higher classes of the Romans
affected to despise anything like gain by means of bodily exertion; and
the Poet has extended this feeling even to the rewards of merit as a
soldier.][Footnote 596: Hold sway over.--Ver.He here plays upon the two
meanings of the word 'deducere.''Deducere carmen' is 'to compose
poetry'; 'deducere primum pilum' means 'to form' or 'command the first
troop of the Triarii.'These were the veteran soldiers of the Roman
army, and the 'Primipilus' (which office is here alluded to) being the
first Centurion of the first maniple of them, was the chief Centurion of
the legion, holding an office somewhat similar to our senior captains.See the Note to the
49th line of the Seventh Epistle, in the-Fourth Book of the Pontic
Epistles.][Footnote 597: The ravished damsel.--Ver.[Footnote 598: Resorted to presents.--Ver.He seems to allude to
the real meaning of the story of Danaë, which, no doubt, had reference
to the corrupting influence of money.][Footnote 599: With no boundaries.--Ver.The 'limes' was a line
or boundary, between pieces of land belonging to different persons, and
consisted of a path, or ditch, or a row of stones.The 'ager limitatus'
was the public land marked out by 'limites,' for the purposes of
allotment to the citizens.On apportioning the land, a line, which was
called 'limes,' was drawn through a given point from East to West, which
was called 'decumanus,' and another line was drawn from North to South.The distance at which the 'limites' were to be drawn depended on the
magnitude of the squares or 'centuriæ,' as they were called, into which
it was purposed to divide the tract.][Footnote 601: Then was the shore.--Ver.Because they had not as
yet learnt the art of navigation.][Footnote 602: Turreted fortifications.--Ver.Among the ancients
the fortifications of cities were strengthened by towers, which were
placed at intervals on the walls; they were also generally used at the
gates of towns.][Footnote 603: Why not seek the heavens.--Ver.With what indignation
would he not have spoken of a balloon, as being nothing less than a
downright attempt to scale the 'tertia régna!'][Footnote 604: Ciesar but recently.--Ver.See the end of the
Fifteenth Book of the Metamorphoses, and the Fasti, Book iii.[Footnote 605: The Senate-house.--Ver.'Curia'was the name of the
place where the Senate held its meetings, such as the 'curia Hostilia,'
* Julia,' Marcelli,' and others.Hence arose the custom of calling the
Senate itself, in the various Roman towns, by the name of 'curia,' but
not the Senate of Rome.He here means to say, that poverty excluded a
man from the Senate-house, and that wealth alone was the qualification
for the honours of the state.][Footnote 606: Wealth alone confers honours --Ver.The same
expression occurs in the Fasti, Book i.'217, where a similar
complaint is made on the worldly-mindedness of the age.][Footnote 607: The Field of Mars.--Ver.The 'comitia,' or meetings
for the elections of the magistrates, were held on the 'Campus Martius'
or field of Mars.See the Notes to the Fasti, Book i.The 'Fora' were of two kinds
at Rome; some being market-places, where all kinds of goods were exposed
for sale, while others were solely courts of justice.Among the latter
is the one here mentioned, which was simply called 'Forum,' so long as
it was the only one of its kind existing at Rome, and, indeed, after
that period, as in the present instance.At a later period of the
Republic, and under the Empire, when other 'fora,' for judicial
purposes, were erected, this Forum' was distinguished by the epithets
'vetus,' 'old,' or'magnum, 'great.'It was situate between the
Capitoline and Palatine hills, and was originally a swamp or marsh,
which was filled up hy Romulus or Tatius.It was chiefly used for
judicial proceedings, and is supposed to have been surrounded with
the hankers' shops or offices, 'argentaria.'Gladiatorial games were
occasionally held there, and sometimes prisoners of war, and faithless
legionary soldiers, were there put to death.A second 'Forum,' for
judicial purposes, was erected hy Julius Caesar, and was called hy his
name.It was adorned with a splendid temple of Venus Genitrix.A third
was built hy Augustus, and was called 'Forum Augusts' It was adorned
with a temple of Mars, and the statues of the most distinguished men
of the republic.Having suffered severely from fire, this Forum was
restored by the Emperor Hadrian.It is mentioned in the Fourth Book of
the Pontic Epistles, Ep.[Footnote 609: With regard to me.--Ver.He says that because he is
poor she makes excuses, and pretends that she is afraid of her husband
and those whom he has set to watch her.][Footnote 610: Of thy own inspiration.--Ver.Burmann remarks, that
the word 'opus' is especially applied to the sacred rites of the Gods;
literally 'the priest of thy rites.'][Footnote 611: The erected pile--Ver.Among the Romans the corpse
was burnt on a pile of wood, which was called 'pyra,' or 'rogus.'According to Servius, it was called by the former name before, and hy
the latter after, it was lighted, but this distinction is not observed
by the Latin writers.]It was in the form of an altar with four equal sides, but it varied in
height and the mode of decoration, according to the circumstances of the
deceased.On the pile the body was placed with the couch on which it had
been carried; and frankincense, ointments, locks of hair, and garlands,
were thrown upon it.Even ornaments, clothes, and dishes of food were
sometimes used for the same purpose.This was done not only by the
family of the deceased, but by such persons as joined the funeral
procession.][Footnote 612: The cruel boar.--Ver.He alludes to the death of
Adonis, by the tusk of a boar, which pierced his thigh.See the Tenth
Book of the Metamorphoses, l.[Footnote 613: We possess inspiration.--Ver.In the Sixth Book of
the Fasti, 1.'There is a Deity within us (Poets): under
his guidance we glow with inspiration; this poetic fervour contains the
impregnating.particles of the mind of the Divinity.'][Footnote 614: She lays her.--Ver.It must be remembered that,
whereas we personify Death as of the masculine gender; the Romans
represented the grim tyrant as being a female.It is a curious fact
that we find Death very rarely represented as a skeleton on the Roman
monuments.The skeleton of a child has, in one instance, been found
represented on one of the tombs of Pompeii.The head of a horse was
one of the most common modes of representing death, as it signified
departure.][Footnote 615: Ismarian Orpheus.--Ver.Apollo and the Muse Calliope
were the parents of Orpheus, who met with a cruel death.See the
beginning of the Eleventh Book of the Metamorphoses.]'Ælinon' was said to have been
the exclamation of Apollo, on the death of his son, the poet Linus.The
word is derived from the Greek, 'di Aivôç,' 'Alas!A certain
poetic measure was called by this name; but we learn from Athenaeus,
that it was not always confined to pathetic subjects.There appear to
have been two persons of the name of Linus.One was a Theban, the son of
Apollo, and the instructor of Orpheus and Hercules, while the other was
the son of an Argive princess, by Apollo, who, according to Statius, was
torn to pieces in his infancy by dogs.][Footnote 617: The son of Mæon.See the Note to the ninth
line of the Fifteenth Elegy of the First Book of the Amores.][Footnote 618: Slow web woven.--Ver.[Footnote 619: Nemesis, so Delia.--Ver.Nemesis and Delia were the
names of damsels whose charms were celebrated by Tibullus.][Footnote 620: Sacrifice avail thee.--Ver.He alludes to two lines
in the]

First Elegy of Tibullus.]'Quid tua nunc Isis mihi Delia?quid mihi prosunt]

Ilia tuâ toties sera repuisa manu.']What have I now to do, Delia, with your Isis?what avail me those sistra
so often shaken by your hand?'][Footnote 621: What lying apart.--Ver.During the festival of Isis,
all intercourse with men was forbidden to the female devotees.][Footnote 622: The yawning tomb.--Ver.The place where a person was
burnt was called 'bustum,' if he was afterwards buried on the same spot,
and 'ustrina,' or 'ustrinum,' if he was buried at a different place.See
the Notes to the Fasti, B. ii.[Footnote 623: The towers of Eryx--Ver.He alludes to Venus, who
had a splendid temple on Mount Eryx, in Sicily.][Footnote 624: The Phæacian land.--Ver.The Phæacians were the
ancient people of Corcyra, now the isle of Corfu.Tibullus had attended
Messala thither, and falling ill, was unable to accompany his patron on
his return to Rome, on which he addressed to him the First Elegy of his
Third Book, in which he expressed a hope that he might not die among
the Phæacians.Tibullus afterwards
recovered, and died at Rome.When he penned this line, Ovid little
thought that his own bones would one day rest in a much more ignoble
spot than Corcyra, and one much more repulsive to the habits of
civilization.]1 Hie'here seems to be the preferable
reading; alluding to Rome, in contradistinction to Corcyra.][Footnote 626: His tearful eyes.--Ver.He alludes to the custom of
the nearest relative closing the eyes of the dying person.][Footnote 627: The last gifts.--Ver.The perfumes and other
offerings which were thrown on the burning pile, are here alluded to.Tibullus says, in the same Elegy--]

'Non soror Assyrios cineri quæ dedat odores,]

Et Heat effusis ante sepulchra comis']

'No sister have I here to present to my ashes the Assyrian perfumes,
and to weep before my tomb with dishevelled locks.'To this passage Ovid
makes reference in the next two lines.][Footnote 628: Thy first love.--Ver.'Prior;' his former love was
Delia, who was forsaken by him for Nemesis.They are both represented
here as attending his obsequies.Tibullus says, in the First Elegy of
the First Book, addressing Delia:--]

1 Te spectem, suprema mihi cum venerit hora,]

Te teneam moriens, déficiente manu.]Flebis et arsuro positum me, Delia, lecto,]

Tristibus et lacrymis oscula mista dabis.']May I look upon you when my last hour comes, when dying, may I hold you
with my failing hand.Delia, you will lament me, too, when placed on my
bier, doomed to the pile, and will give me kisses mingled with the tears
of grief.'It would appear
from the present passage, that it was the custom to give the last kiss
when the body was laid on the funeral pile.][Footnote 629: With his failing hand.--Ver.Nemesis here alludes
to the above line, and tells Delia, that she, herself, alone engaged his
affection, as it was she alone who held his hand when he died.][Footnote 630: Learned Catullus.--Ver.Catullus was a Roman poet, a
native of Verona.Calvus was also a Roman poet of great merit.The poems
of Catullus and Calvus were set to music by Hermogenes, Tigellius, and
Demetrius, who were famous composers.lines
427 and 431, and the Notes to the passages.][Footnote 631: Prodigal of thy blood.--Ver.He alludes to the fact
of Gallus having killed himself, and to his having been suspected
of treason against Augustus, from whom he had received many marks of
kindness Ovid seems to hint, in the Tristia, Book ii.446, that the
fault of Gallus was his having divulged the secrets of Augustus, when
he was in a state o* inebriety.Some writers say, that when Governor of
Egypt, he caused his name and exploits to be inscribed on the Pyramids,
and that this constituted his crime.Others again, suppose that he was
guilty of extortion in Egypt, and that he especially harassed the people
of Thebea with his exactions.Some of the Commentators think that under
the name 'amicus,' Augustus is not here referred to, inasmuch as it
woulc seem to bespeak a familiar acquaintanceship, which is not known
to have existed.Scaliger thinks that it must refer to some
misunderstanding which had taken place between Gallus and Tibullus, in
which the former was accused of having deceived his friend.][Footnote 632: The rites of Ceres--Ver.This festival of Ceres
occurred on the Fifth of the Ides of April, being the 12th day of that
month.White garments, were worn at this
festival, and woollen robes of dark colour were prohibited.The worship
was conducted solely by females, and all intercourse with men was
forbidden, who were not allowed to approach the altars of the Goddess.][Footnote 633: The oaks, the early oracles.--Ver.On the oaks, the
oracles of Dodona, see the Translation of the Metamorphoses, pages 253
and 467.][Footnote 634: Having nurtured Jove.--Ver.See an account of the
education of Jupiter, by the Curetes, in Crete, in the Fourth Book of
the Fasti, L 499, et seq.][Footnote 635: Beheld Jasius.--Ver.Iasius, or Iasion, was,
according to most accounts, the son of Jupiter and Electra, and enjoyed
the favour of Ceres, by whom he was the father of Plutus.According
to the Scholiast on Theocritus, he was the son of Minos, and the Nymph
Phronia.According to Apollodorus, he was struck dead by the bolts of
Jupiter, for offering violence to Ceres.He was also said by some to
be the husband of Cybele.He is supposed to have been a successful
husbandman when agriculture was but little known; which circumstance is
thought to have given rise to the story of his familiarity with Ceres.Ovid repeats this charge against the chastity of Ceres, in the Tristia,
Book ii.[Footnote 636: Proportion of their wheat.--Ver.With less corn than
had been originally sown.][Footnote 637: The law-giving Mims.--Ver.Minos is said to have
been the first who gave laws to the Cretans.][Footnote 638: Late have the horns.--Ver.This figure is derived
from the horns, the weapons of the bull.'At length I have assumed the
weapons of defence.'It is rendered in a singular manner in Nisard's
Translation, 'Trop tard, helas 1 J'ai connu l'outrage fait a mon front.'I have known the outrage done to my forehead.'!!!][Footnote 639: Have patience and endure.--Ver.He addresses himself,
recommending fortitude as his only cure.][Footnote 640: The hard ground.--Ver.At the door of his mistress;
a practice which seems to have been very prevalent with the Roman
lovers.][Footnote 641: I was beheld by him.--Ver.As, of courser, his rival
would only laugh at him for his folly, and very deservedly.][Footnote 642: As you walked.--Ver.By the use of the word
'spatiantis,' he alludes to her walks under the Porticos of Rome, which
were much frequented as places for exercise, sheltered from the heat.][Footnote 643: The Gods forsworn.--Ver.This forms the subject of
the Third Elegy of the present Book.][Footnote 644: Young mem at banquets.--Ver.See the Fifth Elegy of
the Second Book of the Amores.][Footnote 645: She was not ill.--Ver.When he arrived, he found his
rival in her company.][Footnote 646: I will hate.--Ver.This and the next line are
considered by Heinsius and other Commentators to be spurious.][Footnote 647: She who but lately.--Ver.Commentators are at a
loss to know whether he is here referring to Corinna, or to his other
mistress, to whom he alludes in the Tenth Elegy of the Second Book,
when he confesses that he is in love with two mistresses.If Corinna was
anything more than an ideal personage, it is probable that she is not
meant here, as he made it a point not to discover to the world who was
meant under that name; whereas, the mistress here mentioned has been
recommended to the notice of the Roman youths by his poems.][Footnote 648: Made proclamation.--Ver.He says that, unconsciously,
he has been doing the duties of the 'præco' or 'crier,' in recommending
his mistress to the public.The 'præco,' among the Romans, was employed
in sales by auction, to advertise the time, place, and conditions of
sale, and very probably to recommend and praise the property offered
for sale.These officers also did the duty of the auctioneer, so far
as calling out the biddings, but the property was knocked down by the
'magister auctionum.'The 'præcones' were also employed to keep silence
in the public assemblies, to pronounce the votes of the centuries, to
summon the plaintiff and defendant upon trials, to proclaim the victors
in the public games, to invite the people to attend public funerals,
to recite the laws that were enacted, and, when goods were lost, to cry
them and search for them.The office of a 'præco' was, in the time of
Cicero, looked upon as rather disreputable.][Footnote 649: Thebes.--Ver.He speaks of the Theban war, the
Trojan war, and the exploits of Caesar, as being good subjects for Epic
poetry; but he says that he had neglected them, and had wasted his time
in singing in praise of Corinna.This, however, may be said in reproof
of his general habits of indolence, and not as necessarily implying that
Corinna is the cause of his present complaint.The Roman poet Statius
afterwards chose the Theban war as his subject.][Footnote 650: Poets as witnesses.--Ver.That is, 'to rely
implicitly on the testimony of poets.'The word 'poetas' requires a
semicolon after it, and not a comma.][Footnote 651: The raging dogs.--Ver.He here falls into his usual
mistake of confounding Scylla, the daughter of Nisus, with Scylla, the
Nymph, the rival of Circe, in the affections of Glaucus.33 of the First Epistle of Sabinus, and the Eighth and Fourteenth
Books of the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 652: Descendant of Abas.--Ver.In the Fourth Book of the
Metamorphoses he relates the rescue of Andromeda from the sea monster,
by Perseus, the descendant of Abas, and clearly implies that he used
the services of the winged horse Pegasus on that occasion.It has been
suggested by some Commentators, that he here refers to Bellerophon; but
that hero was not a descendant of Abas, and, singularly enough, he is
not on any occasion mentioned or referred to by Ovid.][Footnote 653: Extended Tityus.--Ver.Tityus was a giant, the son
of Jupiter and Elara.Offering violence to Latona, he was pierced by the
darts of Apollo and hurled to the Infernal Regions, where his liver was
doomed to feed a vulture, without being consumed.][Footnote 654: Enceladus.--Ver.He was the son of Titan and Terra,
and joining in the war against the Gods, he was struck by lightning,
and thrown beneath Mount Ætna.See the Pontic Epistles, Book ii.[Footnote 655: The-two-shaped damsels.--Ver.He evidently alludes
to the Sirens, with their two shapes, and not to Circe, as some have
imagined.][Footnote 656: The Ithacan bags.--Ver.Æolus gave Ulysses
favourable wind* sewn up in a leather bag, to aid him in his return to
Ithaca.See tha Metamorphoses, Book xiv.223]

[Footnote 657: The Cecropian bird.--Ver.He calls Philomela the
daughter of Pandion, king of Athens, 'Cecropis ales Cc crops having been
the first king of Athens.Her story is told in the Sixth Book of the
Metamorphoses.][Footnote 658: A bird, or into gold.--Ver.He alludes to the
transformation of Jupiter into a swan, a shower of gold, and a bull; in
the cases of Leda, Danaë, and Europa.][Footnote 659: The Theban seed.--Ver.He alludes to the dragon's
teeth sown by Cadmus.See the Third Book of the Metamorphoses.][Footnote 660: Distil amber tears.--Ver.Reference is made to the
transformation of the sisters of Phaeton into poplars that distilled
amber.See the Second Book of the Metamorphoses, 1.[Footnote 661: Who once were ships.--Ver.He alludes to the ships
of Æneas, which, when set on fire by Turnus, were changed into sea
Nymphs.][Footnote 662: The hellish banquet.--Ver.Reference is made to the
revenge of Atreus, who killed the children of Thyestes, and set them
on table before their father, on which occasion the Sun is said to have
hidden his face.][Footnote 663: Stonesfollowed the lyre.--Ver.Amphion is said to
have raised the walls of Thebes by the sound of his lyre.][Footnote 664: Camillus, by thee.--Ver.Marcus Furius Camillus, the
Roman general, took the city of Falisci.][Footnote 665: The covered paths.--Ver.The pipers, or flute
players, led the procession, while the ground was covered with carpets
or tapestry.][Footnote 666: Snow-white heifers.--Ver.Pliny the Elder, in his
Second Book, says, 'The river Clitumnus, in the state of Falisci, makes
those cattle white that drink of its waters.'][Footnote 667: In the lofty woods.--Ver.It is not known to what
occasion this refers.Juno is stated to have concealed herself on two
occasions; once before her marriage, when she fled from the pursuit of
Jupiter, who assumed the form of a cuckoo, that he might deceive her;
and again, when, through fear of the giants, the Gods took refuge in
Egypt and Libya.[Footnote 668: As a mark.--Ver.This is similar to the alleged
origin of the custom of throwing sticks at cocks on Shrove Tuesday.The
Saxons being about to rise in rebellion against their Norman oppressors,
the conspiracy is said to have been discovered through the inopportune
crowing of a cock, in revenge for which the whole race of chanticleers
were for centuries submitted to this cruel punishment.][Footnote 669: With garments.--Ver.As'vestis' was a general name
for a covering of any kind, it may refer to the carpets which appear to
be mentioned in the twelfth line, or it may mean, that the youths and
damsels threw their own garments in the path of the procession.][Footnote 670: After the Grecian manner.--Ver.Falisci was said to
have been a Grecian colony.][Footnote 671: Hold religious silence.--Ver.'Favere linguis' seems
here to mean, 'to keep religious silence as to the general meaning of
the term, see the Fasti, Book i.[Footnote 672: Halesus.--Ver.Halesus is said to have been the son
of Agamemnon, by a concubine.Alarmed at the tragic death of his father,
and of the murderers, Ægisthus and Clytemnestra, he fled to Italy, where
he founded the city of Phalesus, which title, with the addition of
one letter, was given to it after his name.Phalesus afterwards became
corrupted, to 'Faliscus,' or 'Falisci.'][Footnote 673: One side and the other.--Ver.For the 'torus
exterior' and 'interior,' and the construction of the beds of the
ancients, see the Note to the Eighth Book of the Metamorphoses, 1.This passage seems to be hopelessly
corrupt.][Footnote 674: Turning-place is grazed.--Ver.On rounding the'meta'
in the chariot race, from which the present figure is derived, see the
Note to the 69th line of the Second Elegy of this Book.][Footnote 675: Heir to my rank.--Ver.112, where he enlarges upon the rank and circumstances of his family.][Footnote 676: To glorious arms.--Ver.He alludes to the Social
war which was commenced in the year of the City 659, by the Marsi, the
Peligni, and the Picentes, for the purpose of obtaining equal rights
and privileges with the Roman citizens.He calls them 'arma honesta,'
because wielded in defence of their liberties.][Footnote 677: Rome dreaded.--Ver.The Romans were so alarmed, that
they vowed to celebrate games in honour of Jupiter, if their arms should
prove successful.][Footnote 678: Amathusian parent.--Ver.Venus was worshipped
especially at Amathus, a city of Cyprus; it is mentioned by Ovid as
abounding in metals.[Footnote 679: The homed.--Ver.In addition to the reasons already
mentioned for Bacchus being represented as horned, it is said, by some,
that it arose from the fact, of wine being drunk from horns in the
early ages.It has been suggested, that it had a figurative meaning, and
implied the violence of those who are overtaken with wine.][Footnote 680: Lyæus.--Ver.For the meaning of the word Lyæus, see
the Metamorphoses, Book iv.[Footnote 681: My sportive.--Ver.Genialis; the Genii were the
Deities of pure, unadorned nature.58, and
the Note to the passage.'Genialis,' consequently, 'voluptuous,' or
'pleasing to the impulses of nature.'][Illustration]

                      At other times, all breathless grouped
                      O'er crucibles, the Brownies stooped
    To separate, with greatest skill,
    The grains which cure from those that kill;
    While burning acids, blazes blue,
    And odors strong confused the crew.Cried one: "Through trials hard to bear,
    The student must himself prepare,
    Though mixing paint, or mixing pill--
        Or mixing phrases, if you will--
        No careless study satisfies
             If one would to distinction rise;
                  The minds that shed from pole to pole
                  The light of years, as round we roll,
                  Are first enriched through patient toil,
                  And kindled by the midnight oil."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

          Thus, spicing logic with a joke,
          They chatted on till morning broke;
    And then with wild and rapid race
    The Brownie band forsook the place.Sandra journeyed to the hallway.THE BROWNIES IN THE ORCHARD.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

          The autumn nights began to fill
            The mind with thoughts of winter chill,
            When Brownies in an orchard met,
            Where ripened fruit was hanging yet.Said one, "The apples here, indeed,
            Must now be mellow to the seed;
    And, ere another night, should be
    Removed at once from every tree.For any evening now may call
    The frost to nip and ruin all."Another quickly answer made:
    "This man is scarcely worthy aid;
    'Tis said his harsh and cruel sway
                   Has turned his children's love away."It matters not who owns the place,
                   Or why neglect thus shows its face,"
                   A third replied; "the fact is clear
                   That fruit should hang no longer here.If worthy people here reside
                   Then will our hands be well applied;
                   And if unworthy folks we serve,
                   Still better notice we'll deserve."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            "You speak our minds so full and fair,"
          One loudly cried, "that speech we'll spare.But like the buttons on your back,
      We'll follow closely in your track,
    And do our part with willing hand,
    Without one doubting _if_ or _and_."Kind deeds the Brownies often do
      Unknown to me as well as you;
        The wounded hare, by hunters maimed,
          Is sheltered and supplied and tamed.The straying cat they sometimes find
                   Half-starved, and chased by dogs unkind,
                   And bring it home from many fears
                   To those who mourned its loss with tears.And to the bird so young and bare,
                                     With wings unfit to fan the air,
                                     That preying owls had thought to rend
                                     The Brownie often proves a friend.[Illustration]

                     Then bags and baskets were brought out
                     From barns and buildings round about,
                     With kettles, pans, and wooden-ware,
                     That prying eyes discovered there;
                     Nay, even blankets from the beds,
                     The pillow-slips, and table-spreads
    Were in some manner brought to light
    To render service through the night.[Illustration]

                   If there's a place where Brownies feel
                   At home with either hand or heel,
                   And seem from all restrictions free,
                   That place is in a branching tree.At times, with balance fair and fine
                   They held their stations in a line;
                   At times, in rivalry and pride
                   To outer twigs they scattered wide;
                   And oft with one united strain
                   They shook the tree with might and main,
    Till, swaying wildly to and fro,
    It rocked upon the roots below.So skilled at climbing were they all
    The sum of accidents was small:
    Some hats were crushed, some heads were sore,
    Some backs were blue, ere work was o'er;
                 For hands will slip and feet will slide,
                 And boughs will break and forks divide,
                 And hours that promise sport sublime
                 May introduce a limping time.So some who clambered up the tree
    With ready use of hand and knee,
    Found other ways they could descend
    Than by the trunk, you may depend.The startled birds of night came out
    And watched them as they moved about;
    Concluding thieves were out in force
    They cawed around the place till hoarse.But birds, like people, should be slow
    To judge before the facts they know;
                              For neither tramps nor thieves were here,
                              But Brownies, honest and sincere,
                              Who worked like mad to strip the trees
                              Before they felt the morning breeze.And well they gauged their task and time,
                              For ere the sun commenced to prime
                   The sky with faintest tinge of red
                   The Brownies from the orchard fled,
                   While all the fruit was laid with care
                   Beyond the reach of nipping air.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' [Illustration] YACHT-RACE.[Illustration]

    When fleets of yachts were sailing round
    The rippling bay and ruffled sound,
    And steering out where Neptune raves,
    To try their speed in rougher waves,
    The Brownies from a lofty place
    Looked out upon the novel race.Said one: "A race is under way.They'll start from somewhere in the bay,
    To leave the frowning forts behind,
    And Jersey headlands, as you'll find,
    And sail around, as I surmise,
    The light-ship that at anchor lies.All sails are spread, the masts will bend,
    For some rich prize they now contend--
    A golden cup or goblet fine,
    Or punch-bowl of antique design."Another said: "To-night, when all
    Have left the boats, we'll make a call,
    And boldly sail a yacht or two
    Around that ship, as people do.[Illustration]

    If I can read the signs aright
    That nature shows 'twill be a night
    When sails will stretch before the blast,
    And not hang idly round the mast."[Illustration]

    So thus they talked, and plans they laid,
    And waited for the evening shade.And when the lamps in city square
    And narrow street began to glare,
    The Brownies ventured from their place
    To find the yachts and sail their race.[Illustration]

    In equal numbers now the band,
    Divided up, the vessels manned.Short time they wasted in debate
    Who should be captain, cook, or mate;
    But it was settled at the start
    That all would take an active part,
    And be prepared to pull and haul
    If trouble came in shape of squall.For in the cunning Brownie crowd
    No domineering is allowed;
    All stand alike with equal power,
    And friendly feeling rules the hour.[Illustration]

    The Brownies' prophecy was true.That night the wind increased and blew,
    And dipped the sails into the wave,
    And work to every Brownie gave;
    Not one on board but had to clew,
    Or reef, or steer, or something do.Sometimes the yachts ran side by side
    A mile or more, then parted wide,
    Still tacking round and shifting sail
    To take advantage of the gale.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Sometimes a sloop beyond control
    At random ran, or punched a hole
    Clean through her scudding rival's jibs,
    Or thumped her soundly on the ribs.Of Brownies there were two or three
    Who tumbled headlong in the sea,
    While they performed some action bold,
    And failed to keep a proper hold.At first it seemed they would be lost;
    For here and there they pitched and tossed,
    Now on the crests of billows white,
    Now in the trough, clear out of sight,
    But all the while with valiant heart
    Performing miracles of art.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Some life-preservers soon were thrown;
    And ready hands let sails alone,
    And turned to render aid with speed
    To those who stood so much in need.But accident could not displace
    Or weaken interest in the race;
    And soon each active Brownie stood
    Where he could do the greatest good;
    It mattered not if shifting sail,
    Or at the helm, or on the rail.With arm to arm and hip to hip,
    They lay in rows to trim the ship.[Illustration]

    All hands were anxious to succeed
    And prove their yachts had greatest speed.But though we sail, or though we ride,
    Or though we sleep, the moments glide;
    And none must bear this fact in mind
    More constantly than Brownie kind.For stars began to lose their glow
    While Brownies still had miles to go.Said one, who scanned the eastern sky
    With doubtless an experienced eye:
    "We'll crowd all sail, for fear the day
    Will find us still upon the bay--
    Since it would prove a sad affair
    If morning light should find us there."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    But when the winds began to fail
    And lightly pressed the flapping sail,
    It was determined by the band
    To run their yachts to nearest land,
    So they could reach their hiding-place
    Before the sun revealed his face.[Illustration]

    By happy chance a cove they reached
    Where high and dry the boats were beached,
    And all in safety made their way
    To secret haunts without delay.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES AT ARCHERY.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

          One night the Brownies strayed around
          A green and level stretch of ground,
          Where young folk oft their skill displayed
          At archery, till evening's shade.The targets standing in the park,
          With arrows resting in the mark,
    Soon showed the cunning Brownie band
    The skill of those who'd tried a hand.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

          A few in outer rings were fast,
          Some pierced the "gold," and more had passed
          Without a touch, until they sank
          In trunk of tree or grassy bank.Said one: "On page and parchment old,
          The story often has been told,
          How men of valor bent the bow
          To spread confusion through the foe.And even now, in later times
          (As travelers find in distant climes),
    Some savage tribes on plain and hill
    Can make it interesting still."Another spoke: "A scene like this,
    Reminds me of that valiant Swiss,
    Who in the dark and trying hour
    Revealed such nerve and matchless power,
          And from the head of his brave son
          The apple shot, and freedom won!While such a chance is offered here,
          We'll find the bows that must be near,
          And as an hour or two of night
          Will bring us 'round the morning light,
          We'll take such targets as we may,
            To safer haunts, some miles away.Then at our leisure we can shoot
            At bull's-eyes round or luscious fruit,
            Till like the Swiss of olden time,
            With steady nerves and skill sublime,
            Each one can split an apple fair
            On every head that offers there."[Illustration]

    Now buildings that were fastened tight
    Against the prowlers of the night,
    At the wee Brownies' touch and call
    Soon opened and surrendered all.So some with bulky targets strode,
    That made for eight or ten a load.And called for engineering skill
    To steer them up or down the hill;
    Some carried bows of rarest kind,
    That reached before and trailed behind.The English "self-yew" bow was there,
    Of nicest make and "cast" so rare,
    Well tipped with horn, the proper thing,
    With "nocks," or notches, for the string.Still others formed an "arrow line"
    That bristled like the porcupine.[Illustration]

    When safe within the forest shade,
    The targets often were displayed.At first, however near they stood,
    Some scattered trouble through the wood.The trees were stripped of leaves and bark,
    With arrows searching for the mark.The hares to other groves withdrew,
    And frighted birds in circles flew.But practice soon improves the art
        Of all, however dull or smart;
                             And there they stood to do their best,
                             And let all other pleasures rest,
                             While quickly grew their skill and power,
                             And confidence, from hour to hour.[Illustration]

    When targets seemed too plain or wide,
    A smaller mark the Brownies tried.By turns each member took his stand
    And risked his head to serve the band.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    For volunteers would bravely hold
    A pumpkin till in halves it rolled;
    And then a turnip, quince, or pear,
    Would next be shot to pieces there;
    Till not alone the apples flew
    In halves before their arrows true,
    But even plums and cherries too.For Brownies, as we often find,
    Can soon excel the human kind,
    And carry off with effort slight
    The highest praise and honors bright.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES FISHING.[Illustration]

    When glassy lakes and streams about
    Gave up their bass and speckled trout,
    The Brownies stood by water clear
    As shades of evening gathered near.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                          Said one: "Now country lads begin
                          To trim the rod and bend the pin
                          To catch the frogs and minnows spry
                          That in the brooks and ditches lie.While city chaps with reels come down,
                          And line enough to gird the town,
                          And flies of stranger shape and hue
                          Than ever Mother Nature knew--
                          With horns like crickets, tails like mice,
                          And plumes like birds of Paradise.Thus well prepared for sunny sky
              Or cloudy weather, wet or dry,
              They take the fish from stream and pool
              By native art and printed rule."Another said: "With peeping eyes
              I've watched an angler fighting flies,
              And thought, when thus he stood to bear
              The torture from those pests of air,
              There must indeed be pleasure fine
              Behind the baited hook and line.Now, off like arrows from the bow
    In search of tackle some must go;
    While others stay to dig supplies
    Of bait that anglers highly prize,--
    Such kind as best will bring the pout
    The dace, the chub, and'shiner' out;
    While locusts gathered from the grass
    Will answer well for thorny bass."Then some with speed for tackle start,
    And some to sandy banks depart,
              And some uplift a stone or rail
              In search of cricket, grub, or snail;
    While more in dewy meadows draw
    The drowsy locust from the straw.Nor is it long before the band
    Stands ready for the sport in hand.It seemed the time of all the year
    When fish the starving stage were near:
              They rose to straws and bits of bark,
              To bubbles bright and shadows dark,
              And jumped at hooks, concealed or bare,
              While yet they dangled in the air.Some Brownies many trials met
              Almost before their lines were wet;
              For stones below would hold them fast,
    And limbs above would stop the cast,
    And hands be forced to take a rest,
    At times when fish were biting best.Some stumbled in above their boots,
    And others spoiled their finest suits;
    But fun went on; for many there
    Had hooks that seemed a charm to bear,
    And fish of various scale and fin
    On every side were gathered in.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The catfish left his bed below,
    With croaks and protests from the go;
    And nerve as well as time it took
    From such a maw to win the hook.With horns that pointed every way,
    And life that seemed to stick and stay,
    Like antlered stag that stands at bay,
    He lay and eyed the Brownie band,
    And threatened every reaching hand.The gamy bass, when playing fine,
    Oft tried the strength of hook and line,
    And strove an hour before his mind
    To changing quarters was resigned.Some eels proved more than even match
    For those who made the wondrous catch,
        And, like a fortune won with ease,
        They slipped through fingers by degrees,
        And bade good-bye to margin sands,
        In spite of half a dozen hands.The hungry, wakeful birds of air
        Soon gathered 'round to claim their share,
        And did for days themselves regale
        On fish of every stripe and scale.Thus sport went on with laugh and shout,
        As hooks went in and fish came out,
        While more escaped with wounded gill,
        And yards of line they're trailing still;
        But day at length began to break,
        And forced the Brownies from the lake.[Illustration]




[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES AT NIAGARA FALLS.[Illustration]

    The Brownies' Band, while passing through
    The country with some scheme in view,
    Paused in their race, and well they might,
    When broad Niagara came in sight.Said one: "Give ear to what I say,
    I've been a traveler in my day;
    I've waded through Canadian mud
    To Montmorenci's tumbling flood.Niagara is the fall
    That truly overtops them all--
    The children prattle of its tide,
    And age repeats its name with pride
    The school-boy draws it on his slate,
    The preacher owns its moral weight;
    The tourist views it dumb with awe,
    The Indian paints it for his squaw,
    And tells how many a warrior true
    Went o'er it in his bark canoe,
    And never after friend or foe
    Got sight of man or boat below."Another said: "The Brownie Band
    Upon the trembling brink may stand,
    Where kings and queens have sighed to be,
    But dare not risk themselves at sea."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

        Some played along the shelving ledge
        That beetled o'er the river's edge;
        Some gazed in meditation deep
        Upon the water's fearful leap;
        Some went below, to crawl about
        Behind the fall, that shooting out
        Left space where they might safely stand
        And view the scene so wild and grand.Some climbed the trees of cedar kind,
        That o'er the rushing stream inclined,
    To find a seat, to swing and frisk
    And bend the boughs at fearful risk;
    Until the rogues could dip and lave
    Their toes at times beneath the wave.Still more and more would venture out
        In spite of every warning shout.At last the weight that dangled there
        Was greater than the tree could bear.And then the snapping roots let go
        Their hold upon the rocks below,
        And leaping out away it rode
        Upon the stream with all its load!Then shouts that rose above the roar
        Went up from tree-top, and from shore,
        When it was thought that half the band
        Was now forever leaving land.It chanced, for reasons of their own,
        Some men around that tree had thrown
        A lengthy rope that still was strong
        And stretching fifty feet along.Before it disappeared from sight,
        The Brownies seized it in their might,
        And then a strain for half an hour
        Went on between the mystic power
        Of Brownie hands united all,
        And water rushing o'er the fall.But true to friends the
        Brownies strained,
        And inch by inch the tree was gained.Across the awful bend it passed
        With those in danger clinging fast,
        And soon it reached the rocky shore
        With all the Brownies safe once more.And then, as morning showed her face,
        The Brownies hastened from the place.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' GARDEN.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                One night, as spring began to show
                In buds above and blades below,
                The Brownies reached a garden square
                That seemed in need of proper care.Said one, "Neglected ground like this
                Must argue some one most remiss,
                Or beds and paths would here be found
                Instead of rubbish scattered round.Old staves, and boots, and woolen strings,
                With bottles, bones, and wire-springs,
    Are quite unsightly things to see
    Where tender plants should sprouting be.This work must be progressing soon,
    If blossoms are to smile in June."A second said, "Let all give heed:
    On me depend to find the seed.For, thanks to my foreseeing mind,
    To merchants' goods we're not confined.Last autumn, when the leaves grew sere
    And birds sought regions less severe,
    One night through gardens fair I sped,
    And gathered seeds from every bed;
    Then placed them in a hollow tree,
    Where still they rest.So trust to me
    To bring supplies, while you prepare
    The mellow garden-soil with care."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Another cried, "While some one goes
    To find the shovels, rakes, and hoes,
    That in the sheds are stowed away,
    We'll use this plow as best we may.Our arms, united at the chain,
                Will not be exercised in vain,
                But, as if colts were in the trace,
    We'll make it dance around the place.I know how deep the share should go,
    And how the sods to overthrow.So not a patch of ground the size
    Of this old cap, when flat it lies,
    But shall attentive care receive,
                    And be improved before we leave."Then some to guide the plow began,
                    Others the walks and beds to plan.And soon they gazed with anxious eyes
                    For those who ran for seed-supplies.But, when they came, one had his say,
                    And thus explained the long delay:
                    "A woodchuck in the tree had made
                    His bed just where the seeds were laid.We wasted half an hour at least
                    In striving to dislodge the beast;
          Until at length he turned around,
          Then, quick as thought, without a sound,
          And ere he had his bearings got,
          The rogue was half across the lot."Then seed was sown in various styles,
    In circles, squares, and single files;
    While here and there, in central parts,
    They fashioned diamonds, stars, and hearts,
    Some using rake, some plying hoe,
    Some making holes where seed should go;
    While some laid garden tools aside
    And to the soil their hands applied.To stakes and racks more were assigned,
    That climbing-vines support might find.Cried one, "Here, side by side, will stand
    The fairest flowers in the land.The thrifty bees for miles around
    Ere long will seek this plot of ground,
    And be surprised to find each morn
    New blossoms do each bed adorn.And in their own peculiar screed
    Will bless the hands that sowed the seed."And while that night they labored there,
    The cunning rogues had taken care
    With sticks and strings to nicely frame
    In line the letters of their name.That when came round the proper time
    For plants to leaf and vines to climb,
    The Brownies would remembered be,
    If people there had eyes to see.But morning broke (as break it will
    Though one's awake or sleeping still),
    And then the seeds on every side
    The hurried Brownies scattered wide.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration: BROWNIE]

    Along the road and through the lane
    They pattered on the ground like rain,
    Where Brownies, as away they flew,
    Both right and left full handfuls threw,
    And children often halted there
    To pick the blossoms, sweet and fair,
    That sprung like daisies from the mead
    Where fleeing Brownies flung the seed.[Illustration]

[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' CELEBRATION.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

        One night the Brownies reached a mound
        That rose above the country round.Said one, as seated on the place
        He glanced about with thoughtful face:
        "If almanacs have matters right
    The Fourth begins at twelve to-night,--
    A fitting time for us to fill
    Yon cannon there and shake the hill,
    And make the people all about
    Think war again has broken out.I know where powder may be found
              Both by the keg and by the pound;
              Men use it in a tunnel near
              For blasting purposes, I hear.To get supplies all hands will go,
    And when we come we'll not be slow
    To teach the folks the proper way
    To honor Independence Day."Then from the muzzle broke the flame,
                And echo answered to the sound
                That startled folk for miles around.'Twas lucky for the Brownies' Band
                They were not of the mortal brand,
                Or half the crew would have been hurled
                In pieces to another world.For when at last the cannon roared,
                So huge the charge had Brownies poured,
    The metal of the gun rebelled
    And threw all ways the load it held.The pieces clipped the daisy-heads
    And tore the tree-tops into shreds.But Brownies are not slow to spy
    A danger, as are you and I.[Illustration:

    'Tis the star spangled banner
    O long may it wave
    O'er the land of the free
    and the home of the brave

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                For they through strange and mystic art
                Observed it as it flew apart,
                And ducked and dodged and flattened out,
                To shun the fragments flung about.Some rogues were lifted from their feet
    And, turning somersaults complete,
    Like leaves went twirling through the air
    But only to receive a scare;
    And ere the smoke away had cleared
    In forest shade they disappeared.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES IN THE SWIMMING-SCHOOL.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    While Brownies passed along the street,
    Commenting on the summer's heat
    That wrapped the city day and night,
    A swimming-bath appeared in sight.Said one: "Of all the sights we've found,
    Since we commenced to ramble round,
    This seems to better suit the band
    Than anything, however grand.We'll rest awhile and find our way
    Inside the place without delay,
    And those who understand the art,
    Can knowledge to the rest impart;
        For every one should able be,
        To swim, in river, lake, or sea.We never know how soon we may,
        See some one sinking in dismay,--
        And then, to have the power to save
    A comrade from a watery grave,
    Will be a blessing sure to give
    Us joy the longest day we live."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The doors soon opened through the power
    That lay in Brownie hands that hour.When once within the fun began,
    As here and there they quickly ran;
    Some up the stairs made haste to go,
    Some into dressing-rooms below,
    In bathing-trunks to reappear
    And plunge into the water clear;
    Some from the spring-board leaping fair
    Would turn a somersault in air;
    More to the bottom like a stone,
    Would sink as soon as left alone,
    While others after trial brief
    Could float as buoyant as a leaf.[Illustration]

    Some all their time to others gave
    Assisting them to ride the wave,
    Explaining how to catch the trick,
    Both how to strike and how to kick;
    And still keep nose above the tide,
    That lungs with air might be supplied.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Thus diving in and climbing out,
    Or splashing round with laugh and shout,
    The happy band in water played
    As long as Night her scepter swayed.They heard the clocks in chapel towers
    Proclaim the swiftly passing hours.But when the sun looked from his bed
    To tint the eastern sky with red,
    In haste the frightened Brownies threw
    Their clothes about them and withdrew.[Illustration: TIME FLIES]




THE BROWNIES [Illustration] AND THE WHALE.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    As Brownies chanced at eve to stray
    Around a wide but shallow bay,
    Not far from shore, to their surprise,
    They saw a whale of monstrous size,
      That, favored by the wind and tide,
      Had ventured in from ocean wide,
      But waves receding by-and-by,
      Soon left him with a scant supply.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            At times, with flaps and lunges strong
            He worked his way some yards along,
            Till on a bar or sandy marge
            He grounded like a leaden barge."A chance like this for all the band,"
            Cried one, "but seldom comes to hand.I know the bottom of this bay
            Like those who made the coast survey.'Tis level as a threshing-floor
            And shallow now from shore to shore;
            That creature's back will be as dry
    As hay beneath a                  tropic sky,
    Till morning tide                 comes full and free
    And gives him aid                 to reach the sea."another cried;
    "Let all make haste               to gain his side
            Then clamber up as best we may,
            And ride him round till break of day."At once, the band in great delight
                         Went splashing through the water bright,
                         And soon to where he rolled about
                         They lightly swam, or waded out.Now climbing up, the Brownies tried
            To take position for the ride.Some lying down a hold maintained;
            More, losing place as soon as gained,
            Were forced a dozen times to scale
            The broad side of the stranded whale.Now half-afloat and half-aground
            The burdened monster circled round,
    Still groping clumsily about
    As if to find the channel out,
    And Brownies clustered close, in fear
    That darker moments might be near.And soon the dullest in the band
    Was sharp enough to understand
    The creature was no longer beached,
    But deeper water now had reached.For plunging left, or plunging right,
    Or plowing downward in his might,
    The fact was plain, as plain could be--
    The whale was working out to sea![Illustration]

    A creeping fear will seize the mind
    As one is leaving shores behind,
    And knows the bark whereon he sails
    Is hardly fit to weather gales.Soon Fancy, with a graphic sweep,
    Portrays the nightmares of the deep;
    While they can see, with living eye,
    The terrors of the air sweep by.[Illustration]

        For who would not a fierce bird dread,
        If it came flying at his head?And these were hungry, squawking things,
        With open beaks and flapping wings.They made the Brownies dodge and dip,
        Into the sea they feared to slip.The birds they viewed with chattering teeth,
    Yet dreaded more the foes beneath.The lobster, with his ready claw;
    The fish with sword, the fish with saw;
    The hermit-crab, in coral hall,
    Averse to every social call;
    The father-lasher, and the shrimp,
    The cuttle-fish, or ocean imp,
    All these increase the landsman's fright,
    As shores are fading out of sight.Such fear soon gained complete command
    Of every Brownie in the band.They looked behind, where fair and green
    The grassy banks and woods were seen.They looked ahead, where white and cold
    The foaming waves of ocean rolled,
    And then, with woful faces drew
    Comparisons between the two.[Illustration]

    Some blamed themselves for action rash
    Against all reason still to dash
    In danger's way, and never think
    Until they stood on ruin's brink.While others threw the blame on those
    Who did the risky trip propose.But meantime deep and deeper still
    The whale was settling down until
    His back looked like an island small
    That scarce gave standing-room to all.But, when their chance seemed slight indeed
    To sport again o'er dewy mead,
    The spouting whale, with movement strong,
    Ran crashing through some timbers long
    That lumbermen had strongly tied
    In cribs and rafts, an acre wide.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    'Twas then, in such a trying hour,
    The Brownies showed their nerve and power.The diving whale gave little time
    For them to choose a stick to climb,--
    But grips were strong; no hold was lost,
    However high the logs were tossed;
    By happy chance the boom remained
    That to the nearest shore was chained,
    And o'er that bridge the Brownies made
    A safe retreat to forest shade.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' KITES.[Illustration]

    The sun had hardly taken flight
    Unto the deepest caves of night;
    Or fowls secured a place of rest
    Where Reynard's paw could not molest,
    When Brownies gathered to pursue
    Their plans regarding pleasures new.Said one: "In spite of hand or string,
        Now hats fly round like crows in spring,
        Exposing heads to gusts of air,
    That ill the slightest draught can bear;
    While, high above the tallest tower,
    At morning, noon, and evening hour,
    The youngsters' kites with streaming tails
    Are riding out the strongest gales.The doves in steeples hide away
        Or keep their houses through the day,
        Mistaking every kite that flies
        For bird of prey of wondrous size."[Illustration]

        "You're not alone," another cried,
        "In taking note.I, too, have spied
        The boys of late, in street and court,
        Or on the roofs, at this fine sport;
        But yesternight I chanced to see
        A kite entangled in a tree.The string was nowhere to be found;
        The tail about a bough was wound.Some birds had torn the paper out,
        To line their nests, in trees about,
        But there beside the wreck I staid,
        Until I learned how kites are made.On me you safely may depend,
        To show the way to cut and bend.So let us now, while winds are high,
        Our hands at once to work apply;
        And from the hill that lifts its crown
        So far above the neighboring town,
        We'll send our kites aloft in crowds,
        To lose themselves among the clouds."A smile on every face was spread,
        At thought of fun like this, ahead;
        And quickly all the plans were laid,
        And work for every Brownie made.Some to the kitchens ran in haste,
        To manufacture pots of paste.Some ran for tacks or shingle-nails,
        And some for rags to make the tails,
        While more with loads of paper came,
        Or whittled sticks to make the frame.The strings, that others gathered, soon
        Seemed long enough to reach the moon.But where such quantities they found,
        'Tis not so easy to expound;--
        Perhaps some twine-shop, standing nigh,
        Was raided for the large supply;
        Perhaps some youthful angler whines
        About his missing fishing-lines.But let them find                   things where they will,
    The Brownies must                   be furnished still;
    And those who can't                 such losses stand,
    Will have to charge                 it to the Band.With busy fingers,                  well applied,
    They clipped and                    pasted, bent and tied;
    With paint and                      brush some ran about
    From kite to kite,                  to fit them out.On some they paint                  a visage fair,
    While others would                  affright a bear,
        Nor was it long (as one might guess
        Who knows what skill their hands possess)
        Before the kites, with string and tail,
        Were all prepared to ride the gale;
        And oh, the climax of their glee
        Was reached when kites were floating free!So quick they mounted through the air
        That tangling strings played mischief there,
    And threatened to remove from land
    Some valued members of the band.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The birds of night were horrified
    At finding kites on every side,
    And netted strings, that seemed to be
    Designed to limit action free.But Brownies stood or ran about,
    Now winding up, now letting out;
    Now giving kites more tail or wing,
    Now wishing for a longer string;
    Until they saw the hints of day
    Approaching through the morning gray.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' DANCING-SCHOOL.[Illustration]

    When flitting bats commenced to wheel
    Around the eaves to find their meal,
    And owls to hoot in forests wide,
    To call their owlets to their side,
    The Brownie Band, in full array,
    Through silent streets pursued their way.But as they neared a building high,
    Surprise was shown in every eye.They heard the strains of music sweet,
    And tripping of the dancers' feet;
    While o'er the tap of heel and toe,
    The twang of harp and scrape of bow,
    Arose the clear and ringing call
    Of those who had control of all.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The Brownies slackened their swift pace,
    Then gathered closely round the place,
            To study out some way to win
            A peep or two at those within.Said one: "In matters of this kind
            Opinions differ, you will find.And some might say, with sober thought,
            That children should not thus be taught
            To hop around on toe and heel
            So actively to fiddle's squeal,
                For fear 'twould turn their minds away
                From graver duties of the day."Another said: "The dancing art
                Doth ease to every move impart.It gives alike to city-bred
                And country-born a graceful tread,
            And helps them bear themselves along
            Without offense in greatest throng.The nimble step, the springing knee,
    And balanced body all agree.The feet, my friends, may glide with grace
    As well as trudge from place to place.And in the parlor or without
    They best can stand or walk about
    Who found in early life a chance
    To mingle in the sprightly dance."[Illustration]

    The Brownies need no ladders long,
    No hoists, nor elevators strong,
    To lift them to an upper flight,
    A window-sill, or transom light.The weather-vane upon the spire,
    That overlooks the town entire,
    Is not too high above the base
    If fancy leads them to the place.'Tis said the very fleecy clouds
    They can bestride in eager crowds,
    Around the world their way to find,
    And leave the lagging winds behind.Said one: "We've scaled the dizzy heights
    Of mountain-peaks on other nights,
    And crossed the stream from shore to shore
    Where but the string-piece stretched before;
    And cunning Brownies, never fear,
    Will find some way to enter here."[Illustration]

    When once the Brownies' plans were laid,
    No formal, tiresome speech was made.In mystic ways, to Brownies known,
    They clambered up the walls of stone.They clung to this and that, like briers,
    They climbed the smooth electric wires;
    Some members lending ready aid
    To those who weaker nerves displayed.And in five minutes at the most,
    By vine, by bracket, and by post,
    By every scroll, and carving bold,
    That toes could touch or fingers hold
    They made their way, and gained a chance
    To view, unnoticed, every dance.Said one: "How pleasant is the sight
    To see those children young and bright
    While skipping blithely to and fro,
    Now joined in pairs, now in a row,
    Or formed in circles, hand in hand,
    And lightly moving at command--

[Illustration]

        Like butterflies through balmy air
        When summer spreads attractions fair,
    And blends with every whispering breeze
    The drowsy hum of working bees."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Another said: "When this is o'er
    The Brownie Band will take the floor.We'll bide our time and not be slow
            To take possession when they go.Then up and down the spacious hall
              We'll imitate the steps of all.We'll show that not in Frenchmen's bones
              Lies all the grace that nature owns;
              That others at the waltz can shine
              As well as Germans from the Rhine;
            That we some capers can enjoy
            As well as natives of Savoy."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            While thus they talked, the moments flew,
            And soon the master's task was through.When children's cloaks were wrapped around,
    And heavier shoes their feet had found
    They hastened home; but while they slept
    The Brownies in that building crept
    To take their turn at lively reel,
            At graceful glide, or dizzy wheel,
            Till all the dances people know,
              From Cuba's palms to Russia's snow
              Were tried, and soon in every case
              Were mastered with surprising grace.Imagine how they skipped about,
              And how they danced, with laugh and shout![Illustration]

[Illustration]

    No sooner had the Brownies run
    Into the hall than 'twas begun.Some round the harp, with cunning stroke,
    The music in the strings awoke.The violins to others fell,
    Who scraped, and sawed, and fingered well,
    Until the sweet and stirring air
    Would rouse the feet of dullest there.Like people in the spring of life,
    Of joys and countless blessings rife,
    Who yield themselves to Pleasure's hand--
    So danced that night the Brownie Band.First one would take his place to show
    The special step for heel or toe,
    Just how to edge about with care,
    And help around the partner fair,
    Nor plant his feet upon a dress--
    To cause confusion and distress.Then more would play the master's part,
    And give some lessons in the art:

[Illustration]

        Would show the rest some figures new
        From Turkey, China, or Peru.Now smoothly glide, as if on wings,
    Then bob around, as if on springs,
    Until the sprightly steps would call
    Loud acclamations from them all.They danced in twos with skip and bound,
    They danced in circles, round and round;
    They danced in lines that coiled about
    As runs the serpent in and out,
    Some moving slow, some standing still--
    More cutting capers with a will.At length, by joining hand in hand,
    The set included all the band.A happier crowd was never seen
    On ball-room floor or village green.By turns they danced, by turns would go
    And try their skill at string and bow--
    They almost sawed the fiddle through,
    So fast the bow across it flew.And louder still the harp would ring,
    As nimbler fingers plucked the string.Alike they seemed a skillful band
    Upon the floor or music-stand.The night wore on, from hour to hour,
    And still they danced with vim and power;
    For supple-kneed and light of toe
    The Brownies are, as well you know,
    And such a thing as tiring out
    Gives them but small concern, no doubt.As long as darkness hung her pall
    In heavy folds around the hall,
    The Brownies stayed to dance and play,
    Until the very break of day.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    To dance the figures o'er and o'er,
    They lingered on the polished floor;
    No sooner was one party done
    Than others the position won.They chose their partners for the set,
    And bowed, and scraped, and smiling, met.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    As night advanced, and morning gray
    Nigh and still nigher cast its ray,
    The lively Brownies faster flew,
    Across and back, around and through;
    Now down the center, up the side,
    Then back to place with graceful glide--
                  Until it seemed that even day
                  Would hardly drive the band away.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                  At length some, more upon their guard
                  Against surprises, labored hard
    To urge their comrades from the place
    Before the sun would show his face.They pulled and hauled with all their might
    At those half crazy with delight,
                  Who still would struggle for a chance
                  To have, at least, another dance--
                  Some figure that was quite forgot,
                          Although "the finest of the lot."Another wished to linger still--
                          In spite of warning words--until
                          Each member present on the floor
                          Had been his partner twice or more.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                Meantime, outside, the tell-tale dyes
                Of morn began to paint the skies,
                And, one by one, the stars of night
                Grew pale before the morning's light.Alone, bright Venus, in the west,
                Upheld her torch and warned the rest;
                While from the hedge the piping note
                Of waking birds began to float;
    And crows upon the wooded hills
    Commenced to stir and whet their bills,
    When Brownies scampered from the place,
    And undertook the homeward race.Nor made a halt in street or square,
    Or verdant park, however fair;
    But farther from the sight of man
    And light of day, they quickly ran.They traveled at their highest speed,
    And swiftly must they go, indeed;
    For, like the spokes of some great wheel,
    The rays of light began to steal
    Still higher up the eastern sky,
    And showed the sun was rolling nigh.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' CANDY-PULL.[Illustration]

    One evening, while the Brownies sat
    Enjoying free and friendly chat,
    Some on the trees, some on the ground,
    And others perched on fences round--
    One Brownie, rising in his place,
    Addressed the band with beaming face.The listeners gathered with delight
    Around the member, bold and bright,
    To hear him tell of scenes he'd spied
    While roaming through the country wide."Last eve," said he, "to shun the blast,
    Behind a cottage fence I passed.While there, I heard a merry rout,
    And as the yard was dark without,
    I crawled along through weeds and grass,
    Through melon-vines and broken glass,
    Until I might, unnoticed, win
    A glimpse of all the sport within.At length, below the window-pane,
                    To reach the sill I stretched in vain;
                    But, thanks to my inquiring mind
                    And sundry bricks, I chanced to find
    The facts I can relate in full
    About that lively candy-pull.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    "An hour or more, I well believe,
    I stood, their actions to perceive,
    With elbows resting on the sill,
    And nose against the window still.I watched them closely at their fun,
    And learned how everything was done.The younger members took the lead,
    And carried on the work with speed.With nimble feet they ran about
    From place to place, with laugh and shout;
    But older heads looked on the while,
    And cheered the youngsters with a smile,
    And gave advice in manner kind
    To guide the inexperienced mind.They placed the sugar in a pot,
    And stirred it round till boiling hot;
    Then rolled and worked it in their hands,
    And stretched it out in shining bands,
    Until it reached across the floor,
    From mantel-piece to kitchen door."These eyes of mine for many a night
    Have not beheld a finer sight.To pull the candy was the part
    Of some who seemed to know the art.The moon had slipped behind the hill,
    And hoarse had grown the whip-poor-will;
    But still, with nose against the pane,
    I kept my place through wind and rain.There, perched upon the shaky pile,
    With bated breath I gazed the while.I watched them with the sharpest sight
    That I might tell the tale aright;
    For all the active youngsters there
    Appeared to have of work their share.Some put fresh sugar in the pot,
    Some kept the fire blazing hot,
    And worked away as best they could
    To keep the stove well filled with wood.Indeed, ourselves, with all our skill,
    At moving here and there at will,
    Would have to 'lively' be and 'tear
    Around' to beat those children there!Some cut it up, more passed it round,
    While others ate it by the pound!"[Illustration]

    At this, a murmur of surprise
    On every side began to rise;
    Then smiles o'er every visage flitted,
    As wide as cheeks and ears permitted,
    That told what train of thought had sped
    At once through every Brownie's head--
    A thought of pleasure near at hand
    That well would suit the cunning band.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            The Brownies act without delay
            When new ideas cross their way,
            And soon one raised a finger small
            And close attention gained from all.They crowded near with anxious glance
            To learn what scheme he could advance--
    What methods mention or employ
    To bring about the promised joy.Said he: "A vacant house is near.The owner leaves it every year
    For several months, and pleasure seeks
    On ocean waves or mountain peaks.The range is there against the wall,
            The pots, the pans, the spoons, and all,
            While cans of syrup may be found
            In every grocer's store around.The Brownie must be dull and tame,
            And scarce deserves to bear the name,
            Who will not join with heart and hand
            To carry out a scheme so grand."[Illustration]

    Another cried: "When to his bed
    The sun to-morrow stoops his head,
    Again we'll muster in full force
    And to that building turn our course."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            Next eve they gained the street at last
            That through the silent city passed;
            And soon they paused, their eyes they raised
            And on the vacant mansion gazed.In vain the miser hides his store,
    In vain the merchant bars his door,
    In vain the locksmith changes keys--
    The Brownies enter where they please.Through iron doors, through gates of brass,
    And walls of stone they safely pass,
    And smile to think how soon they can
    Upset the studied schemes of man.Within that house, without delay,
    Behind the guide they worked their way,
    More happy far and full of glee
    Than was the owner, out at sea.The whale, the shark, or fish that flies
    Had less attraction for his eyes
    Than had the shining candy-balls
    For Brownies, swarming through his halls.Soon coal was from the cellar brought
    And kindling wood came, quick as thought;
    Then pots and pans came rattling in
    And syrup sweet, in cans of tin.Just where the syrup had been found
    It matters not.The cunning band was soon possessed
    Of full supplies and of the best;
    Next tablespoons of silver fine
    In every hand appeared to shine,
    And ladles long, of costly ware,
    That had been laid away with care.No sooner was the syrup hot
    Than some around the kettle got,
    And dabbed away in eager haste
    To be the first to get a taste.Then some were scalded when the spoon
    Let fall its contents all too soon,
            And gave the tongue too warm a mess
            To carry without some distress.Then steps were into service brought
            That dancing-masters never taught,
            And smothered cries and swinging hand
            Would wake the wonder of the band.And when the candy boiled until
            It could be pulled and hauled at will,
    Take every shape or twist, and seem
    As free as fancy in a dream,
    The busy, happy-hearted crew
    Enjoyed the moments as they flew.The Brownies in the building stayed
    And candy ate as fast as made.But when at length the brightening sky
    Gave warning they must homeward fly,
    They quickly sought the open air
    And had but little time to spare.The shortest way, as often found,
    Was o'er the roughest piece of ground,
    Where rocks as large as houses lay
    All scattered round in wild array.Some covered o'er with clinging vines,
    Some bearing up gigantic pines,
    Or spreading oaks, that rooted fast,
    For centuries had stood the blast.But over all the rugged ground
    The Brownies passed with lightsome bound,
    Now jumping clear from block to block,
    Now sliding down the shelving rock,
    Or cheering on the lagging kind
    Who here and there would fall behind.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES AND THE LOCOMOTIVE.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                One night the Brownies found their way
                To where some tracks and switches lay,
                And buildings stood, such as are found
    In every town on railroad ground.They moved about from place to place,
    With prying eyes and cautious pace
    They peeped in shops and gained a view,
    Where cars were standing bright and new;
    While others, that had service known,
    And in some crash were overthrown,
    On jack-screws, blocks, and such affairs,
    Were undergoing full repairs.The table that turns end for end
            Its heavy load, without a bend,
            Was next inspected through and through
            And tested by the wondering crew.They scanned the signal-lights with care
            That told the state of switches there,--
            Showed whether tracks kept straight ahead,
            Or simply to some siding led.[Illustration]

                Then round a locomotive strong
                They gathered in an earnest throng,
                Commenting on the style it showed,
                Its strength and speed upon the road.Said one: "That 'pilot' placed before
                Will toss a cow a block or more;
            You'd hardly find a bone intact
            When such a thing her frame has racked--
            Above the fence, and, if you please,
            Above the smoke-stack and the trees
            Will go the horns and heels in air,
            When hoisted by that same affair.""Sometimes it saves," another cried,
            "And throws an object far aside
            That would to powder have been ground,
            If rushing wheels a chance had found.I saw a goat tossed from the track
            And landed on a farmer's stack,
            And though surprised at fate so strange,
            He seemed delighted at the change;
            And lived content, on best of fare,
            Until the farmer found him there."Another said: "We'll have some fun
    And down the road this engine run.The steam is up, as gauges show;
    She's puffing, ready now to go;
    The fireman and the engineer
    Are at their supper, in the rear
    Of yonder shed.I took a peep,
    And found the watchman fast asleep.So now's our time, if we but haste,
    The joys of railway life to taste.I know the engine-driver's art,
    Just how to stop, reverse, and start;
    I've watched them when they little knew
    From every move I knowledge drew;
    We'll not be seen till under way,
    And then, my friends, here let me say,
    The man or beast will something lack
    Who strives to stop us on the track."Then some upon the engine stepped,
    And some upon the pilot crept,
    And more upon the tender found
    A place to sit and look around.And soon away the engine rolled
    At speed 'twas fearful to behold;
    It seemed they ran, where tracks were straight,
    At least at mile-a-minute rate;
    And even where the curves were short
    The engine turned them with a snort
    That made the Brownies' hearts the while
    Rise in their throats, for half a mile.But travelers many dangers run
    On safest roads beneath the sun.They ran through yards, where dogs came out
    To choke with dust that whirled about,
    And so could neither growl nor bark
    Till they had vanished in the dark;
    Some pigs that wandered late at night,
    And neither turned to left nor right,
        But on the crossing held debate
        Who first should squeeze beneath the gate,
        Were helped above the fence to rise
        Ere they had time to squeal surprise,
        And never after cared to stray
        Along the track by night or day.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

        But when a town was just in sight,
        And speed was at its greatest height,--
        Alas!that such a thing should be,--
        An open switch the Brownies see.Then some thought best at once to go
                        Into the weeds and ditch below;
                        But many on the engine stayed
                        And held their grip, though much dismayed.And waited for the shock to fall
                        That would decide the fate of all.In vain reversing tricks were tried,
                        And brakes to every wheel applied;
                        The locomotive forward flew,
                        In spite of all that skill could do.But just as they approached the place
                Where trouble met them face to face,
    Through some arrangement, as it seemed,
    Of which the Brownies never dreamed,
    The automatic switch was closed,
    A safety signal-light exposed,
    And they were free to roll ahead,
    And wait for those who'd leaped in dread;
    Although the end seemed near at hand
    Of every Brownie in the band,
    And darkest heads through horrid fright
    Were in a moment changed to white,
    The injuries indeed were small.A few had suffered from their fall,
    And some were sprained about the toes,
    While more were scraped upon the nose;
    But all were able to succeed
    In climbing to a place with speed,
    And there they stayed until once more
    They passed the heavy round-house door.Then jumping down on every side
    The Brownies scampered off to hide;
    And as they crossed the trestle high
    The sun was creeping up the sky,
    And urged them onward in their race
    To find some safe abiding place.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' FANCY BALL.[Illustration]

    It was the season of the year
    When people, dressed in fancy gear,
    From every quarter hurried down
    And filled the largest halls in town;
    And there to flute and fiddle sweet
    Went through their sets with lively feet.The Brownies were not slow to note
    That fun indeed was now afloat;
    And ere the season passed away,
    Of longest night and shortest day,
    They looked about to find a hall
    Where they could hold their fancy ball.Said one: "A room can soon be found
    Where all the band can troop around;
    But want of costumes, much I fear,
    Will bar our pleasure all the year."My eyes have not been shut of late,--
    Don't show a weak and hopeless mind
    Because your knowledge is confined,--

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    For I'm prepared to take the band
    To costumes, ready to the hand,
    Of every pattern, new or old:
    The kingly robes, with chains of gold,
    The cloak and plume of belted knight,
    The pilgrim's hat and stockings white,
    The dresses for the ladies fair,
    The gems and artificial hair,
    The soldier-suits in blue and red,
    The turban for the Tartar's head,
    All can be found where I will lead,
    If friends are willing to proceed."[Illustration]

    Those knowing best the Brownie way
    Will know there was no long delay,
    Ere to the town he made a break
    With all the Brownies in his wake.It mattered not that roads were long,
    That hills were high or winds were strong;
    Soon robes were found on peg and shelf,
    And each one chose to suit himself.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The costumes, though a world too wide,
    And long enough a pair to hide,
    Were gathered in with skill and care,
    That showed the tailor's art was there.Then out they started for the hall,
    In fancy trappings one and all;
    Some clad like monks in sable gowns;
    And some like kings; and more like clowns;
    And Highlanders, with naked knees;
    And Turks, with turbans like a cheese;
    While many members in the line
    Were dressed like ladies fair and fine,
    And swept along the polished floor
    A train that reached a yard or more.[Illustration]

    By happy chance some laid their hand
    Upon the outfit of a band;
    The horns and trumpets took the lead,
    Supported well by string and reed;
    And violins, that would have made
    A mansion for the rogues that played,
    With flute and clarionet combined
    In music of the gayest kind.In dances wild and strange to see
    They passed the hours in greatest glee;
    Familiar figures all were lost
    In flowing robes that round them tossed;
    And well-known faces hid behind
    Queer masks that quite confused the mind.The queen and clown, a loving pair,
    Enjoyed a light fandango there;
    While solemn monks of gentle heart,
    In jig and scalp-dance took their part.The grand salute, with courteous words,
                The bobbing up and down, like birds,
                The lively skip, the stately glide,
                The double turn, and twist aside
                Were introduced in proper place
                And carried through with ease and grace.So great the pleasure proved to all,
    Too long they tarried in the hall,
    And morning caught them on the fly,
    Ere they could put the garments by!Then dodging out in great dismay,
            By walls and stumps they made their way;
            And not until the evening's shade
            Were costumes in their places laid.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES AND THE TUGBOAT.[Illustration]

    While Brownies strayed along a pier
    To view the shipping lying near,
    A tugboat drew their gaze at last;
    'Twas at a neighboring wharf made fast.Cried one: "See what in black and red
    Below the pilot-house is spread!In honor of the Brownie Band,
    It bears our name in letters grand.Through all the day she's on the go;
    Now with a laden scow in tow,
    And next with barges two or three,
    Then taking out a ship to sea,
    Or through the Narrows steaming round
    In search of vessels homeward bound;
    She's stanch and true from stack to keel,
    And we should highly honored feel."Another said: "An hour ago,
    The men went up to see a show,
    And left the tugboat lying here.The steam is up, our course is clear,
    We'll crowd on board without delay
    And run her up and down the bay.We have indeed a special claim,
    Because she bears the 'Brownie' name.Before the dawn creeps through the east
    We'll know about her speed at least,
    And prove how such a craft behaves
    When cutting through the roughest waves.Behind the wheel I'll take my stand
    And steer her round with skillful hand,
    Now down the river, now around
    The bay, or up the broader sound;
    Throughout the trip I'll keep her clear
    Of all that might awaken fear.When hard-a-port the helm I bring,
    Or starboard make a sudden swing,
    The Band can rest as free from dread
    As if they slept on mossy bed.I something know about the seas,
    I've boxed a compass, if you please,
    And so can steer her east or west,
    Or north or south, as suits me best.Without the aid of twinkling stars
    Or light-house lamps, I'll cross the bars.I know when north winds nip the nose,
    Or sou'-sou'-west the 'pig-wind' blows,
    As hardy sailors call the gale
    That from that quarter strikes the sail."A third replied: "No doubt you're smart
    And understand the pilot's art,
    But more than one a hand should take,
    For all our lives will be at stake.In spite of eyes and ears and hands,
    And all the skill a crew commands,
    How oft collisions crush the keel
    And give the fish a sumptuous meal!Too many rocks around the bay
    Stick up their heads to bar the way.Too many vessels, long and wide,
    At anchor in the channel ride
    For us to show ourselves unwise
    And trust to but one pair of eyes."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Ere long the tugboat swinging clear
    Turned bow to stream and left the pier,
    While many Brownies, young and old,
    From upper deck to lower hold
    Were crowding round in happy vein
    Still striving better views to gain.Some watched the waves around them roll;
    Some stayed below to shovel coal,
    From hand to hand, with pitches strong,
    They passed the rattling loads along.Some at the engine took a place,
    More to the pilot-house would race
    To keep a sharp lookout ahead,
    Or man the wheel as fancy led.But accidents we oft record,
    However well we watch and ward,
    And vessels often go to wreck
    With careful captains on the deck;
    They had mishaps that night, for still,
    In spite of all their care and skill,
    While running straight or turning round
    In river, bay, or broader sound,
    At times they ran upon a rock,
    And startled by the sudden shock
    Some timid Brownies, turning pale,
    Would spring at once across the rail;
    And then, repenting, find all hope
    Of life depended on a rope,
    That willing hands were quick to throw
    And hoist them from the waves below.Sometimes too near a ship they ran
    For peace of mind; again, their plan
    Would come to naught through lengthy tow
    Of barges passing to and fro.The painted buoys around the bay
    At times occasioned some dismay--
    They took them for torpedoes dread
    That might the boat in fragments spread,
    Awake the city's slumbering crowds,
    And hoist the band among the clouds.But thus, till hints of dawn appeared
    Now here, now there, the boat was steered
    With many joys and many fears,
    That some will bear in mind for years;
    But at her pier once more she lay
    When night gave place to creeping day.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' TALLY-HO.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    As shades of evening closed around,
        The Brownies, from some wooded ground,
        Looked out to view with staring eye
        A Tally-Ho, then passing by.Around the park they saw it roll,
    Now sweeping round a wooded knoll,
    Now rumbling o'er an arching bridge,
    Now hid behind a rocky ridge,
    Now wheeling out again in view
    To whirl along some avenue.They hardly could restrain a shout
    When they observed the grand turnout.The long, brass horn, that trilled so loud,
    The prancing horses, and the crowd
                    Of people perched so high in air
                    Pleased every wondering Brownie there.Said one: "A rig like this we see
    Would suit the Brownies to a T!And I'm the one, here let me say,
    To put such pleasures in our way:
    I know the very place to go
    To-night to find a Tally-Ho.It never yet has borne a load
                    Of happy hearts along the road;
                    But, bright and new in every part
                    'Tis ready for an early start.The horses in the stable stand
                    With harness ready for the hand;
                    If all agree, we'll take a ride
                    For miles across the country wide."Another said: "The plan is fine;
                    You well deserve to head the line;
                    But, on the road, the reins I'll draw;
    I know the way to 'gee' and 'haw,'
    And how to turn a corner round,
    And still keep wheels upon the ground."Another answered: "No, my friend,
    We'll not on one alone depend;
    But three or four the reins will hold,
                    That horses may be well controlled.The curves are short, the hills are steep,
                    The horses fast, and ditches deep,
                    And at some places half the band
                    May have to take the lines in hand."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    That night, according to their plan,
    The Brownies to the stable ran;
    Through swamps they cut to reach the place,
    And cleared the fences in their race
      As lightly as the swallow flies
        To catch its morning meal supplies.Though, in the race, some clothes were soiled,
            And stylish shoes completely spoiled,
    Across the roughest hill or rock
    They scampered like a frightened flock,
    Now o'er inclosures knee and knee,
    With equal speed they clambered free
    And soon with faces all aglow
    They crowded round the Tally-Ho;
    But little time they stood to stare
    Or smile upon the strange affair.As many hands make labor light,
    And active fingers win the fight,
    Each busy Brownie played his part,
    And soon 't was ready for the start.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    But ere they took their seats to ride
    By more than one the horns were tried,
    Each striving with tremendous strain
    The most enlivening sound to gain,
    And prove he had a special right
    To blow the horn throughout the night.[Illustration]

    Though some were crowded in a seat,
    And some were forced to keep their feet
    Or sit upon another's lap,
    And some were hanging to a strap,
    With merry laugh and ringing shout,
    And tooting horns, they drove about.A dozen miles, perhaps, or more,
    The lively band had traveled o'er,
    Commenting on their happy lot
    And keeping horses on the trot,
    When, as they passed a stunted oak
    A wheel was caught, the axle broke![Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then some went out with sudden pitch,
    And some were tumbled in the ditch,
    And one jumped off to save his neck,
    While others still hung to the wreck.Confusion reigned, for coats were rent,
    And hats were crushed, and horns were bent,
    And what began with fun and clatter
    Had turned to quite a serious matter.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                        Some blamed the drivers, others thought
                        The tooting horns the trouble brought.More said, that they small wisdom showed,
                        Who left the root so near the road.But while they talked about their plight
                        Upon them burst the morning light
                        With all the grandeur and the sheen
                          That June could lavish on the scene.So hitching horses where they could,
                                  The Brownies scampered for the wood.And lucky were the Brownies spry:
                                  A dark and deep ravine was nigh
                                  That seemed to swallow them alive
    So quick were they to jump and dive,
    To safely hide from blazing day
    That fast had driven night away,
    And forced them to leave all repairs
    To other heads and hands than theirs.THE BROWNIES ON

[Illustration]

THE RACE-TRACK.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    While Brownies moved around one night
                    A seaside race-track came in sight."'T is here," said one, "the finest breed
                    Of horses often show their speed;
                    Here, neck and neck, and nose and nose,
                    Beneath the jockeys' urging blows,
                    They sweep around the level mile
                    The people shouting all the while;
    And climbing up or crowding through
    To gain a better point of view,
    So they can see beyond a doubt
    How favorites are holding out."Another said: "I know the place
    Where horses wait to-morrow's race;
    We'll strap the saddles on their back,
    And lead them out upon the track.Then some will act the jockey's part,
    And some, as judges, watch the start,
    And drop the crimson flag to show
    The start is fair and all must go."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Ere long, the Brownies turned to haul
    Each wondering race-horse from his stall.They bridled them without delay,
        And saddles strapped in proper way.Some restless horses rearing there
        Would toss their holders high in air,
        And test the courage and the art
        Of those who took an active part.Said one: "I've lurked in yonder wood,
          And watched the races when I could.I know how all is done with care
              When thus for racing they prepare;
                How every buckle must be tight,
                And every strap and stirrup right,
    Or jockeys would be on the ground
    Before they circled half way round."When all was ready for the show
    Each Brownie rogue was nowise slow
    At climbing up to take a place
    And be a jockey in the race.Full half a dozen Brownies tried
    Upon one saddle now to ride;
    But some were into service pressed
    As judges to control the rest--
    To see that rules were kept complete,
    And then decide who won the heat.A dozen times they tried to start;
    Some shot ahead like jockeys smart,
    And were prepared to take the lead
    Around the track at flying speed.But others were so far behind,
    On horses of unruly mind,
    The judges from the stand declare
    The start was anything but fair.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

        So back they'd jog at his command,
        In better shape to pass the stand.Indeed it was no simple trick
        To ride those horses, shy and quick,
        And only for the mystic art
        That is the Brownies' special part,
    A dozen backs, at least, had found
    A resting-place upon the ground.The rules of racing were not quite
    Observed in full upon that night.Around and round the track they flew,
    In spite of all the judge could do.The race, he tried to let them know,
    Had been decided long ago.But still the horses kept the track,
    With Brownies clinging to each back.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            Some racers of the jumping kind
            At times disturbed the riders' mind
            When from the track they sudden wheeled,
            And over fences took the field,
            As if they hoped in some such mode
            To rid themselves of half their load.But horses, howsoever smart,
        Are not a match for Brownie art,
    For still the riders stuck through all,
    In spite of fence, or ditch, or wall.Some clung to saddle, some to mane,
    While others tugged at bridle rein.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    So all the steeds found it would pay
    To let the Brownies have their way,
    Until a glimpse of rising sun
    Soon made them leave the place and run.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' BIRTHDAY DINNER.[Illustration]

    When people through the county planned
    To give their public dinners grand,
    The Brownies met at day's decline
    To have a birthday banquet fine."The proper things," a speaker cried,
    "Await us here on every side;
    We simply have to reach and take
    And choose a place to boil and bake.With meal and flour at our feet,
    And wells of water pure and sweet,
    That Brownie must be dull indeed
    Who lacks the gumption to proceed.We'll peel the pumpkins, ripened well,
    And scoop them hollow, like a shell,
    Then slice them up the proper size
    To make at length those famous pies,
    For which the people, small and great,
    Are ever quick to reach a plate."[Illustration]

    This pleased them all; so none were slow
    In finding work at which to go.A stove that chance threw in their way
    Was put in shape without delay.Though doors were cracked, and legs were rare,
                    The spacious oven still was there,
                    Where pies and cakes and puddings wide
                    Might bake together side by side.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

              The level top, though incomplete,
              Gave pots and pans a welcome seat,
              Where stews could steam and dumplings found
              A fitting place to roll around.Some lengths of pipe were raised on high
    That made the soot and cinders fly,
    And caused a draught throughout the wreck
    That door or damper failed to check.The rogues who undertook the part,
              That tries the cook's delightful art,
              Had smarting hands and faces red
              Before the table-cloth was spread;
                      But what cared they at such an hour
                      For singeing flame or scalding shower?Such ills are always reckoned slight
                      When great successes are in sight.There cakes and tarts and cookies fine,
                      Of both the "leaf" and "notched" design,
                      Were ranged in rows around the pan
                    That into heated ovens ran;
                    Where, in what seemed a minute's space,
                    Another batch would take their place;
                    While birds, that had secured repose
                    Above the reach of Reynard's nose,
                    Without the aid of wings came down
                    To be at midnight roasted brown.They found some boards and benches laid
                    Aside by workmen at their trade,
                    And these upon the green were placed
                    By willing hands with proper haste.Said one, who board and bench combined:
                    "All art is not to cooks confined,
                    And some expertness we can show
                    As well as those who mix the dough."And all was as the speaker said;
                In fact, they were some points ahead;
              For when the cooks their triumphs showed,
            The table waited for its load.The knives and forks and dishes white
        By secret methods came to light.Much space would be required to tell
    Just how the table looked so well;
    But kitchen cupboards, three or four,
    Must there have yielded up their store;
    For all the guests on every side
    With full equipments were supplied.When people find a carver hacked,
    A saucer chipped, or platter cracked,
    They should be somewhat slow to claim
    That servants are the ones to blame;
        For Brownies may have used the ware
      And failed to show the proper care.[Illustration]

     A few, as waiters, passed about
    New dishes when the old gave out,
     And saw the plates, as soon as bare,
      Were heaped again with something rare.No member, as you may believe,
        Was anxious such a place to leave,
                Until he had a taste at least
                Of all the dishes in the feast.The Brownies, when they break their fast,
                Will eat as long as viands last,
                And even birds can not depend
                On crumbs or pickings at the end:
                The plates were scraped, the kettles clean,
                And not a morsel to be seen,
                Ere Brownies from that table ran
                To shun the prying eyes of man.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' HALLOW-EVE.[Illustration]

    On Hallow-eve, that night of fun,
     When elves and goblins frisk and run,
       And many games and tricks are tried
         At every pleasant fireside,
        The Brownies halted to survey
       A village that below them lay,
      And wondered as they rested there
    To hear the laughter fill the air
    That from the happy children came
    As they enjoyed some pleasant game.Said one: "What means this merry flow
    That comes so loudly from below,
    Uncommon pleasures must abound
    Where so much laughter can be found."Another said: "Now, by your leave,
    I'll tell you 't is All-Hallow-eve,
    When people meet to have their sport
    At curious games of every sort;
    I know them all from first to last,
    And now, before the night has passed,
    For some convenient place we'll start
    Without delay to play our part."Two dozen mouths commenced to show
    Their teeth in white and even row;
    Two dozen voices cried with speed,
    "The plan is good we're all agreed."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    And in a trice four dozen feet
    Went down the hill with even beat.Without a long or wearying race
    The Brownies soon secured a place
    That answered well in every way
    For all the games they wished to play.There tubs of water could be found,
    By which to stoop or kneel around,
    And strive to bring the pennies out
    That on the bottom slipped about.Then heads were wet and shoulders, too,
    Where some would still the coin pursue,
    And mouth about now here and there
    Without a pause or breath of air
    Until in pride, with joyful cries,
    They held aloft the captured prize.More stood the tempting bait beneath,
    And with a hasty snap of teeth
    The whirling apple thought to claim
    And shun the while the candle's flame,--
    But found that with such pleasure goes
    An eye-brow singed, or blistered nose.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    More named the oats as people do
    To try which hearts are false, which true,
    And on the griddle placed the pair
    To let them part or smoulder there;
    And smiled to see, through woe or weal,
    How often hearts were true as steel.Still others tried to read their fate
    Or fortune in a dish or plate,
    Learn whether they would ever wed,
    Or lead a single life instead;
    Or if their mate would be a blessing,
    Or prove a partner most distressing.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then others in the open air,
    Of fun and frolic had their share;
    Played "hide and seek," and "blindman's buff,"
    And "tag" o'er places smooth or rough,
    And "snap the whip" and "trip the toe,"
    And games that none but Brownies know.As if their lives at stake were placed,
    They jumped around and dodged and raced,
    And tumbled headlong to the ground
    When feet some hard obstruction found;
    At times across the level mead,
    Some proved their special claims to speed,
    And as reward of merit wore
    A wreath of green till sport was o'er.The hours flew past as hours will
    When joys do every moment fill;
    The moon grew weak and said good-night,
    And turned her pallid face from sight;
    Then weakening stars began to fail,
    But still the Brownies kept the vale;
    Full many a time had hours retired
    Much faster than the band desired,
    And pleasure seemed too sweet to lay
    Aside, because of coming day,
      But never yet with greater pain
        Did they behold the crimson stain
          That morning spread along the sky,
            And told them they must homeward fly




THE BROWNIES' [Illustration] FLAG-POLE.[Illustration]

    The Brownies through a village bound,
    Paused in their run to look around,
    And wondered why the central square
    Revealed no flag-pole tall and fair.Said one: "Without delay we'll go
    To woods that stand some miles below.The tall spruce lifts its tapering crest
    So straight and high above the rest,
    We soon can choose a flag-pole there
    To ornament this village square.Then every one a hand will lend
    To trim it off from end to end,
    To peel it smooth and paint it white,
    And hoist it in the square to-night."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then to the woods the Brownies ran
    At once to carry out their plan;
    While some ran here and there with speed
    For implements to serve their need,
    Some rambled through the forest free
    To find the proper kind of tree,
    Then climbed the tree while yet it stood
    To learn if it was sound and good,
                                   Without a flaw, a twist, or bend,
                                   To mar its looks from end to end.When one was found that suited well,
                                   To work the active Brownies fell;
      And soon with sticks beneath their load,
      The band in grand procession strode;
        It gave them quite enough to do
        To safely put the project through,
        But when they reached the square, at last,
        Some ropes around the pole were passed
        And from the tops of maples tall
        A crowd began to pull and haul,
        While others gathered at the base
        Until the flag-pole stood in place.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    For Brownies seldom idle stand
    When there is fun or work on hand.At night when darkness wraps us round
    They come from secret haunts profound,
    With brushes, pots of paint, and all,
    They clamber over fence and wall;
    And soon on objects here and there
    That hold positions high in air,
    And most attract the human eye,
    The marks of Brownie fingers lie.Sometimes with feet that never tire
    They climb the tall cathedral spire;
    When all the town is still below,
    Save watchmen pacing to and fro,
    By light of moon, and stars alone,
    They dust the marble and the stone,
          And with their brushes, small and great,
          They paint and gild the dial-plate;
          And bring the figures plain in sight
          That all may note Time's rapid flight.And accidents they often know
          While through the heavy works they go,
          Where slowly turning wheels at last
          In bad position hold them fast.But Brownies, notwithstanding all
          The hardships that may them befall,
          Still persevere in every case
          Till morning drives them from the place.And then with happy hearts they fly
          To hide away from human eye.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES ON THE CANAL.[Illustration]

    One night the Brownies stood beside
    A long canal, whose silent tide
    Connected seaboard cities great
    With inland sections of the state.The laden boats, so large and strong,
    Were tied to trees by hawsers long;
    No boatmen stood by helm or oar,
    No mules were tugging on the shore;
    All work on land and water too
    Had been abandoned by the crew.Said one: "We see, without a doubt,
    What some dispute has brought about.Perhaps a strike for greater pay,
    For even rates, or shorter day,
    Has caused the boats to loiter here
    With cargoes costing some one dear.These cabbages so large and round
    Should, long ere this, the dish have found,
    Upon some kitchen-stove or range
    To spread an odor rich and strange;
    Those squashes, too, should not be lost
    By long exposure to the frost,
    When they would prove so great a prize
    To old and young, if baked in pies.And then those pippins, ripe and fair,
    From some fine orchard picked with care,
                    Should not to rot and ruin go,
                    Though work is hard or wages low,
                    When thousands would be glad to stew
                    The smallest apples there in view."[Illustration]

    Another said: "We lack the might
    To set the wrongs of labor right,
    But by the power within us placed
    We'll see that nothing goes to waste.So every hand must be applied
    That boats upon their way may glide."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then some ran here and there with speed
    To find a team to suit their need.A pair of mules, that grazed about
    The grassy banks, were fitted out
                With straps and ropes without delay
                To start the boats upon their way;
                And next some straying goats were found,
                Where in a yard they nibbled round
                Destroying plants of rarest kind
                That owners in the town could find.Soon, taken from their rich repast,
    They found themselves in harness fast;
    Then into active service pressed
    They trod the tow-path with the rest.[Illustration]

    On deck some Brownies took their stand
    To man the helm, or give command,
    And oversee the work; while more
    Stayed with the teams upon the shore.At times the rope would drag along
            And catch on snags or branches long,
                    And cause delays they ill could bear,
                    For little time they had to spare.[Illustration]

            With accidents they often met,
            And some were bruised and more were wet;
            Some tumbled headlong down the hold;
            And some from heaping cargoes rolled.But what care Brownies for a bruise,
            Or garments wet, from hat to shoes,
            When enterprises bold and new
    Must ere the dawn be carried through?If half the band were drenched, no doubt
    The work would still be carried out,
    For extra strength would then be found
    In those who still were safe and sound.was the shout
    They stood and stared or ran about
    Till in the water, heels o'er head,
    Some members of the band were spread.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    A few could swim, and held their own;
    But more went downward like a stone
    Until, without the plummet's aid,
            They learned how deep canals are made.In spite of all the kicks and flings
            That fright at such a moment brings,
    Through lack of art, or weight of fear,
    It looked as if their end was near.The order now to stop the team
    Would pass along with sign and scream,
    And those on land would know by this
    That something startling was amiss;
    And those on board could plainly see
    Unless assistance there could be,
    In shape of ropes and fingers strong,
    There'd be some vacancies, ere long![Illustration]

    By chance a net was to be had,
    That boatmen used for catching shad--
    A gill-net of the strongest kind,
    For heavy catches well designed;
    Few shad against its meshes ran
    But left their bones on some one's pan,
    This bulky thing the active crew
    Far overboard with promptness threw.A hold at once some Brownies found,
    While others in its folds were bound,
    Until like fish in great dismay
    Inside the net they struggling lay.But willing hands were overhead,
    And quickly from the muddy bed
    Where shedder crabs and turtles crawled
    The dripping net was upward hauled,
    With all the Brownies clinging fast,
    Till safe on deck they stood at last.[Illustration]

                    Sometimes a mule fell off the road
                    And in the stream with all its load.Then precious time would be consumed
    Before the trip could be resumed.Thus on they went from mile to mile,
    With many strange mishaps the while,
    But working bravely through the night
    Until the city came in sight.Said one: "Now, thanks to bearded goats
    And patient mules, the heavy boats
    For hours have glided on their way,
    And reached the waters of the bay.But see, the sun's about to show
    His colors to the world below,
    And other birds than those of night
    Begin to take their morning flight.Our time is up; we've done our best;
    The ebbing tide must do the rest;
    Now drifting downward to their pier
    Let barges unassisted steer,
    While we make haste, with nimble feet,
    To find in woods a safe retreat."[Illustration]

[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES IN THE STUDIO.The Brownies once approached in glee
    A slumbering city by the sea."In yonder town," the leader cried,
    "I hear the artist does reside
    Who pictures out, with patient hand,
    The doings of the Brownie band.""I'd freely give," another said,
    "The cap that now protects my head,
    To find the room, where, day by day,
    He shows us at our work or play."A third replied: "Your cap retain
    To shield your poll from snow or rain.His studio is farther down,
    Within a corner-building brown.So follow me a mile or more
    And soon we'll reach the office door."[Illustration]

    Then through the park, around the square,
    And down the broadest thoroughfare,
    The anxious Brownies quickly passed,
    And reached the building huge at last.[Illustration]

        They paused awhile to view the sight,
        To speak about its age and height,
        And read the signs, so long and wide,
        That met the gaze on every side.But little time was wasted there,
                For soon their feet had found the stair.And next the room, where oft are told
                Their funny actions, free and bold,
                Was honored by a friendly call
                From all the Brownies, great and small.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                Then what a gallery they found,
                As here and there they moved around--
                For now they gaze upon a scene
                That showed them sporting on the green;
                Then, hastening o'er the fields with speed
                To help some farmer in his need.Said one, "Upon this desk, no doubt,
                Where now we cluster round about,
                Our doings have been plainly told
    From month to month, through heat and cold.And there's the ink, I apprehend,
    On which our very lives depend.Be careful, moving to and fro,
    Lest we upset it as we go.For who can tell what tales untold
            That darksome liquid may unfold!"[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            A telephone gave great delight
            To those who tried it half the night,
            Some asking after fresh supplies;
    Or if their stocks were on the rise;
    What ship was safe; what bank was firm;
    Or who desired a second term.Thus messages ran to and fro
    With "Who are you?"And all the repetitions known
    To those who use the telephone.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    "Oh, here's the pen, as I opine,"
    Said one, "that's written every line;
    Indebted to this pen are we
    For all our fame and history.""See here," another said, "I've found
    The pointed pencil, long and round,
    That pictures all our looks so wise,
            Our smiles so broad and staring eyes;
            'Tis well it draws us all aright,
            Or we might bear it off to-night.But glad are we to have our name
            In every region known to fame,
            To know that children lisp our praise,
            And on our faces love to gaze."Old pistols that brave service knew
    At Bunker Hill, were brought to view
    In mimic duels on the floor,
    And snapped at paces three or four;
    While from the foils the Brownies plied,
    The sparks in showers scattered wide,
    As thrust and parry, cut and guard,
    In swift succession followed hard.The British and Mongolian slash
    Were tried in turn with brilliant dash,
    Till foils, and skill, and temper too,
    Were amply tested through and through.[Illustration]

    They found old shields that bore the dint
    Of spears and arrow-heads of flint,
    And held them up in proper pose;
    Then rained upon them Spartan blows.[Illustration]

    Lay figures, draped in ancient styles,
    From some drew graceful bows and smiles,
    Until the laugh of comrades nigh
    Led them to look with sharper eye.A portrait now they criticize,
    Which every one could recognize:
    The features, garments, and the style,
    Soon brought to every face a smile.Some tried a hand at painting there,
    And showed their skill was something rare;
    While others talked and rummaged through
    The desk to find the stories new,
    That told about some late affair,
    Of which the world was not aware.But pleasure seemed to have the power
    To hasten every passing hour,
    And bring too soon the morning chime,
    However well they note the time.Now, from a chapel's brazen bell,
    The startling hint of morning fell,
    And Brownies realized the need
    Of leaving for their haunts with speed.So down the staircase to the street
    They made their way with nimble feet,
    And ere the sun could show his face,
    The band had reached a hiding-place.While the regiment was rallying after the charge, the enemy opened on it a
fierce fire from all kinds of guns--field and siege--which, however, did
but little damage, as the regiment was screened from the enemy's sight by
a dense woods.I at once sent notification to General Custer and Colonel
Pennington of my success, moved forward--my advance busily
skirmishing--and followed with the regiment in line of battle, mounted.The advance was soon checked by the enemy formed behind hastily
constructed intrenchments in a dense wood of the second growth of pine.Flushed with success and eager to gain the Lynchburg pike, along which
immense wagon and siege trains were rapidly moving, the regiment was
ordered to charge.Three times did it try to break through the enemy's
lines, but failed.Colonel Pennington arrived on the field with the rest
of the brigade, when, altogether, a rush was made, but it failed.Then
Custer, with the whole division, tried it, but he, too, failed.Charge and
charge again, was now the order, but it was done in driblets, without
organization and in great disorder.General Custer was here, there, and
everywhere, urging the men forward with cheers and oaths.The great prize
was so nearly in his grasp that it seemed a pity to lose it; but the rebel
infantry held on hard and fast, while his artillery belched out death and
destruction on every side of us.Merritt and night were fast coming on, so
as soon as a force, however small, was organized, it was hurled forward,
only to recoil in confusion and loss.Confident that this mode of fighting
would not bring us success, and fearful lest the enemy should assume the
offensive, which, in our disorganized state, must result in disaster, I
went to General Custer soon after dark, and said to him that if he would
let me get my regiment together, I could break through the rebel line.He
excitedly replied, "Never mind your regiment; take anything and everything
you can find, horse-holders and all, and break through: we must get hold
of the pike to-night."Acting on this order, a force was soon organized by
me, composed chiefly of the Second New York, but in part of other
regiments, undistinguishable in the darkness.With this I made a charge
down a narrow lane, which led to an open field where the rebel artillery
was posted.As the charging column debouched from the woods, six bright
lights suddenly flashed directly before us.A toronado of canister-shot
swept over our heads, and the next instant we were in the battery.The
line was broken, and the enemy routed.Custer, with the whole division,
now pressed through the gap pell-mell, in hot pursuit, halting for neither
prisoners nor guns, until the road to Lynchburg, crowded with wagons and
artillery, was in our possession.We then turned short to the right and
headed for the Appomattox Court House; but just before reaching it we
discovered the thousands of camp fires of the rebel army, and the pursuit
was checked.The enemy had gone into camp, in fancied security that his
route to Lynchburg was still open before him; and he little dreamed that
our cavalry had planted itself directly across his path, until some of our
men dashed into Appomattox Court House, where, unfortunately, Lieutenant
Colonel Root, of the Fifteenth New York Cavalry, was instantly killed by a
picket guard.After we had seized the road, we were joined by other
divisions of the cavalry corps which came to our assistance, but too late
to take part in the fight.Owing to the night attack, our regiments were so mixed up that it took
hours to reorganize them.When this was effected, we marched near to the
railroad station and bivouacked.We threw ourselves on the ground
to rest, but not to sleep.We knew that the infantry was hastening to our
assistance, but unless they joined us before sunrise, our cavalry line
would be brushed away, and the rebels would escape after all our hard work
to head them off from Lynchburg.About daybreak I was aroused by loud
hurrahs, and was told that Ord's corps was coming up rapidly, and forming
in rear of our cavalry.Soon after we were in the saddle and moving
towards the Appomattox Court House road, where the firing was growing
lively; but suddenly our direction was changed, and the whole cavalry
corps rode at a gallop to the right of our line, passing between the
position of the rebels and the rapidly forming masses of our infantry, who
greeted us with cheers and shouts of joy as we galloped along their front.At several places we had to "run the gauntlet" of fire from the enemy's
guns posted around the Court House, but this only added to the interest
of the scene, for we felt it to be the last expiring effort of the enemy
to put on a bold front; we knew that we had them this time, and that at
last Lee's proud army of Northern Virginia was at our mercy.While moving
at almost a charging gait we were suddenly brought to a halt by reports of
a surrender.General Sheridan and his staff rode up, and left in hot haste
for the Court House; but just after leaving us, they were fired into by a
party of rebel cavalry, who also opened fire on us, to which we promptly
replied, and soon put them to flight.Our lines were then formed for a
charge on the rebel infantry; but while the bugles were sounding the
charge, an officer with a white flag rode out from the rebel lines, and we
halted.It was fortunate for us that we halted when we did, for had we
charged we would have been swept into eternity, as directly in our front
was a creek, on the other side of which was a rebel brigade, entrenched,
with batteries in position, the guns double shotted with canister.To have
charged this formidable array, mounted, would have resulted in almost
total annihilation.After we had halted, we were informed that
preliminaries were being arranged for the surrender of Lee's whole army.At this news, cheer after cheer rent the air for a few moments, when soon
all became as quiet as if nothing unusual had occurred.I rode forward
between the lines with Custer and Pennington, and met several old friends
among the rebels, who came out to see us.Among them, I remember Lee
(Gimlet), of Virginia, and Cowan, of North Carolina.I saw General Cadmus
Wilcox just across the creek, walking to and fro with his eyes on the
ground, just as was his wont when he was instructor at West Point.I
called to him, but he paid no attention, except to glance at me in a
hostile manner.While we were thus discussing the probable terms of the surrender, General
Lee, in full uniform, accompanied by one of his staff, and General
Babcock, of General Grant's staff, rode from the Court House towards our
lines.As he passed us, we all raised our caps in salute, which he
gracefully returned.Later in the day loud and continuous cheering was heard among the rebels,
which was taken up and echoed by our lines until the air was rent with
cheers, when all as suddenly subsided.The surrender was a fixed fact, and
the rebels were overjoyed at the very liberal terms they had received.Our
men, without arms, approached the rebel lines, and divided their rations
with the half-starved foe, and engaged in quiet, friendly conversation.There was no bluster nor braggadocia,--nothing but quiet contentment that
the rebellion was crushed, and the war ended.In fact, many of the rebels
seemed as much pleased as we were.Now and then one would meet a surly,
dissatisfied look; but, as a general thing, we met smiling faces and hands
eager and ready to grasp our own, especially if they contained anything to
eat or drink.After the surrender, I rode over to the Court House with
Colonel Pennington and others and visited the house in which the surrender
had taken place, in search of some memento of the occasion.We found that
everything had been appropriated before our arrival.Wilmer McLean, in
whose house the surrender took place, informed us that on his farm at
Manassas the first battle of Bull Run was fought.I asked him to write his
name in my diary, for which, much to his surprise.Others did the same, and I was told that he thus received quite a golden
harvest.While all of the regiments of the division shared largely in the glories
of these two days, none excelled the Second New York Cavalry in its record
of great and glorious deeds.Well might its officers and men carry their
heads high, and feel elated with pride as they received the
congratulations and commendations showered on them from all sides.They
felt they had done their duty, and given the "tottering giant" a blow that
laid him prostrate at their feet, never, it is to be hoped, to rise again.The plan for the battle which he adopted on the
night of July 18th was, according to General Sherman, one of the best
formed during the entire war.But it failed because, even before he began
his attack, Johnston with a good part of his troops had already joined
Beauregard at Manassas.After the defeat McDowell was placed in charge of
the defenses of Washington on the Virginia side of the Potomac.This
picture was taken the next year at General Robert E. Lee's former home in
Arlington.[Illustration: G. T. Beauregard

THE SOUTHERNER OF THE HOUR IN '61.Born in New Orleans on May 28, 1818, the Southern leader upon whom at
first all eyes were turned, Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard, was
graduated from the U. S. Military Academy in 1838.Gallant and dashing, he
won the brevets of Captain and Major in the war with Mexico and was
wounded at Chapultepec.Early in '61 he resigned from the army, and joined
the Confederacy, being in command of the Confederate forces in the firing
on Fort Sumter in April.Owing to his forceful personality, he became a
popular and noted leader in the Confederacy.After the Union defeat at
Manassas, he was looked upon as the coming Napoleon.He was confirmed as
Major-General in the Confederate army on July 30, 1861, but he had held
the provisional rank of Brigadier-General since February 20th, before a
shot was fired.After his promotion to Major-General, he commanded the
Army of the Mississippi under General A. S. Johnston, whom he succeeded at
Shiloh.He defended Charleston, S. C., in 1862-3 and afterward commanded
the Department of North Carolina and Southeastern Virginia.He died at New
Orleans in 1893.[Illustration: ONE OF THE FIRST UNION VOLUNTEER REGIMENTS.]The First Minnesota, a regiment that fought in the flanking column at Bull

Government received an offer of a volunteer regiment from Minnesota, and
on April 29, the First Minnesota was mustered into service by Lieutenant
W. W. Sanders, U. S. A. Under Colonel William O. Gorman the regiment
proceeded to Washington in June and, attached to Franklin's Brigade,
Heintzelman's Division of McDowell's Army, at Bull Run gave an excellent
account of itself, finally retiring from the field in good order.A record
for conspicuous bravery was sustained by the First Minnesota throughout
the war, notably its famous charge on the field of Gettysburg, July 2,

THE OLD CAPITOL PRISON

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Rose O'Neal Greenhow, a zealous and trusted friend of the
Confederacy, lived in Washington at the opening of the war.It was she
who, on July 16, 1861, sent the famous cipher message to Beauregard,
"Order issued for McDowell to move on Manassas to-night."Acting on this,
Beauregard promptly arranged his army for the expected attack, while
Johnston and "Stonewall" Jackson hastened from the Valley to aid in
repelling the Federal advance.Greenhow's secret-service work was cut
short on August 26th, when Allan Pinkerton, the Federal detective,
arrested her and put her under military guard at her home, 398 Sixteenth
Street.Afterward she was transferred to the Old Capitol Prison.She
remained there until April, 1862.On June 2nd, after pledging her word not
to come north of the Potomac until the war was over, Mrs.Greenhow was
escorted beyond the lines of the Union army and set at liberty.It was
later discovered that she had, even while in prison, corresponded
extensively with Colonel Thomas Jordan, of General Beauregard's staff.[Illustration: TROOPS THAT FOUGHT AT BULL RUN--A THREE MONTHS' COMPANY.]When Lincoln issued his call for volunteers on the evacuation of Sumter,

the famous first battle of the war, the regiment was in Burnside's Brigade
of Hunter's Division, which marched some miles to the north, crossed Bull
Run at Sudley Ford, met the Confederates north of Young's Branch, and
drove them south across the stream to the Henry house plateau.Later it
yielded to the panic which seized upon the Union army.On August 2, 1861,
Company "D" closed its brief career in the conflict that was to fill four
years with continuous combat.[Illustration: THE FOURTH NEW JERSEY ON THE BANKS OF THE POTOMAC, 1861

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]THE RAW MATERIAL

The faces of these untried soldiers from New Jersey and Vermont show the
enthusiasm with which men flocked from every state to form an army for the
Union.Nor was that enthusiasm chilled by the long tedious unfamiliar
beating into shape that McClellan was giving them in '61.War's tedious
rudiments had to be learned, but when the time came for fighting, fighting
qualities were not lacking and our citizen soldiers gave an account of
themselves that startled the world.The Green Mountain Boys that first
came to Washington were among the troops that made the first warlike move
from the city to extend the Federal lines into Virginia.It was on these
advanced defences of the Capital that a Green Mountain Boy was found one
night asleep on post.His life was forfeit, but the great heart of Father
Abraham interposed.Lincoln knew the stuff of which these country lads
were made, and this one a few months later on the battlefield nobly laid
down the life he owed to his Commander-in-Chief.Vermont was lavish of her
sons and sent 35,262, nearly 60 per cent.of her male population between
the ages of 18 and 45, to the nation's aid.The State of New Jersey sent
76,814 men, 61.2 per cent.The first raw New
Jersey soldiers in Washington were among the troops that occupied
Arlington Heights, one of the advance positions in the defences.About
one-eighth of New Jersey's troops laid down their lives for their country,
while nearly one-fourth of the Vermonters that went to the War never
returned.[Illustration: THE SIXTH VERMONT AT CAMP GRIFFIN, VIRGINIA

night of July 20, 1861, and long into the morning of the twenty-first
marched lines of hurrying troops.Their blue uniforms were new, their
muskets bright and polished, and though some faces were pale their spirits
were elated, for after their short training they were going to take part,
for the first time, in the great game of war.It was the first move of the
citizen soldier of the North toward actual conflict.Not one knew exactly
what lay before him.The men were mostly from New England and the Middle
States.They had left desk and shop and farm and forge, and with the
thought in their minds that the war would last for three months the
majority had been mustered in.Only the very wise and farseeing had
prophesied the immensity of the struggle, and these were regarded as
extremists.So on they went in long lines
down the road in the darkness of the night, chattering, laughing and
talking carelessly, hardly realizing in the contagion of their patriotic
ardor the grim meaning of real war.The battle had been well planned, but
who had had the experience, even among the leaders, to be sure of the
details and the absolute carrying out of orders?With the exception of the
veterans of the Mexican War, who were regulars, there was not one who had
ever maneuvered a thousand men in the field.A lesson lay before them and
it was soon to come.The surprising battle that opened early in the
morning, and whose results spread such consternation through the North,
was really the result of popular clamor.The press and the politicians
demanded action, and throughout the South the same confident and reckless
spirit prevailed, the same urging to see something done.[Illustration: HERE "STONEWALL" JACKSON WON HIS NAME.]Robinson House, Bull Run.--"Stonewall" Jackson won his name near this

rallied in his rear."Look at Jackson standing there like a stone wall,"
was the sentence that gave birth to his historic nickname.It was General
Bee who uttered these words, just before he fell, adding, "Rally on the
Virginians."[Illustration: WHERE THE CONFEDERATES WAVERED.]Center of Battle of Morning--July 21, 1861.--North of this house, about a

he was driven back at noon to this house in the valley near Young's

south of the stream.General Bee sent for reinforcements, saying that
unless he could be supported "all was lost."[Illustration: AFTER BULL RUN--GUARDING THE PRISONERS.]Inside Castle Pinckney, Charleston Harbor, August, 1861.--In these
hitherto unpublished Confederate photographs we see one of the earliest
volunteer military organizations of South Carolina and some of the first
Federal prisoners taken in the war.The Charleston Zouave Cadets were
organized in the summer of 1860, and were recruited from among the
patriotic young men of Charleston.We see in the picture how very young
they were.The company first went into active service on Morris Island,
January 1, 1861, and was there on the 9th when the guns of the battery
turned back the _Star of the West_ arriving with reinforcements for
Sumter.The company was also stationed on Sullivan's Island during the
bombardment of Sumter, April 12-13, 1861.After the first fateful clash at
Bull Run, July 21, 1861, had taught the North that the war was on in
earnest, a number of Federal prisoners were brought to Charleston and
placed for safe-keeping in Castle Pinckney, then garrisoned by the
Charleston Zouave Cadets.To break the monotony of guard duty Captain
Chichester, some time in August, engaged a photographer to take some
pictures about the fort showing his men.Gray uniforms with red stripes,
red fatigue caps, and white cross belts were a novelty.The casemates of
the fort had been fitted up with bunks and doors as sleeping quarters for
the prisoners.1 was occupied by prisoners from the 11th New
York Zouaves, who had been recruited almost entirely from the New York
Fire Department.The smaller picture is a nearer view of their quarters,
over which they have placed the sign "Hotel de Zouave."We see them still
wearing the uniform of the battlefield: wide dark-blue trousers with socks
covering the bottoms, red flannel shirts with the silver badge of the New
York Fire Department, blue jackets elaborately trimmed with braid, red fez
caps with blue tassels, and a blue sash around the waist.Their regiment,
the famous "Ellsworth's Zouaves," was posted at Bull Run as a support for
Pickett's and Griffin's Batteries during the fierce fighting of the
afternoon on the Henry House hill.They gave way before the charge of the
Confederates, leaving 48 dead and 75 wounded on the field.About 65 of
them were taken prisoners, some of whom we see here a month after the
battle.At the
beginning of the war the possession of prisoners did not mean as much to
the South as it did later in the struggle, when exchanges became almost
the last resource for recruiting the dwindling ranks.Almost every
Southerner capable of bearing arms had already joined the colors.[Illustration: THE PRISONERS--11th NEW YORK ZOUAVES.][Illustration: THE CIVIL WAR SOLDIER AS HE REALLY LOOKED AND MARCHED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]There is nothing to suggest military brilliancy about this squad.Attitudes are as prosaic as uniforms are unpicturesque.The only man
standing with military correctness is the officer at the left-hand end.But this was the material out of which was developed the soldier who could
average sixteen miles a day for weeks on end, and do, on occasion, his
thirty miles through Virginia mud and his forty miles over a hard
Pennsylvania highway.Sixteen miles a day does not seem far to a single
pedestrian, but marching with a regiment bears but little relation to a
solitary stroll along a sunny road.It is a far different matter to trudge
along carrying a heavy burden, choked by the dust kicked up by hundreds of
men tramping along in front, and sweltering in the sun--or trudge still
more drearily along in a pelting rain which added pounds to a soaked and
clinging uniform, and caused the soldiers to slip and stagger in the mud.[Illustration: "RIGHT SHOULDER SHIFT"--COLUMN OF FOURS--THE TWENTY-SECOND

Along this sloping hillside, well suited for a camp, we see a Federal
regiment at its full strength, before bullets and sickness had lowered its
numbers to a mere skeleton of its former self.The band is out in front,
the men are standing at "shoulder arms;" the Colonel and his Major and
Adjutant, mounted on their sleek, well-fed horses, are grouped at one
side, conscious that the eye of the camera is upon them.There is an old
adage among military men that "a straight shot takes the best."When a
freshly joined regiment, recruited to its full strength, reached the army
corps to which it had been assigned and which had been for a long time
actively engaged, it caused comment that well may be understood."Hello,
here comes a new brigade!"cried a veteran of the Potomac who had seen
eight months' continuous service, calling the attention of a companion to
a new regiment just marching into camp.exclaimed the other,
"I'll bet my hat it's a division!"There are instances in plenty where a
company commander found himself at the head of less than a score of men;
where regiments that had started a 1,000 strong could muster but some 200
odd, and where, in a single action, the loss in killed, wounded and
missing was over sixty per cent.We begin to understand
what war is when we stop to think of this.[Illustration: THE BATTLE OF SHILOH._Painted by Paul Wilhelmi._

FORT HENRY AND FORT DONELSON

    By this brilliant and important victory Grant's fame sprang suddenly
    into full and universal recognition.President Lincoln nominated him
    major-general of volunteers, and the Senate at once confirmed the
    appointment.The whole military service felt the inspiriting
    event.--_Nicolay and Hay, in "Life of Lincoln."_


The grasp of a great section of western Kentucky and Tennessee by the
Northern armies, the capture of a stronghold that was thought impregnable,
the forced surrender of a great army, and the bringing into public notice
of a new commander who was destined to outshine all his fellows--these
were the achievements of the short, vigorous campaign of Fort Donelson.There were two great battle-grounds of the Civil War, nearly a thousand
miles apart--Virginia and the valley of the great river that divides the
continent--and the two definite objects of the Northern armies during the
first half of the war period were to capture Richmond and to open the
Mississippi.All other movements and engagements were subordinate to the
dramas of these two great theaters, incidental and contributory.The
South, on the other hand, except for the early threatening of Washington,
the Gettysburg campaign, the raid of Morgan in Ohio, and the expeditions
of Bragg and Hood into Kentucky and Tennessee, was on the defensive from
the beginning of the war to the end.In the East after the initial engagement at Bull Run "all was quiet along
the Potomac" for some months.McClellan had loomed large as the rising
hero of the war; but McClellan did not move with the celerity that was
expected of him; the North became impatient and demanded that something
be done.But while the public was still waiting there were two occurrences
in the West that riveted the attention of the nation, sending a thrill of
gladness through the North and a wave of depression over the Southland.These were the fall of Fort Henry and of Fort Donelson.After Missouri had been saved to the Union in spite of the disaster at
Wilson's Creek in August, 1861, a Union army slowly gathered in southern
Illinois.Its purpose was to dispute with the Confederates their hold on
Kentucky, which had not seceded, and to regain control of the Mississippi.To secure the latter end a flank movement was decided upon--to open the
mighty river by moving up the Cumberland and Tennessee--the greatest
flanking movement in the history of warfare.It began at Fort Henry and
ended at Vicksburg, covered a year and five months, and cost tens of
thousands of human lives and millions of dollars' worth of property--but
it was successful.Eastern Kentucky, in the early days of 1862, was also in considerable
ferment.Colonel James A. Garfield had driven the Confederate commander,
General Humphrey Marshall, and a superior force into the Cumberland
Mountains, after a series of slight encounters, terminating at Paintsville
on the Big Sandy River, on January 10th.But one later event gave great
encouragement to the North.It was the first substantial victory for the
Union arms.General Zollicoffer held the extreme Confederate right at
Cumberland Gap and he now joined General George B. Crittenden near Mill
Springs in central Kentucky.General Buell, in charge of the Army of the
Ohio, had placed General George H. Thomas at Lebanon, and the latter
promptly moved against this threatening Confederate force.A sharp
engagement took place at Logan's Cross Roads near Mill Springs on January
19th.The Confederate army was utterly routed and Zollicoffer was killed.The Union loss was about two hundred and sixty, and the Confederate over
twice that number.It was not a great battle, but its effect on the North
was most stimulating, and the people first learned to appreciate the
abilities of their great general, George H. Thomas.General U. S. Grant was in command of the Union
forces in western Kentucky and Tennessee.The opposing commander was
Albert Sidney Johnston, then reputed the ablest general of the South.At
Bowling Green, Kentucky, he had thirty thousand men.Believing, perhaps,
that he could not hold Kentucky, he determined to save Tennessee for the
South and took his stand at Nashville.On February 2d, 1862, General Grant left Cairo with his army of seventeen
thousand men and on transports moved up the Ohio and the Tennessee to
attack Fort Henry.Accompanying him was Flag-Officer Foote with his fleet
of seven gunboats, four of them ironclads.Fort Henry was garrisoned by an army of about three thousand men under the
command of General Lloyd Tilghman, a brave officer who was destined to
give his life for the Confederate cause, the following year, near
Vicksburg.It covered about three acres and mounted seventeen heavy guns.Grant's plan of attack was to land his army four miles below the fort, to
move across the country and seize the road leading to Fort Donelson, while
Foote should move up the river with his fleet and turn his guns on the
Confederate batteries.On February 6th, Foote formed his vessels into two lines, the
ironclads--the _Cincinnati_, the _Carondelet_, the _Essex_, and the _St.Slowly and cautiously he approached the
fort, firing as he went, the guns on the parapet answering those of the
fleet.The fleet was yet
unhurt when the first hour had passed.Then a 24-pound shot struck the
_Essex_, crashed through her side and penetrated her boiler, instantly
killing both her pilots and flooding the vessel from stem to stern with
scalding steam.The _Essex_, wholly disabled, drifted down stream, while
her companion ships continued their advance and increased their fire.Presently, a sound exceeding the roar of cannon was heard above the
tumult.A great gun in the fort had exploded, killing or disabling every
man who served it.A great 10-inch columbiad was also destroyed.Tilghman,
seeing that he had no hope of holding the fort, decided to save his army
by sending it to Fort Donelson, on the Cumberland River.This he did,
reserving fewer than a hundred men to work the guns.He then raised the
white flag and surrendered the seventy-eight that remained.Grant had
failed to reach the road to Fort Donelson until the Confederates had
escaped.The Southerners hastened across the country and added their
numbers to the defenders of Donelson--and by so doing they deferred
surrender for ten days.Fort Donelson was a fortified enclosure of a hundred acres that crowned a
plateau on the Cumberland River.It was just south of the boundary between
Kentucky and Tennessee and close by the little village of Dover,
consisting of a court-house, a two-story tavern, and a few houses
scattered about.Beneath the bluff and on the river bank were two powerful
batteries commanding the approach to the river.Outside the fort and
stretching far along the ridges that enclosed it were rifle-pits, lines of
logs covered with yellow clay.Farther beyond, the hillsides were covered
with felled trees whose interlacing branches were supposed to render the
approach of the foe impossible under fire.At this moment Donelson was held by eighteen thousand men under the
command of General John B. Floyd, late Secretary of War in the cabinet of
Buchanan.Next to him were Gideon J. Pillow and Simon B. Buckner.The
Union army under Grant was divided into three parts under the respective
commands of Charles F. Smith, a veteran of the regular army; John A.
McClernand, an Illinois lawyer and member of Congress, and Lew Wallace,
the future author of "Ben Hur."With waving banners the divisions of Smith and McClernand marched across
country on February 12th, arriving at noon and encircling the doomed fort
ere nightfall.Smith was stationed on the left and McClernand on the
extreme right, near the village of Dover.This left an open space in the
center, to be filled by Lew Wallace, who arrived with his division the
next day.On the 13th there was a continuous bombardment from morning till
night, punctuated by the sharp crack of the sharpshooter's rifle.The chief action of the day that involved the infantry was an attempt to
capture a battery on a hill, near the center of the Confederate line of
battle, known as Maney's Battery, commanded by Captain Maney, of
Tennessee.This battery had annoyed McClernand greatly, and he delegated
his third brigade to capture it.The charge was led by Colonel Morrison of
Illinois, and a braver one never was made throughout the whole period of
the war.The men who made it were chiefly youths from the farms and
workshops of Illinois.With no apparent thought of danger they sallied
forth, determined at all hazards to capture the battery on the hill, which
stood out in relief against the sky.As they ran up the hill, firing as
they went, their numbers were rapidly thinned by the terrific cross-fire
from this battery and two others on adjoining hills.Still the survivors
pushed on and their deadly fire thinned the ranks of the men at the
battery.At length when they came within forty yards of the goal a long
line of Confederate musketry beside the battery suddenly burst into flame
and a storm of bullets cut down the brave boys of Illinois, with fearful
slaughter.Even then they stood for fifteen minutes, returning volley for
volley, before retreating.Reaching the foot of the hill, they rallied
under the Stars and Stripes, and returned to the assault.Even a third
time they charged, but the dry leaves on the ground now caught fire, the
smoke stifled them, and they had to retreat.As they returned down the
hill, Lew Wallace tells us, "their ears and souls were riven with the
shrieks of their wounded comrades, upon whom the flames crept and
smothered and charred where they lay."That night the river gunboats, six in
number, four of them ironclads, under the command of Andrew H. Foote,
arrived.Grant had sent them down the Tennessee to the Ohio and up the
Cumberland, to support his army at Fort Donelson.On the 14th, about three
in the afternoon, Foote steamed with his four ironclads to a point in the
river within four hundred yards of the two powerful batteries on the river
bank under the fort and opened fire with his cannon while continuing to
advance.The reply from the Confederate batteries was terrific and many of
their shots struck home.In a short time the decks of the vessels were
slippery with human blood.At length a
solid shot struck the pilot house of the flagship and tore away the pilot
wheel.At almost the same moment another gunboat was disabled.The two
vessels, one of which had been struck fifty-nine times, could no longer be
managed; they turned about with the eddies of the river and floated down
with the current.The Confederates raised a wild shout of joy at this, their second victory
since the coming of the Union army.But what will be the story of the
morrow?With the reenforcements brought by Foote, Lew Wallace's division,
Grant's army was now swelled to twenty-seven thousand, and in spite of the
initial repulse the Federals felt confident of ultimate victory.But a
dreary night was before them.All that
fearful night of February 14th there was a fierce, pitiless wind with
driving sleet and snow.Thousands of the men, weary of the burden of their
overcoats and blankets during the warm preceding days, had thrown them
away.Now they spent the night lying behind logs or in ditches or wherever
they could find a little protection from the wintry blasts.General Floyd,
knowing that Grant's army was much stronger than his own, decided, after
consulting with Pillow and Buckner, to attack the Union right at dawn on
the 15th.The night was spent in preparing for this, and in the morning Pillow with
ten thousand men fell upon McClernand, and Buckner soon joined him with an
additional force.Toward noon many of McClernand's men ran short of powder
and he was forced to recede from his position.Pillow seems then to have
lost his head.He felt that the whole Union army was defeated, and though
the road to Nashville was open, the Confederates made no attempt to
escape.He had been absent
all morning down the river consulting Foote, not knowing that the
Confederates had planned an escape.This moment, says Lew Wallace, was the
crisis in the life of Grant.Hearing the disastrous news, his face flushed for a moment; he crushed
some papers in his hand.Next instant he was calm, and said in his
ordinary tone, to McClernand and Wallace, "Gentlemen, the position on the
right must be retaken."In a short
time the Union lines were in motion.General Smith made a grand assault on
the Confederate outworks and rifle-pits.When his lines hesitated Smith
waved his cap on the point of his sword and rode in front, up the hill, in
the hottest fire of the foe, toward the rifle-pits--and they were carried.At the same moment Lew Wallace was leading his division up another <DW72>
with equal gallantry.Here again the Confederates retired, and the road to
Nashville was no longer open.Furthermore, Smith held a position from
which he could shell the fort on the inside, and nothing was left to the
inmates but surrender or slaughter on the morrow.A council was held by Floyd, Pillow, and Buckner.Buckner, who was a
master in the art of warfare, declared that he could not hold his position
for half an hour in the morning.Floyd was
under indictment at Washington for maladministration in the Buchanan
cabinet.He declared that he must not be taken, and that with his
Virginia troops he would escape on two little boats that were to arrive
from Nashville in the morning.He passed the command to Pillow, and
Pillow, declaring that he too would escape, passed it on to Buckner.Floyd
and Pillow with their men made good their escape; so did Colonel Forrest,
the cavalry leader, and his mounted force.In the early morning Buckner sent a note to Grant offering to capitulate.Grant demanded "unconditional surrender," and
added, "I propose to move immediately on your works."Buckner was too good
a soldier to sacrifice his men in needless slaughter.His men were so worn
with eighty-four hours of fighting and watching that many of them had
fallen asleep while standing in battle-line and under fire.He accepted
the "ungenerous and unchivalrous terms," as he pronounced them, and
surrendered Fort Donelson and the army, consisting of at least fourteen
thousand men, with all its stores of ammunition.The Union loss was over
twenty-eight hundred men.The Confederate loss, killed and wounded, was
about two thousand.The capture of Fort Donelson did three things.First, it opened up the way
for the Federal army to penetrate the heart of the western South and gave
it control of Kentucky and of western Tennessee.Second, it electrified
the North with confident hopes of ultimate success.It was the first great
victory for the North in the war.Bull Run had been a moral victory to the
South, but the vanquished were weakened scarcely more than the victors.At
Donelson, the victors gained control of an extensive territory and
captured a noble army which could ill be spared by the South and which
could not be replaced.Third, the capture of Donelson forced before the
nation a new man--Ulysses S. Grant.[Illustration: CAPTAIN CLARK B.WINNING HIS SPURS AT CAIRO.Few will recognize in this early and unusual photograph the man who at

immediate superior, Commander of the Department of the West, Grant pushed
forward a force and occupied Paducah, Kentucky, before the Confederates,
approaching with the same purpose, could arrive.Grant was impatient to
drive back the Confederate lines in Kentucky and Tennessee and began early
to importune Washington to be allowed to carry out maneuvers.His keen
judgment convinced him that these must quickly be made in order to secure
the advantage in this outlying arena of the war.Captain Rawlins was made
Assistant Adjutant-General by Grant, and lifted from his shoulders much of
the routine of the post.Captain Lagow and Captain Hillyer were two of the
General's aides-de-camp.James Simons was Medical Director of the
District.[Illustration: BRIGADIER-GENERAL U. S.[Illustration: CAPTAIN WILLIAM S.[Illustration: CAIRO CITIZENS WHO MAY HAVE RECALLED THIS DAY.]With his hands thrust in his pockets stands General Grant, next to General

Henry.Fighting blood surged in the veins of Commander W. D. Porter, son
of Admiral David Porter and brother of Admiral David D. Porter.The
gunboat which he led into action at Fort Henry was named after the famous
_Essex_ which his father commanded in the War of 1812.Fifteen of the
shots from Fort Henry struck and told upon the _Essex_, the last one
penetrating her armor and piercing her middle boiler.Commander Porter,
standing among his men directing the fight, was terribly scalded by the
escaping steam, as were twenty-seven others.Wrongly suspected of
disloyalty at the outbreak of the war, Commander Porter's conduct during
the struggle gave the lie to such calumny.He recovered after Fort Henry,
and was made Commodore in July, 1862.Again in command of the _Essex_ he
attempted unsuccessfully to destroy the dread Confederate ram _Arkansas_
at Vicksburg on July 22d.Porter and the _Essex_ then joined Farragut's
fleet.His shells helped the Union forces to repulse the Confederates at
Baton Rouge, August 5th, and he witnessed the blowing up of the _Arkansas_
the following day.[Illustration: COMMANDER W. D.[Illustration: THE _ESSEX_ TWO YEARS LATER.][Illustration: THE GUNBOAT THAT FIRED THE FIRST SHOT AT FORT HENRY.]Here, riding at anchor, lies the flagship of Foote, which opened the
attack on Fort Henry in the first movement to break the backbone of the
Confederacy, and won a victory before the arrival of the army.This
gunboat, the _Cincinnati_, was one of the seven flat-bottom ironclads
built by Captain Eads at Carondelet, Missouri, and Mound City, Illinois,
during the latter half of 1861.When Grant finally obtained permission
from General Halleck to advance the attack upon Fort Henry on the
Tennessee River, near the border of Kentucky, Flag Officer Foote started
up the river, February 2, 1862, convoying the transports, loaded with the
advance detachment of Grant's seventeen thousand troops.Arriving before
Fort Henry on February 6th, the intrepid naval commander at once began the
bombardment with a well-aimed shot from the _Cincinnati_.The eleven heavy
guns of the fort responded in chorus, and an iron rain began to fall with
telling effect upon the _Cincinnati_, the _Essex_, the _Carondelet_, and
the _St.Louis_, which were steaming forward half a mile in advance of the
rear division of the squadron.At a range of 1,700 yards the _Cincinnati_
opened the engagement.After a little over an hour of heavy firing the
colors on Fort Henry were lowered and General Tilghman surrendered it to
Flag-Officer Foote.When General Grant arrived an hour later, Foote turned
over the fort to him and returned to Cairo with his disabled gunboats.[Illustration: FLAG-OFFICER FOOTE.]A GALLANT GUNBOAT--THE ST.With the shots from the Confederate batteries ringing and bounding off her
iron plates, this gallant gunboat that Foote had chosen for his flagship,
entered the zone of fire at Fort Donelson.In the confined space of her
smoke-filled gun-deck, the river sailors were loading and firing the heavy
broadsides as fast as the great guns could be run out and aimed at the
frowning line of entrenchments on the river bank.From them the
concentrated hail of iron was poured upon her and the marksmanship was
good.Fifty-nine times was this brave vessel struck.But her armored sides
withstood the heavy shocks although the plating, dented and bent, bore
record of each impact.Nearer and nearer grew the forts as up the narrow
channel the flag-ship led the way, the _Louisville_, the _Carondelet_, and
the _Pittsburgh_ belching their fire at the wooded heights, as though
endeavoring to attract the attention of the Confederate gunners to
themselves and save the flag-ship from receiving more than her share.Up
in the pilot-house the brave man who knew the channel stood at the wheel,
his eyes firmly fixed ahead; and on the "texas," as the upper deck was
called, within speaking distance of him, stood Foote himself.A great
shot, aimed accurately as a minie ball, struck the frail pilot-house.It
was as if the vessel's heart was pierced.The wheel was swept away from
the pilot's hand and the brave river guide was hurled into the corner,
mangled, bleeding and soon to die.He
fell badly wounded in the leg by a fragment of the shell--a wound from
which he never fully recovered.Helpless now, the current swept the _St.Louis'_ bow around, and past her consorts that were still fighting, she
drifted down the stream and out of action; later, in convoy of the
_Louisville_, she returned to Cairo, leaving the _Carondelet_ and
_Pittsburgh_ to escort the transports.Meanwhile on shore, Grant was
earning his first laurels as a soldier in a big battle.The disabling of
the gunboats caused the Confederates to make the fatal attack that
resulted so disastrously for them.Assailing Grant's right wing that held
a strong position, on the 15th of February, 19,000 men were hurled against
a force 8,000 greater in number.Shattered
they retreated to their works, and in the morning of the 16th, the
Confederate general, Buckner, surrendered.About 14,000 prisoners were
taken.The Federal loss was nearly 3,000, and that of the Southern cause
about 1,000 less.For the capture of Fort Donelson Grant was made
major-general.The first step to the conquest of the Mississippi had been
achieved.In October, 1862, the river fleet was transferred from the Army
to the Navy Department, and as there was another vessel in the service,
bearing the same name the _St.Louis_ was renamed the _Baron de Kalb_.At
Fort Henry, she went into action lashed to the _Carondelet_ on account of
the narrowness of the stream; and later again, the gallant gunboat won
laurels at Island No.10, Fort Pillow, Memphis, and Vicksburg.[Illustration: THE FLAG-SHIP _ST.LOUIS_ VIEWED FROM ASTERN.][Illustration: _LOUISVILLE_--A FIGHTER AT THE FORT.][Illustration: THE ADVENTUROUS GUNBOAT _CONESTOGA_.]Lying at anchor in the Ohio River this little wooden gunboat is having the
finishing touches put to her equipment while her officers and men are
impatiently waiting for the opportunity to bring her into action.A
side-wheel river steamer originally, she was purchased at Cincinnati by
Commander John Rodgers in the spring of 1861 and speedily converted into a
gunboat.Her boilers and steam pipes were lowered into the hold and the
oaken bulwarks five inches thick which we see were put on her and pierced
for guns.She got her first taste of fighting when, at Lucas Bend, she
engaged the land batteries and a Confederate gunboat, September 10, 1861.She was present at Fort Henry in the second division of the attacking
fleet, and also at Fort Donelson.[Illustration: THE _TYLER_

moral courage to decide upon a surrender, even when odds are overwhelming,
as it does physical bravery, in maintaining a useless fight to the death.Brigadier-General Tilghman, who commanded the Confederate Fort Henry on
the Tennessee and General Simon Bolivar Buckner in command of the
Confederate Fort Donelson--a much stronger position on the Cumberland only
a few miles away--were men who possessed this kind of courage.Both had
the misfortune to hold untenable positions.Each displayed generalship and
sagacity and only gave up to the inevitable when holding out meant nothing
but wasted slaughter and the sacrifice of men who had been called upon to
exert every human effort.Fort Henry, on the banks of the Tennessee, was
held by a few thousand men and strongly armed with twenty guns including
one 10-inch Columbiad.But on the 6th of February it fairly lay in the
possession of the Federals before a shot had actually been fired, for
Grant with 17,000 men had gained the rear of the fortification after his
move from Cairo on the 30th of the previous month.The actual reduction of
the fort was left to the gunboat flotilla under Flag Officer Foote, whose
heavy bombardment began early in the morning.General Tilghman had seen
from the first that the position could not be held.He was trapped on all
sides, but he would not give way without a display of resistance.Before
the firing began, he had sent off most of the garrison and maintained the
unequal combat with the gunboats for an hour and a quarter with less than
a hundred men, of whom he lost twenty-one.Well did this handful serve the
guns on the river bank.One shot struck the gunboat _Essex_, piercing her
boilers, and wounding and scalding twenty-eight men.But at last,
enveloped on all sides, his retreat cut off--the troops who had been
ordered to depart in the morning, some three thousand in number, had
reached Fort Donelson, twelve miles away--General Tilghman hauled down his
flag, surrendering himself and eighty-four men as prisoners of war.Here
we see him--a brave figure of a man--clad in the uniform of a Southern
Colonel.There was never the slightest doubt of his courage or of his
proper discretion in making this surrender.Only for a short time was he
held a prisoner, when he was exchanged and welcomed back with all honor
into the ranks of the Confederacy, and given an important command.He did
not, however, live long to serve his cause, for shortly after rejoining
the army he was killed at the battle of Baker's Creek, Mississippi, on the
16th of May, 1863.It is not often that on the battlefield ties of friendship are cemented
that last a lifetime, and especially is this so between conqueror and
conquered.Fort Donelson, that was, in a measure, a repetition of Fort
Henry, saw two fighting foes become thus united.It was impossible for the
garrison of Fort Donelson to make its escape after the flotilla of
gunboats had once appeared in the river, although General Floyd, its
senior commander, the former Secretary of War under President Buchanan,
had withdrawn himself from the scene tendering the command to General
Pillow, who in his turn, after escaping with his own brigade, left the
desperate situation to be coped with by General Buckner.Assailed in the
rear by an army that outnumbered the defenders of the fort by nearly eight
thousand and with the formidable gunboats hammering his entrenchments from
the river, Buckner decided to cut his way out in a desperate charge, but
being repulsed, saw his men flung back once more into the fort.There was
nothing for it but to make terms.On February 16th, in a note to Grant he
asked what might be granted him.Here, the coming leader won his nickname
of "Unconditional Surrender" Grant.Buckner was informed that the Federal
army was about to move upon his works.Hurt and smarting under his
position, he sent back a reply that in a few short hours he would,
perhaps, have been willing to recall.Yielding to circumstances he
accepted what he bluntly pronounced, "ungenerous and unchivalrous terms."But when the capitulation had taken place and nearly fifteen thousand men
had surrendered, a greater number than ever before laid down their arms
upon the continent, Grant was so generous, that then and there began the
friendship that grew as close as if the two men were brothers of the
blood.Each one was allowed to retain
his personal baggage, and the officers to keep their side arms.Grant had
known Buckner in the Mexican War, and received him after the battle as his
guest.For a short time General Buckner was kept a prisoner at Fort Warren
until he was exchanged.But the friendship between the two leaders
continued.When General Grant, after having been twice President, failed
in his business career, Buckner sent him a check, trusting that it might
be of use in his time of trouble.Grant, shortly before his death, wrote
his old-time comrade and antagonist requesting that Buckner do him the
final honors by becoming one of his pallbearers.[Illustration: BUCKNER, THE DEFENDER OF DONELSON.]SHILOH--THE FIRST GRAND BATTLE

    No Confederate who fought at Shiloh has ever said that he found any
    point on that bloody field easy to assail.--_Colonel William Preston
    Johnston (Son of the Confederate General, Albert Sidney Johnston,
    killed at Shiloh)._


In the history of America many battles had been fought, but the greatest
of them were skirmishes compared with the gigantic conflicts of the Old
World under Marlborough and Napoleon.On the field of Shiloh, for the
first time, two great American armies were to engage in a mighty struggle
that would measure up to the most important in the annals of Europe.And
the pity of it was that the contestants were brethren of the same
household, not hereditary and unrelenting enemies.At Fort Donelson the western South was not slain--it was only wounded.The
chief commander of that part of the country, Albert Sidney Johnston,
determined to concentrate the scattered forces and to make a desperate
effort to retrieve the disaster of Donelson.He had abandoned Bowling
Green, had given up Nashville, and now decided to collect his troops at
Corinth, Mississippi.Next in command to Johnston was General Beauregard
who fought at Bull Run, and who had come from Virginia to aid Johnston.There also came Braxton Bragg, whose name had become famous through the
laconic expression, "A little more grape, Captain Bragg," uttered by
Zachary Taylor at Buena Vista; Leonidas Polk who, though a graduate of
West Point, had entered the church and for twenty years before the war had
been Episcopal bishop of Louisiana, and John C. Breckinridge, former Vice
President of the United States.The legions of the South were gathered at
Corinth until, by the 1st of April, 1862, they numbered forty thousand.Meantime, the Union army had moved southward and was concentrating at
Pittsburg Landing, on the Tennessee River, an obscure stopping place for
boats in southern Tennessee, and some twenty miles northeast from Corinth.The name means more now than merely a landing place for river craft.It
was clear that two mighty, hostile forces were drawing together and that
ere long there would be a battle of tremendous proportions, such as this
Western hemisphere had not then known.General Grant had no idea that the Confederates would meet him at
Pittsburg Landing.He believed that they would wait for an attack on their
entrenchments at Corinth.The position his army occupied at the Landing
was a kind of quadrilateral, enclosed on three sides by the river and
several small streams that flow into it.As the early days of April passed
there were ominous rumors of the coming storm; but Grant was so sure that
Johnston would not attack that he spent the night of the 5th of April at
Savannah, some miles down the Tennessee River.For two weeks the Union troops had occupied the
undulating tableland that stretched away from the river at the Landing.There was the sound of the plashing streams overflowing from recent rains,
there were revelry and mirth around the thousand camp-fires; but there was
no sound to give warning of the coming of forty thousand men, who had for
two days been drawing nearer with a steady tread, and during this night
were deploying around the Union camp, only a mile away.There was nothing
to indicate that the inevitable clash of arms was but a few hours in the
future.At the dawn of day on Sunday, April 6th, magnificent battle-lines, under
the Confederate battle-flag, emerged from the woods on the neighboring
hills within gunshot of the Federal camps.Whether the Union army was
really surprised has been the subject of long controversy, which we need
not enter.Certainly, the attack on it was most sudden, and in
consequence it fought on the defensive and at a disadvantage throughout
the day.General Hardee's corps, forming the first line of battle, moved against
the outlying division of the Union army, which was commanded by General
Benjamin Prentiss, of West Virginia.Before Prentiss could form his lines
Hardee's shells began bursting around him, but he was soon ready and,
though pressed back for half a mile in the next two or three hours, his
men fought like heroes.Meanwhile the further Confederate advance under
Bragg, Polk, and Breckinridge was extending all along the line in front of
the Federal camps.The second Federal force to encounter the fury of the
oncoming foe was the division of General W. T. Sherman, which was cut to
pieces and disorganized, but only after it had inflicted frightful loss on
the Confederate army.General Grant, as we have noted, spent the night at Savannah, a town nine
miles by way of the river from Pittsburg Landing.As he sat at breakfast,
he heard the distant boom of cannon and he quickly realized that
Johnston's army had attacked his own at the Landing.Instantly he took a
boat and started for the scene of the conflict.At Crump's Landing, about
half way between the two, General Lew Wallace was stationed with a
division of seven thousand men.As Grant passed Crump's Landing, he met
Wallace and ordered him to be ready for instant marching when he was
called for.When Grant arrived at Pittsburg Landing, about eight o'clock
in the morning, he found a tremendous battle raging, and he spent the day
riding from one division commander to another, giving directions and
cheering them on as best he could.About two and a half miles from the Landing stood a little log church
among the trees, in which for years the simple folk of the countryside had
been wont to gather for worship every Sunday morning.But on this fateful
Sunday, the demon of war reigned supreme.The little church was known as
Shiloh to all the country around, and it gave its name to the great battle
that raged near it on that memorable day.General Prentiss had borne the first onset of the morning.He had been
pressed back half a mile.But about nine o'clock, after being reenforced,
he made a stand on a wooded spot with a dense undergrowth, and here he
held his ground for eight long hours, until five in the afternoon, when he
and a large portion of his division were surrounded and compelled to
surrender.Time after time the Confederates rushed upon his position, but
only to be repulsed with fearful slaughter.This spot came to be known as
the "Hornet's Nest."It was not far from here that the Confederates
suffered the irreparable loss of the day.Their noble commander, Albert
Sidney Johnston, received his death wound as he was urging his troops to
force back Hurlbut's men.He was riding in the center of the fight,
cheering his men, when a minie ball cut an artery of his thigh.But he
thought only of victory and continued in the saddle, raising his voice in
encouragement above the din of battle.Presently his voice became faint, a
deadly pallor blanched his cheek.He was lifted from his horse, but it was
too late.In a few minutes the great commander was dead, from loss of
blood.The death of Johnston, in the belief of many, changed the result at Shiloh
and prevented the utter rout or capture of Grant's army.One of Johnston's
subordinates wrote: "Johnston's death was a tremendous catastrophe.Sometimes the hopes of millions of people depend upon one head and one
arm.The West perished with Albert Sidney Johnston and the Southern
country followed."Jefferson Davis afterward declared that "the fortunes
of a country hung by a single thread on the life that was yielded on the
field of Shiloh."Beauregard succeeded to the command on the fall of Johnston and the
carnage continued all the day--till darkness was falling over the valleys
and the hills.The final charge of the evening was made by three
Confederate brigades close to the Landing, in the hope of gaining that
important point.But by means of a battery of many guns on the bluff of
Dill's Branch, aided by the gunboats in the river, the charge was
repulsed.Beauregard then gave orders to desist from further attack all
along his lines, to suspend operations till morning.When General Bragg
heard this he was furious with rage.He had counted on making an immediate
grand assault in the darkness, believing that he could capture a large
part of the Federal army.When the messenger informed him of Beauregard's order, he inquired if he
had already delivered it to the other commanders."If you had not," rejoined the angry Bragg, "I would not obey it.But Bragg's fears were not shared by his compatriots.Further mention is due the two little wooden gunboats, _Tyler_ and
_Lexington_, for their share in the great fight.The _Tyler_ had lain all
day opposite the mouth of Dill's Branch which flowed through a deep,
marshy ravine, into the Tennessee just above the Landing.Her commander,
Lieutenant Gwin, was eager for a part in the battle, and when he saw the
Confederate right pushing its way toward the Landing, he received
permission to open fire.For an hour his guns increased the difficulties
of Jackson's and Chalmers' brigades as they made their way to the
surrounding of Prentiss.Later on the _Lexington_ joined her sister, and
the two vessels gave valuable support to the Union cannon at the edge of
the ravine and to Hurlbut's troops until the contest ended.All that
night, in the downpour of rain, Lieutenant Gwin, at the request of General
Nelson, sent shot crashing through the trees in the direction where the
Confederates had bivouacked.This completely broke the rest of the
exhausted troops, and had a decided effect upon the next day's result.Southern hopes were high at the close of this first bloody day at Shiloh.Whatever of victory there was at the end of the day belonged to the
Confederates.They had pressed the Federals back more than a mile and now
occupied their ground and tents of the night before.They had captured
General Prentiss with some thousands of his men as a result of his brave
stand at the "Hornet's Nest."But their hopes were mingled with grave fears.General Van Dorn with an
army of twenty thousand men was hastening from Arkansas to join the
Confederate forces at Shiloh; but the roads were bad and he was yet far
away.On the other hand, Buell was coming from Nashville to join Grant's
army.Should he arrive during the night, the contest of the next day would
be unequal and the Confederates would risk losing all that they had
gained.Moreover, Beauregard's army, with its long, muddy march from
Corinth and its more than twelve hours' continuous fighting, was worn and
weary almost to exhaustion.The Union army was stunned and bleeding, but not disabled, at the close of
the first day's battle.Caught unawares, the men had made a noble stand.Though pressed back from their position and obliged to huddle for the
night around the Landing, while thousands of their comrades had fallen on
the gory field, they had hopes of heavy reenforcements during the night.And, indeed, early in the evening the cry ran along the Union lines that
Buell's army had come.The advance guard had arrived late in the afternoon
and had assisted Hurlbut in the closing scene on the bluff of Dill's
ravine; others continued to pour in during the night.And, furthermore,
General Lew Wallace's division, though it had taken a wrong road from
Crump's Landing and had not reached the field in time for the fighting of
the 6th, now at last had arrived.Buell and Wallace had brought with them
twenty-five thousand fresh troops to be hurled on the Confederates on the
morning of the 7th.The preponderance of
numbers now was with the Union army.Everyone knew that the battle was not over, that the issue must be
decided on the coming day, and the weary thousands of both sides sank down
on the ground in a drenching rain to get a little rest and to gain a
little strength for the desperate struggle that was sure to come on the
morrow.Beauregard rested hopes upon a fresh dispatch announcing that Buell was
delayed and the dreaded junction of two Federal armies therefore
impossible.Meanwhile Grant and Buell were together in Sherman's camp and
it was decided that Buell's troops should attack Beauregard next morning.One division of Buell stood to arms all night.At the break of day on Monday, April 7th, all was astir in both camps on
the field of Shiloh, and the dawn was greeted with the roar of cannon.The
troops that Grant now advanced into the contest were all, except about ten
thousand, the fresh recruits that Wallace and Buell had brought, while the
Confederates had not a single company that had not been on the ground the
day before.Some military historians believe that Beauregard would have
won a signal victory if neither army had been reenforced during the night.But now under the changed conditions the Confederates were at a great
disadvantage, and yet they fought for eight long hours with heroic valor.The deafening roar of the cannon that characterized the beginning of the
day's battle was followed by the rattle of musketry, so continuous that no
ear could distinguish one shot from another.Nelson's division of Buell's
army was the first to engage the Confederates.Nelson commanded the
Federal left wing, with Hardee and Breckinridge immediately opposed to
him.The Union center was under the command of Generals McCook and
Crittenden; the right wing was commanded by McClernand, with Hurlbut next,
while Sherman and Lew Wallace occupied the extreme right.The Confederate
left wing was commanded by the doughty Bragg and next to him was General
Polk.Shiloh Church was again the storm center and in it General Beauregard
made his headquarters.Hour after hour the columns in blue and gray surged
to and fro, first one then the other gaining the advantage and presently
losing it.At times the smoke of burning powder enveloped the whole field
and hid both armies from view.The interesting incidents of this day of
blood would fill a volume.General Hindman of the Southern side had a
novel experience.His horse was struck by a bursting shell and torn to a
thousand fragments.The general, thrown ten feet high, fell to the ground,
but leaped to his feet unhurt and asked for another horse.Early in the afternoon, Beauregard became convinced that he was fighting a
losing battle and that it would be the part of prudence to withdraw the
army before losing all.He thereupon sent the members of his staff to the
various corps commanders ordering them to prepare to retreat from the
field, at the same time making a show of resuming the offensive.The
retreat was so skilfully made, the front firing-line being kept intact,
that the Federals did not suspect it for some time.Some hours before
nightfall the fighting had ceased.The Federals remained in possession of
the field and the Confederates were wading through the mud on the road to
Corinth.It was a dreary march for the bleeding and battered Confederate army.An
eye-witness described it in the following language:

"I made a detour from the road on which the army was retreating that I
might travel faster and get ahead of the main body.In this ride of twelve
miles alongside of the routed army, I saw more of human agony and woe than
I trust I will ever again be called upon to witness.The retreating host
wound along a narrow and almost impassable road, extending some seven or
eight miles in length.Here was a line of wagons loaded with wounded,
piled in like bags of grain, groaning and cursing; while the mules plunged
on in mud and water belly-deep, the water sometimes coming into the
wagons.Next came a straggling regiment of infantry, pressing on past the
wagons; then a stretcher borne on the shoulders of four men, carrying a
wounded officer; then soldiers staggering along, with an arm broken and
hanging down, or other fearful wounds, which were enough to destroy life.And, to add to the horrors of the scene, the elements of heaven marshaled
their forces--a fitting accompaniment of the tempest of human desolation
and passion which was raging.A cold, drizzling rain commenced about
nightfall, and soon came harder and faster, then turned to pitiless,
blinding hail.I passed
long wagon trains filled with wounded and dying soldiers, without even a
blanket to shelter them from the driving sleet and hail, which fell in
stones as large as partridge eggs, until it lay on the ground two inches
deep."Some three hundred men died during that awful retreat, and their bodies
were thrown out to make room for others who, although wounded, had
struggled on through the storm, hoping to find shelter, rest, and medical
care."Four days after the battle, however, Beauregard reported to his
government, "this army is more confident of ultimate success than before
its encounter with the enemy."Addressing the soldiers, he said: "You have
done your duty.... Your countrymen are proud of your deeds on the bloody
field of Shiloh; confident in the ultimate result of your valor."The news of these two fearful days at Shiloh was astounding to the
American people.Never before on the continent had there been anything
approaching it.Bull Run was a skirmish in comparison with this gigantic
conflict.The losses on each side exceeded ten thousand men.General Grant
tells us that after the second day he saw an open field so covered with
dead that it would have been possible to walk across it in any direction
stepping on dead bodies, without a foot touching the ground.American
valor was tried to the full on both sides at Shiloh, and the record shows
that it was equal to the test.[Illustration: GENERAL A. S. JOHNSTON, C. S.A brilliant Southern leader, whose early loss was a hard blow to the
Confederacy, Albert Sidney Johnston was a born fighter with a natural
genius for war.A West Pointer of the Class of '26, he had led a strenuous
and adventurous life.In the early Indian wars, in the border conflicts in
Texas, and in the advance into Mexico, he had always proved his worth, his
bravery and his knowledge as a soldier.At the outbreak of the Civil War
he had already been brevetted Brigadier-General, and had been commander of
the military district of Utah.An ardent Southerner, he made his choice,
dictated by heart and conscience, and the Federal authorities knew the
loss they would sustain and the gain that would be given to the cause of
the Confederacy.In '61 he was assigned to a district including Kentucky
and Tennessee with the rank of General.At once he displayed his gifts as
an organizer, but Shiloh cut short a career that would have led him to a
high place in fame and history.The early Confederate successes of the 6th
of April were due to his leadership.His manner of death and his way of
meeting it attested to his bravery.Struck by a minie ball, he kept in the
saddle, falling exhausted and dying from the loss of blood.His death put
the whole South into mourning.[Illustration: CAMP OF THE NINTH MISSISSIPPI.Southern soldiers in shirtsleeves a few months before they fought bravely

To no one who was close to him in the stirring scenes of the early
conflict in the West did Grant pay higher tribute than to this veteran of
the Mexican War who was his Chief of Staff.He was a man to be relied upon
in counsel and in emergency, a fact that the coming leader recognized from
the very outset.An artillery officer and engineer, his military training
and practical experience made him a most valuable executive.He had also
the gift of leading men and inspiring confidence.Always cool and
collected in the face of danger, and gifted with a personality that won
friends everywhere, the reports of all of his superiors show the trust and
confidence that were reposed in him.In April, 1861, he had taken charge
of the fortifications at Cairo, Illinois.He was with Grant at Paducah, at
Forts Henry and Donelson, and at Shiloh where he collected the artillery
near the Landing that repelled the final Confederate attack on April 6th.He remained Chief of Staff until October, 1862.On October 14th, he was
made a Brigadier-General of Volunteers, and was appointed superintendent
of military railroads in the Department of Tennessee.Later he was Chief
of Staff to General Sherman, and again proved his worth when he was with
General Thomas at Hood's defeat before Nashville in December, 1864.On
March 13, 1865, he received the brevet of Major-General of Volunteers.[Illustration: WAITING FOR THE SMELL OF POWDER--CONFEDERATES BEFORE SHILOH

PITTSBURG LANDING--A FEW DAYS AFTER THE BATTLE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]By the name of "Pittsburg Landing," this Tennessee River point,
Southerners designate the conflict of April 6 and 7, 1862.The building
upon the left and one farther up the bank were the only ones standing at
the time of the battle.Of the six steamers, the name of the _Tycoon_,
which brought hospital supplies from the Cincinnati branch of the Sanitary
Commission, is visible.Johnston's plan in the attack on the Federal
forces was to pound away on their left until they were driven away from
the Landing and huddled in the angle between the Tennessee River and Snake
Creek.The onset of the Confederates was full of dash.Sherman was at
length driven from Shiloh Church, and the command of Prentiss was
surrounded and forced to surrender.It looked as if Johnston would crush
the left.Just at this point he was struck down by a minie-ball from the
last line of a Federal force that he had victoriously driven back.The
success of the day now begins to tell on the Confederate army.But the men in gray push vigorously toward the
point where these boats lie anchored.Some heavy guns are massed near this
point.Reenforcements are arriving across the river, but General
Beauregard, who succeeds Johnston in command, suspends the battle till the
morrow.During the night 24,000 fresh troops are taken across the river by
the transports here pictured.They successfully withstand the attempt of
Beauregard, and with the arrival of Lew Wallace from up the river victory
shifts to the Stars and Stripes.THE GUNBOATS AT SHILOH

In the river near Pittsburg Landing, where the Federal transports lay,
were two small gunboats, and what they did during the battle of April 6th
makes a separate chapter in the action.In the early morning they were out
of sight, though within sound of the continuous firing.How the battle was
going, however, was evident.The masses of the blue-clad troops appeared
through the trees on the river bank, showing that under the continuous and
fierce assaults they were falling back upon the Landing.The _Tyler_,
commanded by Lieutenant Gwin, and afterward the _Lexington_, commanded by
Lieutenant Shirk, which arrived at four o'clock, strove to keep the
Confederate army from the Landing.After the surrender of Prentiss,
General Withers set his division in motion to the right toward this point.Chalmers' and Jackson's brigades marched into the ravine of Dill's Branch
and into the range of the Federal gunboats and batteries which silenced
Gage's battery, the only one Withers had, and played havoc with the
Confederate skirmishers.All the rest of the afternoon, until nightfall,
the river sailors kept up their continuous bombardment, and in connection
with the field batteries on the bank checked General Withers' desperate
attempt on the Landing.The dauntless brigade of Chalmers, whose brave
Southerners held their ground near the foot of the ravine and maintained
the conflict after the battle was ended elsewhere, was swept by the
gunboats' fire.When Buell's army, that had been hurrying up to Grant's
assistance, reached the battle-field, Gwin sent a messenger ashore in the
evening to General Nelson, who had just arrived, and asked in what manner
he could now be of service.It was pitch dark; except for the occasional
firing of the pickets the armies were resting after the terrific combat.In reply to Gwin's inquiry, General Nelson requested that the gunboats
keep on firing during the night, and that every ten minutes an 8-inch
shell should be launched in the direction of the Confederate camp.With
great precision Gwin followed out this course.Through the forest the
shells shrieked and exploded over the exhausted Confederates, showering
branches and limbs upon them where they slept, and tearing great gashes in
the earth.The result was that they got little rest, and rest was
necessary.Slowly a certain demoralization became evident--results that
bore fruit in the action that opened on the morrow.Here we see
pictured--in the lower part of the page--the captain's gig and crew near
the _Lexington_, ready to row their commander out into the stream.[Illustration: THE _LEXINGTON_]

[Illustration: FOURTEENTH IOWA VETERANS

AT LIBBY PRISON, RICHMOND, IN 1862, ON THEIR WAY TO FREEDOM

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]In the battle of Shiloh the Fourteenth Iowa Infantry formed part of that
self-constituted forlorn hope which made the victory of April 7, 1862,
possible.It held the center at the "Hornet's Nest," fighting the
live-long day against fearful odds.Just as the sun was setting, Colonel
William T. Shaw, seeing that he was surrounded and further resistance
useless, surrendered the regiment.These officers and men were held as
prisoners of war until October 12, 1862, when, moving by Richmond,
Virginia, and Annapolis, Maryland, they went to Benton Barracks, Missouri,
being released on parole, and were declared exchanged on the 19th of
November.This photograph was taken while they were held at Richmond,
opposite the cook-houses of Libby Prison.The third man from the left in
the front row, standing with his hand grasping the lapel of his coat, is
George Marion Smith, a descendant of General Marion of Revolutionary fame.It is through the courtesy of his son, N. H. Smith, that this photograph
appears here.The Fourteenth Iowa Infantry was organized at Davenport and
mustered in November 6, 1861.At Shiloh the men were already veterans of
Forts Henry and Donelson.Those who were not captured fought in the battle
of Corinth, and after the prisoners were exchanged they took part in the
Red River expedition and several minor engagements.They were mustered out
November 16, 1864, when the veterans and recruits were consolidated in two
companies and assigned to duty in Springfield, Illinois, till August,
1865.These two companies were mustered out on August 8th.The regiment
lost during service five officers and fifty-nine enlisted men killed and
mortally wounded, and one officer and 138 enlisted men by disease.Iowa
sent nine regiments of cavalry, four batteries of light artillery and
fifty-one regiments of infantry to the Union armies, a grand total of
76,242 soldiers.[Illustration: THE MOUNTED POLICE OF THE WEST.]Stalwart horsemen such as these bore the brunt of keeping order in the
turbulent regions fought over by the armies in the West.The bugle call,
"Boots and Saddles!"might summon them to fight, or to watch the movements
of the active Confederates, Van Dorn and Price.It was largely due to
their daring and bravery that the Confederate forces were held back from
the Mississippi so as not to embarrass the movements of Grant and the
gunboats.Of this unattached cavalry of the Army of the Ohio were the men
in the upper picture--Company D, Fourth Kentucky Volunteers, enlisted at
Louisville, December, 1861.[Illustration: OFFICERS OF THE FOURTH KENTUCKY CAVALRY.][Illustration: THE FLEET THAT CLEARED THE RIVER

COPYRIGHT, 1911."A spear-thrust in the back" was delivered to the Confederacy by the
inland-river fleet that cut it in two.The squadron of Flag-Officer Davis
is here lying near Memphis.Thus appeared the Federal gunboats on June 5,
1862, two miles above the city.Fort Pillow had been abandoned the
previous day, but the Confederate river-defense flotilla still remained
below and the Federals, still smarting from the disaster inflicted on the
"Cincinnati," were determined to bring on a decisive engagement and, if
possible, clear the river of their antagonists.Meanwhile four new vessels
had joined the Federal squadron.These were river steamers which Charles
Ellet, Jr., had converted into rams in the short space of six weeks.Their
principle was as old as history, but it was now to be tried for the first
time in aid of the Federal cause.On these heights above the river the
inhabitants of Memphis were crowded on the morning of June 6, 1862, as the
Federal squadron moved down-stream against the Confederate gunboats that
were drawn up in double line of battle opposite the city.Everyone wanted
to see the outcome of the great fight that was impending, for if its
result proved adverse to the Confederates, Memphis would fall into Federal
hands and another stretch of the Mississippi would be lost to the South.In the engagement at Memphis two of the Ellet rams accompanied the
squadron--the "Queen of the West" commanded by Charles Ellet, and the
"Monarch" commanded by his younger brother, Major Alfred Ellet.The
Confederate flotilla was destroyed, but with the loss of Charles Ellet,
from a mortal wound.[Illustration: MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE ON THE HEIGHTS]

[Illustration: A LOCOMOTIVE THAT HANGED EIGHT MEN AS SPIES

COPYRIGHT, 1911.In April, 1862, J. J. Andrews, a citizen of Kentucky and a spy in General
Buell's employment, proposed seizing a locomotive on the Western and
Atlantic Railroad at some point below Chattanooga and running it back to
that place, cutting telegraph wires and burning bridges on the way.General O. M. Mitchel authorized the plan and twenty-two men volunteered
to carry it out.On the morning of April 12th, the train they were on
stopped at Big Shanty station for breakfast.The bridge-burners (who were
in citizens' clothes) detached the locomotive and three box-cars and
started at full speed for Chattanooga, but after a run of about a hundred
miles their fuel was exhausted and their pursuers were in sight.Andrews was condemned as a spy and hanged at Atlanta,
July 7th.The others were confined at Chattanooga, Knoxville, and
afterward at Atlanta, where seven were executed as spies.Of the fourteen
survivors, eight escaped from prison; and of these, six eventually reached
the Union lines.Six were removed to Richmond and confined in Castle
Thunder until they were exchanged in 1863.The Confederates attempted to
destroy the locomotive when they evacuated Atlanta.[Illustration: BATTLE BETWEEN THE MONITOR AND MERRIMAC._Painted by E. Packbauer._

[Illustration: THE BIGGEST GUN OF ALL--THE 20-INCH MONSTER FOR WHICH NO
TARGET WOULD SERVE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.A photograph of the only 20-inch gun made during the war.On March 30, 1861, a 15-inch Columbiad was heralded in
_Harper's Weekly_ as the biggest gun in the world, but three years later
this was exceeded.In 1844 Lieutenant (later Brigadier-General) Thomas
Jefferson Rodman of the Ordnance Department commenced a series of tests to
find a way to obviate the injurious strains set up in the metal, by
cooling a large casting from the exterior.He finally developed his theory
of casting a gun with the core hollow and then cooling it by a stream of
water or cold air through it.So successful was this method that the War
Department, in 1860, authorized a 15-inch smooth-bore gun.General Rodman then projected his 20-inch smooth-bore gun,
which was made in 1864 under his direction at Fort Pitt, Pittsburg,
Pennsylvania.It was mounted at Fort Hamilton, New York Harbor, very soon
afterwards, but on account of the tremendous size and destructive effect
of its projectiles it was fired only four times during the war.It was
almost impossible to get a target that would withstand the shots and leave
anything to show what had happened.These four shots were fired with 50,
75, 100 and 125 pounds of powder.The projectile weighed 1,080 pounds, and
the maximum pressure on the bore was 25,000 pounds.In March, 1867, it was
again fired four times with 125, 150, 175 and 200 pounds of powder, each
time with an elevation of twenty-five degrees, the projectile attaining a
maximum range of 8,001 yards.This is no mean record even compared with
twentieth century pieces.NEWS OF MARCH 30, 1861

    Gun at Fort Monroe, Virginia; and also a picture, from a recent

    test it.It is proper that we should say that the small drawing is
    from the lithograph which is published in MAJOR BARNARD'S "Notes on
    Sea-Coast Defense," published by Mr.D. Van Nostrand, of this city.This gun was cast at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, by Knapp, Rudd, &, Co.,

[Illustration: THE "CHEESE BOX" THAT MADE HISTORY AS IT APPEARED FOUR
MONTHS LATER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.In this remarkable view of the "Monitor's" turret, taken in July, 1862, is
seen as clearly as on the day after the great battle the effect of the
Confederate fire upon Ericsson's novel craft.As the two vessels
approached each other about half-past eight on that immortal Sunday
morning, the men within the turret waited anxiously for the first shot of
their antagonist.It soon came from her bow gun and went wide of the mark.The "Virginia" no longer had the broadside of a wooden ship at which to
aim.Not until the "Monitor" was alongside the big ironclad at close range
came the order "Begin firing" to the men in the "cheese box."Then the
gun-ports of the turret were triced back, and it began to revolve for the
first time in battle.As soon as the guns were brought to bear, two
11-inch solid shot struck the "Virginia's" armor; almost immediately she
replied with her broadside, and Lieutenant Greene and his gunners listened
anxiously to the shells bursting against their citadel.They made no more
impression than is apparent in the picture.Confident in the protection of
their armor, the Federals reloaded with a will and came again and again to
close quarters with their adversary, hurling two great projectiles about
every eight minutes.[Illustration: MEN ON THE "MONITOR" WHO FOUGHT WITH WORDEN

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Here on the deck of the "Monitor" sit some of the men who held up the
hands of Lieutenant Worden in the great fight with the "Virginia."In the
picture, taken in July, 1862, only four months afterward, one of the nine
famous dents on the turret are visible.It required courage not only to
fight in the "Monitor" for the first time but to embark on her at all, for
she was a strange and untried invention at which many high authorities
shook their heads.But during the battle, amid all the difficulties of
breakdowns by the new untried machinery, Lieutenant S. Dana Greene coolly
directed his men, who kept up a fire of remarkable accuracy.Twenty of the
forty-one 11-inch shot fired from the "Monitor" took effect, more or less,
on the iron plates of the "Virginia."The "Monitor" was struck nine times
on her turret, twice on the pilot-house, thrice on the deck, and eight
times on the side.While Greene was fighting nobly in the turret, Worden
with the helmsman in the pilot-house was bravely maneuvering his vessel
and seeking to ram his huge antagonist.Twice he almost succeeded and both
times Greene's guns were used on the "Virginia" at point-blank range with
telling effect.Toward the close of the action Worden was blinded by a
shell striking near one of the peep-holes in the pilot-house and the
command devolved upon Greene.Worden, even in his agony of pain while the
doctor was attending his injuries, asked constantly about the progress of
the battle; and when told that the "Minnesota" was safe, he said, "Then I
can die happy."[Illustration: ADMIRAL J. L. WORDEN]


DAVID GLASGOW FARRAGUT THE MAN WHO DARED AT NEW ORLEANS AND MOBILE BAY

[Illustration]

"ANY MAN WHO IS PREPARED FOR DEFEAT WOULD BE HALF DEFEATED BEFORE HE
COMMENCED"

THE COMMANDER OF THE FEDERAL FLEET AT NEW ORLEANS

"Who is this Farragut?"So the younger generation of Americans must have
wondered, at the news of late January, 1862.Farragut was to have a flag
in the Gulf and was expected to capture New Orleans.Thus far in the War,
he had done nothing but sit on an obscure retiring board in the Navy
Department at Washington.But Commander David D. Porter knew him, for it
was with Porter's own father in the famous old "Essex" that Farragut as a
mere boy had proved worthy to command a fighting ship.And now it was
Porter who had recommended him for a task considered gravely dangerous by
all, foolhardy by not a few.This was no less than to pass the forts below
New Orleans, defeat a powerful and determined Confederate flotilla,
capture the city, and then sweep up the Mississippi and split the
Confederacy in two.To this Farragut rigidly held himself and the brave
men under him, when, in the dark hour before dawn of April 24, 1862, they
faced the terrible bombardment of the forts and fought their way through
the flames of fire rafts desperately maneuvered by the opposing gunboats.Next day New Orleans was Farragut's.Leaving it to the co-operating army
under General B. F. Butler, Farragut pushed on up the river, passed and
repassed the fortifications at Vicksburg, but the army needed to drive
home the wedge thus firmly entered by the navy was not yet ready.It was
another year before the sturdy blows of Farragut were effectually
supplemented ashore.[Illustration: THE MEN WHO DARED--SAILORS ON THE "HARTFORD" AFTER PASSING
THE NEW ORLEANS FORTS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]On this page of unwritten history McPherson and Oliver, the New Orleans
war-time photographers, have caught the crew of the staunch old "Hartford"
as they relaxed after their fiery test.In unconscious picturesqueness
grouped about the spar-deck, the men are gossiping or telling over again
their versions of the great deeds done aboard the flagship.Some have
seized the opportunity for a little plain sewing, while all are interested
in the new and unfamiliar process of "having their pictures taken."The
notable thing about the picture is the number of young faces.Only a few
of the old salts whose bearded and weather-beaten faces give evidence of
service in the old navy still remain.After the great triumph in Mobile
Bay, Farragut said of these men: "I have never seen a crew come up like
ours.They are ahead of the old set in small arms, and fully equal to them
at the great guns.They arrived here a mere lot of boys and young men, and
have now fattened up and knocked the nine-inch guns about like twenty-four
pounders, to the astonishment of everybody.There was but one man who
showed fear and he was allowed to resign.This was the most desperate
battle I ever fought since the days of the old 'Essex.'""It was the
anxious night of my life," wrote Farragut later.The spar-deck shown below
recalls another speech."Don't flinch from that fire, boys!There is a
hotter fire for those who don't do their duty!"So shouted Farragut with
his ship fast aground and a huge fire-raft held hard against her wooden
side by the little Confederate tug "Mosher."The ship seemed all ablaze
and the men, "breathing fire," were driven from their guns.Farragut,
calmly pacing the poop deck, called out his orders, caring nothing for the
rain of shot from Fort St.The men, inspired by such coolness,
leaped to their stations again and soon a shot pierced the boiler of the
plucky "Mosher" and sank her.[Illustration: SPAR-DECK OF THE "HARTFORD"]




THE FIGHT FOR RICHMOND


A shattered and discomfited army were the hosts of McDowell when they
reached the banks of the Potomac, after that ill-fated July Sunday at Bull
Run.Dispirited by the sting of defeat, this motley and unorganized mass
of men became rather a mob than an army.The transformation of this chaos
of demoralization into the trained, disciplined, and splendid troops of
the Grand Army of the Potomac, was a triumph of the "young Napoleon"--Gen.Fresh from his victories in the mountains of
West Virginia, he was called to Washington to transmute 200,000 American
citizens, fresh from shop and farm, into soldiers.For months it was "drill, drill."Public opinion grew restless at the cry
"All's Quiet Along the Potomac."At last, on March 17th, McClellan moved.On April 5th the Union army was advancing toward Richmond up the
Peninsula, but was stopped at Yorktown by the Confederate General
Magruder.Not until May 3rd were McClellan's siege guns in place.At Williamsburg the lines in Gray
stood again."Jeb" Stuart, D. H. Hill, and Jubal Early fought nobly.They
gained their object--more time for their retreating comrades.But
McClellan's fighting leaders, Hooker, Kearny and Hancock, were not to be
denied.With Yorktown and Williamsburg inscribed upon its victorious banners, the
Army of the Potomac took up again its toilsome march from Cumberland
Landing toward the Confederate capital on the James.It was the 16th of May, 1862, when the advanced corps reached White House,
the ancestral home of the Lees.On every side were fields of wheat, and,
were it not for the presence of one hundred thousand men, there was the
promise of a full harvest.It was here that General McClellan took up his
headquarters, a distance of twenty-four miles from Richmond.In the Confederate capital a panic had seized the people.As the
retreating army of Johnston sought the environs of Richmond and news of
the invading hosts was brought in, fear took possession of the inhabitants
and many wild rumors were afloat as to the probable capture of the city.But it was not a fear that Johnston would not fight.The strategic policy
of the Southern general had been to delay the advance of the Northern
army.Fortunately for him, the rainy weather proved a powerful ally.The
time had now come when he should change his position from the defensive to
the offensive.The Army of Northern Virginia had been brought to bay, and
it now turned to beat off the invaders and save its capital.On the historic Peninsula lay two of the greatest and most splendid armies
that had ever confronted each other on the field of battle.The
engagement, now imminent, was to be the first in that series of contests,
between the Army of the Potomac and the Army of Northern Virginia, ending
three years thereafter, at Appomattox, when the war-worn veterans of gray
should lay down their arms, in honor, to the war-worn veterans of blue.The Union advance was retarded by the condition of the weather and the
roads.Between McClellan's position at White House and the waiting
Confederate army lay the Chickahominy, an erratic and sluggish stream,
that spreads itself out in wooded swamps and flows around many islands,
forming a valley from half a mile to a mile wide, bordered by low bluffs.In dry weather it is but a mere brook, but a moderate shower will cause it
to rise quickly and to offer formidable opposition to any army seeking its
passage.The valley is covered with trees whose tops reach to the level
of the adjacent highlands, thus forming a screen from either side.The
bridges crossing it had all been destroyed by the retreating army except
the one at Mechanicsville, and it was not an easy task that awaited the
forces of McClellan as they made their way across the spongy soil.The van of the Union army reached the Chickahominy on May 20th.The bridge
was gone but the men under General Naglee forded the little river,
reaching the plateau beyond, and made a bold reconnaissance before the
Confederate lines.In the meantime, newly constructed bridges were
beginning to span the Chickahominy, and the Federal army soon was crossing
to the south bank of the river.General McClellan had been promised reenforcements from the north.General
McDowell with forty thousand men had started from Fredericksburg to join
him north of the Chickahominy.For this reason, General McClellan had
thrown the right wing of his army on the north of the river while his left
would rest on the south side of the stream.This position of his army did
not escape the eagle eye of the Confederate general, Joseph E. Johnston,
who believed the time had now come to give battle, and perhaps destroy the
small portion of the Union forces south of the river.Meanwhile, General "Stonewall" Jackson, in the Shenandoah, was making
threatening movements in the direction of Washington, and McDowell's
orders to unite with McClellan were recalled.The roads in and about Richmond radiate from that city like the spokes of
a wheel.One of these is the Williamsburg stage-road, crossing the
Chickahominy at Bottom's Bridge, only eleven miles from Richmond.It was
along this road that the Federal corps of Keyes and Heintzelman had made
their way.Their orders were "to go prepared for battle at a moment's
notice" and "to bear in mind that the Army of the Potomac has never been
checked."Parallel to this road, and about a mile to the northward, runs the
Richmond and York River Railroad.Seven miles from Richmond another
highway intersects the one from Williamsburg, known as the Nine Mile road.At the point of this intersection once grew a clump of seven pines, hence
the name of "Seven Pines," often given to the battle fought on this spot.A thousand yards beyond the pines were two farmhouses in a grove of oaks.Where the Nine Mile road crossed the railroad was
Fair Oaks Station.Southeast of Seven Pines was White Oak Swamp.Casey's division of Keyes'
corps was stationed at Fair Oaks Farm.A fifth of a mile in front lay his
picket line, extending crescent shape, from the swamp to the Chickahominy.Couch's division of the same corps was at Seven Pines, with his right wing
extending along the Nine Mile road to Fair Oaks Station.Heintzelman's
corps lay to the rear; Kearney's division guarded the railroad at Savage's
Station and Hooker's the approaches to the White Oak Swamp.It was a well-wooded region and at this time was
in many places no more than a bog.No sooner had these positions been
taken, than trees were cut to form abatis, rifle-pits were hastily dug,
and redoubts for placing artillery were constructed.The picket line lay
along a dense growth of woods.Through an opening in the trees, the
Confederate army could be seen in force on the other side of the clearing.The plans of the Confederate general were well matured.On Friday, May
30th, he gave orders that his army should be ready to move at daybreak.That night the "windows of heaven seemed to have been opened" and the
"fountains of the deep broken up."It was
the most violent storm that had swept over that region for a generation.The thunderbolts rolled without
cessation.The earth was
thoroughly drenched.From mud-soaked beds
the soldiers arose the next morning to battle.Owing to the storm the Confederates did not move so early as intended.However, some of the troops were in readiness by eight o'clock.Hour after
hour the forces of Longstreet and Hill awaited the sound of the signal-gun
that would tell them General Huger was in his position to march.It was near noon before General Hill, weary of waiting,
advanced to the front, preceded by a line of skirmishers, along the
Williamsburg road.The Union pickets were lying at the edge of the forest.The soldiers in the pits had been under arms for several hours awaiting
the attack.Suddenly there burst through the woods the soldiers of the
South.A shower of bullets fell beneath the trees and the Union pickets
gave way.On and on came the lines of gray in close columns.In front of
the abatis had been planted a battery of four guns.General Naglee with
four regiments, the Fifty-sixth and One hundredth New York and Eleventh
Maine and One hundred and fourth Pennsylvania, had gone forward, and in
the open field met the attacking army.Naglee's men charged with their bayonets and pressed the gray lines back
again to the edge of the woods.Here they were met by a furious fire of
musketry and quickly gave way, seeking the cover of the rifle-pits at Fair
Oaks Farm.In this position, for nearly three
hours the Federals waged an unequal combat against three times their
number.Then, suddenly a galling fire plowed in on them from the left.It
came from Rains' brigade, which had executed a flank movement.At the same
time the brigade of Rodes rushed toward them.The Federals saw the
hopelessness of the situation.The officers at the batteries tried to
spike their guns but were killed in the attempt.Hastily falling back,
five guns were left to be turned on them in their retreat.In another minute they would have been entirely surrounded
and captured.The next stand would be made at
Seven Pines, where Couch was stationed.The forces here had been weakened
by sending relief to Casey.The situation of the Federals was growing
critical.At the same time General Longstreet sent reenforcements to
General Hill.Couch was forced out of his position toward the right in the
direction of Fair Oaks Station and was thus separated from the main body
of the army, then in action.The Confederates pushed strongly against the Federal center.Heintzelman
came to the rescue.For an hour and a
half the lines of blue and gray surged back and forth.The Federals were
gradually giving way.The left wing, alone, next to the White Oak Swamp,
was holding its own.At the same time over at Fair Oaks Station whither Couch had been forced,
were new developments.He was about to strike the Confederate army on its
left flank, but just when the guns were being trained, there burst across
the road the troops of General G. W. Smith, who up to this time had been
inactive.These men were fresh for the fight, superior in number, and soon
overpowered the Northerners.It looked for a time as if the whole Union
army south of the Chickahominy was doomed.Over at Seven Pines the center of McClellan's army was about to be routed.Now it was that General Heintzelman personally collected about eighteen
hundred men, the fragments of the broken regiments, and took a decided
stand at the edge of the timber.But
this alone would not nor did not save the day.To the right of this new
line of battle, there was a rise of ground.From here the woods abruptly
sloped to the rear.If this elevation were once secured by the
Confederates, all would be lost and rout would be inevitable.The quick
eye of General Keyes took in the situation.He was stationed on the left;
to reach the hill would necessitate taking his men between the
battle-lines.Calling on a
single regiment to follow he made a dash for the position.The Southern
troops, divining his intention, poured a deadly volley into his ranks and
likewise attempted to reach this key to the situation.The Federals gained
the spot just in time.The new line was formed as a heavy mass of
Confederates came upon them.The tremendous Union fire was too much for
the assaulting columns, which were checked.They had forced the Federal
troops back from their entrenchments a distance of two miles, but they
never got farther than these woods.The river fog now came up as the
evening fell and the Southern troops spent the night in the captured
camps, sleeping on their arms.The Federals fell back toward the river to
an entrenched camp.Meanwhile at Fair Oaks Station the day was saved, too, in the nick of
time, for the Federals.On the north side of the Chickahominy were
stationed the two divisions of Sedgwick and Richardson, under command of
General Sumner.Scarcely had the battle opened when McClellan at his
headquarters, six miles away, heard the roar and rattle of artillery.He
was sick at the time, but he ordered General Sumner to be in readiness.At
this time there were four bridges across the river--two of them were
Bottom's Bridge and the railroad bridge.To go by either of these would
consume too much time in case of an emergency.General Sumner had himself
constructed two more bridges, lying between the others.The heavy flood of
the preceding night, which was still rising, had swept one of these
partially away.In order to save time, he put his men under arms and
marched them to the end of the upper bridge and there waited throughout
the greater part of the afternoon for orders to cross.Before them rolled
a muddy and swollen stream, above whose flood was built a rude and
unstable structure.From the other side could be distinctly heard the
roar of battle.The fate of the day and of the Army of the Potomac rested
upon these men at the end of the bridge.The possibility of crossing was doubted by everyone, including the general
himself.The bridge had been built of logs, held together and kept from
drifting by the stumps of trees.Over the river proper it was suspended by
ropes attached to trees, felled across the stream.At last the long-expected order to advance came.The men stepped upon the
floating bridge.It swayed to and fro as the solid column passed over it.Beneath the men was the angry flood which would engulf all if the bridge
should fall.Gradually the weight pressed it down between the solid stumps
and it was made secure till the army had crossed.Had the passage been
delayed another hour the flood would have rendered it impassable.Guided by the roar of battle the troops hurried on.The artillery was left
behind in the mud of the Chickahominy.The steady, rolling fire of
musketry and the boom of cannon told of deadly work in front.It was
nearly six o'clock before Sedgwick's column deployed into line in the rear
of Fair Oaks Station.Just now there was a lull in
the battle.The Confederates were gathering themselves for a vigorous
assault on their opponents' flaming front.General Joseph E. Johnston himself had immediate command.President
Jefferson Davis had come out from his capital to witness the contest.A heavy fusillade poured from
their batteries and muskets.Great rents were made in the line of blue.The openings were quickly filled and a scorching fire was
sent into the approaching columns.Again and again the charge was repeated
only to be repulsed.Then came the order to fix bayonets.Five
regiments--Thirty-fourth and Eighty-second New York, Fifteenth and
Twentieth Massachusetts and Seventh Michigan--pushed to the front.Into
the woods where the Confederates had fallen back the charge was made.Driving the Southern lines back in confusion, these dashing columns saved
the day for the Army of the Potomac.Night was now settling over the wooded field.Here and there flashes of
light could be seen among the oaks, indicating a diligent search for the
wounded.General Johnston ordered his troops to sleep on the field.A few
minutes later he was struck by a rifle-ball and almost immediately a shell
hit him, throwing him from his horse, and he was borne off the field.The
first day of the battle was over.The disability of the Southern commander made it possible for the
promotion of a new leader upon whom the fortunes of the Army of Northern
Virginia would soon rest.This was General Robert E. Lee; although the
immediate command for the next day's contest fell upon General G. W.
Smith.Early Sunday morning the battle was again in progress.The command
of Smith, near Fair Oaks Station, advanced down the railroad, attacking
Richardson, whose lines were north of it and were using the embankment as
a fortification.Longstreet's men were south of the railroad.The firing
was heavy all along this line, the opposing forces being not more than
fifty yards from each other.For an hour and a half the musketry fire was
intensely heavy.The line of gray could
not withstand the galling fire and for the first time that day fell back.But the Union line had been broken, too.Both sides
were gathering themselves for another onslaught.It was then that there
were heard loud shouts from the east of the railroad.There, coming through the woods, was a large body of Federal troops.They formed a magnificent body of soldiers and
seemed eager for the fray.Turning in on the Williamsburg road they
rapidly deployed to the right and the left.In front of them was an open
field, with a thick wood on the other side.The Confederates had posted
themselves in this forest and were waiting for their antagonists.The
Federals marched upon the field in double-quick time; their movements
became a run, and they began firing as they dashed forward.They were met
by a withering fire of field artillery and a wide gap being opened in
their ranks.They reached the edge of the woods and
as they entered its leafy shadows the tide of battle rolled in with them.The front line was lost to view in the forest, except for an occasional
gleam of arms from among the trees.The din and the clash and roar of
battle were heard for miles.It was almost
a hand-to-hand combat in the heavy forest and tangled slashings.The sound
of battle gradually subsided, then ceased except for the intermittent
reports of small arms, and the second day's fight was over.The Federal troops could
now occupy without molestation the positions they held the previous
morning.The forest paths were strewn with the dead and the dying.Many of
the wounded were compelled to lie under the scorching sun for hours before
help reached them.Every farmhouse became an improvised hospital where the
suffering soldiers lay.Many were placed upon cars and taken across the
Chickahominy.The dead soldiers, blue and
gray, found sometimes lying within a few feet of each other, were buried
on the field of battle.The two giants had met in their first great combat
and were even now beginning to gird up their loins for a desperate
struggle before the capital of the Confederacy.[Illustration: "LITTLE MAC" PREPARING FOR THE CAMPAIGN--A ROYAL AIDE

COPYRIGHT, 1911 REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]A picture taken in the fall of 1861, when McClellan was at the
headquarters of General George W. Morell (who stands at the extreme left),
commanding a brigade in Fitz John Porter's Division.Morell was then

General McClellan was engaged in transforming the raw recruits in the
camps near the national capital into the finished soldiers of the Army of
the Potomac."Little Mac," as they called him, was at this time at the
height of his popularity.He appears in the center between two of his

RAMPARTS THAT BAFFLED McCLELLAN.(Hasty fortifications of the Confederates
at Yorktown.)It was against such fortifications as these, which Magruder
had hastily reenforced with sand-bags, that McClellan spent a month
preparing his heavy batteries.Magruder had far too few soldiers to man
his long line of defenses properly, and his position could have been taken
by a single determined attack.This rampart was occupied by the
Confederate general, D. H. Hill, who had been the first to enter Yorktown
in order to prepare it for siege.He was the last to leave it on the night
of May 3, 1862.[Illustration]

WRECKED ORDNANCE.(Gun exploded by the Confederates on General Hill's
rampart, Yorktown.)Although the Confederates abandoned 200 pieces of
ordnance at Yorktown, they were able to render most of them useless before
leaving.Hill succeeded in terrorizing the Federals with grape-shot, and
some of this was left behind.After the evacuation the ramparts were
overrun by Union trophy seekers.The soldier resting his hands upon his
musket is one of the Zouaves whose bright and novel uniforms were so
conspicuous early in the war.This spot was directly on the line of the
British fortification of 1781.[Illustration]

ordnance fell into the hands of the Confederates early in the war, through
the ill-advised and hasty abandonment of Norfolk Navy Yard by the
Federals.Many of these guns did service at Yorktown and subsequently on
the James River against the Union.[Illustration: COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.THE CONFEDERATE COMMAND OF THE RIVER.Looking north up the river, four of the five 8-inch Columbiads composing

Confederates, the guns being spiked.The vessels in the river are
transport ships, with the exception of the frigate just off shore.[Illustration: THE GOAL--THE CONFEDERATE CAPITOL]

TWO KEEPERS OF THE GOAL

The North expected General McClellan to possess himself of this citadel of
the Confederacy in June, 1862, and it seemed likely the expectation would
be realized.In the upper picture we get a near view of the State House at
Richmond, part of which was occupied as a Capitol by the Confederate
Congress during the war.In this building were stored the records and
archives of the Confederate Government, many of which were lost during the
hasty retreat of President Davis and his cabinet at the evacuation of
Richmond, April, 1865.Below, we see the city of Richmond from afar, with
the Capitol standing out boldly on the hill.McClellan was not destined to
reach this coveted goal, and it would not have meant the fall of the
Confederacy had he then done so.When Lincoln entered the building in
1865, the Confederacy had been beaten as much by the blockade as by the
operations of Grant and Sherman with vastly superior forces.[Illustration: THE SPIRES OF RICHMOND

Hill did most of the fierce fighting which drove back the Federals on the
first day, and only the timely arrival of Sumner's troops enabled the
Federals to hold their ground.Had they failed they would have been driven
into the morasses of the Chickahominy, retreat across which would have
been difficult as the bridges were partly submerged by the swollen stream.After General Johnston was wounded, General G. W. Smith was in command
during the second day's fighting.[Illustration: GENERAL G. W. SMITH, C. S.[Illustration: GENERAL D. H. HILL, C. S.[Illustration: THE ADVANCE THAT BECAME A RETREAT]

Here, almost within sight of the goal (Richmond), we see McClellan's
soldiers preparing the way for the passage of the army and its supplies.The soil along the Chickahominy was so marshy that in order to move the
supply trains and artillery from the base at White House and across the
river to the army, corduroy approaches to the bridges had to be built.It
was well that the men got this early practice in road-building.Thanks to
the work kept up, McClellan was able to unite the divided wings of the
army almost at will.[Illustration: "REGULARS" NEAR FAIR OAKS--OFFICERS OF McCLELLAN'S HORSE

Confederate batteries will open upon him, and for the next few moments
shells and bullets from the shrapnels will be bursting and whistling about
his ears.Then he will pass out of the danger-zone to an altitude beyond
the reach of the Confederate artillery.After the evacuation of Yorktown,
May 4, 1862, Professor Lowe, who had been making daily observations from
his balloon, followed McClellan's divisions, which was to meet Longstreet
next day at Williamsburg.On reaching the fortifications of the abandoned
city, Lowe directed the men who were towing the still inflated balloon in
which he was riding to scale the corner of the fort nearest to his old
camp, where the last gun had been fired the night before.This fort had
devoted a great deal of effort to attempting to damage the too inquisitive
balloon, and a short time previously one of the best Confederate guns had
burst, owing to over-charging and too great an elevation to reach the high
altitude.The balloonist had witnessed the explosion and a number of
gunners had been killed and wounded within his sight.His present visit
was in order to touch and examine the pieces and bid farewell to what he
then looked upon as a departed friend.This is indicated as the same gun
on page 371.[Illustration: THE PHOTOGRAPH THE BALLOONIST RECOGNIZED FORTY-EIGHT YEARS

already in the balloon, preparatory to completing the inflation from gas

vital point of the battle."A close examination of this photograph will
reveal Professor Lowe's hand resting on the network of the balloon,
although his body is not in the photograph.It truly is remarkable that
Professor Lowe should have seen and recognized, nearly half a century
afterward, this photograph taken at one of the most critical moments of
his life.[Illustration: THE SLAUGHTER FIELD AT FAIR OAKS.]Over this ground the fiercest fighting of the two days' battle took place,
on May 31, 1862.Some 400 soldiers were buried here, where they fell, and
their hastily dug graves appear plainly in the picture.In the redoubt
seen just beyond the two houses was the center of the Federal line of
battle, equi-distant, about a mile and a half, from both Seven Pines and
Fair Oaks.The entrenchments near these farm dwellings were begun on May
28th by Casey's Division, 4th Corps.There was not time to finish them
before the Confederate attack opened the battle, and the artillery of
Casey's Division was hurriedly placed in position behind the incomplete
works.[Illustration: THE UNFINISHED REDOUBT.]In the smaller picture we see the inside of the redoubt at the left
background of the picture above.The scene is just before the battle and
picks and shovels were still busy throwing up the embankments to
strengthen this center of the Federal defense.Casey's artillery was being
hurriedly brought up.In the background General Sickles' Brigade appears
drawn up in line of battle.When the Confederates first advanced Casey's
artillery did telling work, handsomely repelling the attack early in the
afternoon of May 31st.Later in the day Confederate sharpshooters from
vantage points in neighboring trees began to pick off the officers and the
gunners and the redoubt had to be relinquished.The abandoned guns were
turned against the retreating Federals.[Illustration: THE "REDHOT BATTERY."COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.On the afternoon of May 31st, at Fair Oaks, the Confederates were driving

their own for the rest of the day.The guns grew so hot from constant
firing that it was only with the greatest care that they could be swabbed
and loaded.These earthworks were thrown up for McCarthy's Battery,
Company C, 1st Pennsylvania Artillery, near Savage's Station.The soldiers
nicknamed it the "Redhot Battery."[Illustration: AIMING THE GUNS AT FAIR OAKS.COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.Here we see the beginning of the lull in the fighting of the second day at
Fair Oaks, which it has been asserted led to a fatal delay and the ruin of
McClellan's Peninsula Campaign.The first day's battle at Fair Oaks, May
31, 1862, was decidedly a Federal reverse which would have developed into
a rout had not Sumner, crossing his troops on the perilous Grapevine
Bridge, come up in time to rally the retreating men.Here we see some of
them within the entrenchments at Fair Oaks Station on the Richmond & York
River Railroad.The order will soon come to cease firing at the end of the
second day's fighting, the result of which was to drive the Confederates
back to Richmond.The heavy rainstorm on the
night of May 30th had made the movement of artillery extremely difficult,
and McClellan wanted to complete the bridges and build entrenchments
before advancing.This delay gave the Confederates time to reorganize
their forces and place them under the new commander, Robert E. Lee, who
while McClellan lay inactive effected a junction with "Stonewall" Jackson.Then during the Seven Days' Battles Lee steadily drove McClellan from his
position, within four or five miles of Richmond, to a new position on the
James River.From this secure and advantageous water base McClellan
planned a new line of advance upon the Confederate Capital.In the smaller
picture we see the interior of the works at Fair Oaks Station, which were
named Fort Sumner in honor of the General who brought up his Second Corps
and saved the day.The camp of the Second Corps is seen beyond the

THE CANNONEERS WHO KEPT UP WITH THE CAVALRY--IN THIS SWIFTEST BRANCH OF
THE SERVICE EACH MAN RIDES HORSEBACK

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Here are drawn up Harry Benson's Battery A, of the Second United States
Artillery, and Horatio Gates Gibson's Batteries C and G, combined of the
Third United States Artillery, near Fair Oaks, Virginia.They arrived
there just too late to take part in the battle of June, 1862.By "horse
artillery," or "flying artillery" as it is sometimes called, is meant an
organization equipped usually with 10-pounder rifled guns, with all hands
mounted.In ordinary light artillery the cannoneers either ride on the
gun-carriage or go afoot.In "flying artillery" each cannoneer has a
horse.This form is by far the most mobile of all, and is best suited to
accompany cavalry on account of its ability to travel rapidly.With the
exception of the method of mounting the cannoneers, there was not any
difference between the classes of field batteries except as they were
divided between "light" and "heavy."In the photograph above no one is
riding on the gun-carriages, but all have separate mounts.Battery A of
the Second United States Artillery was in Washington in January, 1861, and
took part in the expedition for the relief of Fort Pickens, Florida.It
went to the Peninsula, fought at Mechanicsville May 23-24, 1862, and took
part in the Seven Days' battles before Richmond June 25th to July 1st.Batteries C and G of the Third United States Artillery were at San
Francisco, California, till October 1861, when they came East, and also
went to the Peninsula and served at Yorktown and in the Seven Days.THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY

    Always mystify, mislead, and surprise the enemy, if possible, and when
    you strike and overcome him, never let up in the pursuit so long as
    your men have strength to follow.... The other rule is, never fight
    against heavy odds, if by any possible maneuvering you can hurl your
    own force on only a part, and that the weakest part, of your enemy and
    crush it.Such tactics will win every time, and a small army may thus
    destroy a large one in detail.--_"Stonewall" Jackson._


The main move of the Union army, for 1862, was to be McClellan's advance
up the Peninsula toward Richmond.Everything had been most carefully
planned by the brilliant strategist.With the assistance of McDowell's
corps, he expected in all confidence to be in the Confederate capital
before the spring had closed.But, comprehensively as he had worked the
scheme out, he had neglected a factor in the problem which was destined in
the end to bring the whole campaign to naught.This was the presence of
"Stonewall" Jackson in the Valley of Virginia.The strategic value to the Confederacy of this broad, sheltered avenue
into Maryland and Pennsylvania was great.Along the northeasterly roads
the gray legions could march in perfect safety upon the rear of Washington
so long as the eastern gaps could be held.No wonder that the Federal
authorities, however much concerned with other problems of the war, never
removed a vigilant eye from the Valley.Jackson had taken possession of Winchester, near the foot of the Valley,
in November, 1861.The Confederate
army dwindled greatly during the winter.At the beginning of March there
were but forty-five hundred men.With Banks and his forty thousand now on
Virginia soil at the foot of the Valley, and Fremont's army approaching
the head, why should the Federal commander even think about this
insignificant fragment of his foe?But the records of war have shown that
a small force, guided by a master mind, sometimes accomplishes more in
effective results than ten times the number under a less active and able
commander.The presence of Banks compelled Jackson to withdraw to Woodstock, fifty
miles south of Winchester.If McClellan ever experienced any anxiety as to
affairs in the Valley, it seems to have left him now, for he ordered Banks
to Manassas on March 16th to cover Washington, leaving General Shields and
his division of seven thousand men to hold the Valley.When Jackson heard
of the withdrawal, he resolved that, cut off as he was from taking part in
the defense of Richmond, he would do what he could to prevent any
aggrandizement of McClellan's forces.Shields hastened to his station at Winchester, and Jackson, on the 23d of
March, massed his troops at Kernstown, about three miles south of the
former place.Deceived as to the strength of his adversary, he led his
weary men to an attack on Shields' right flank about three o'clock in the
afternoon.He carried the ridge where the Federals were posted, but the
energy of his troops was spent, and they had to give way to the reserves
of the Union army after three hours of stubborn contest.The Federal ranks
were diminished by six hundred; the Confederate force by more than seven
hundred.Kernstown was a Union victory; yet never in history did victory
bring such ultimate disaster upon the victors.At Washington the alarm was intense over Jackson's audacious attack.Williams' division of Banks' troops was halted on its way to Manassas and
sent back to Winchester.Lincoln transferred Blenker's division, nine
thousand strong, to Fremont.These things were done at once, but they were
by no means the most momentous consequence of Kernstown.The President
began to fear that Jackson's goal was Washington.After consulting six of
his generals he became convinced that McClellan had not arranged proper
protection for the city.Therefore, McDowell and his corps of thirty-seven
thousand men were ordered to remain at Manassas.The Valley grew to
greater importance in the Federal eyes.Banks was made entirely
independent of McClellan and the defense of this region became his sole
task.McClellan, to his great chagrin, saw his force depleted by forty-six
thousand men.There were now four Union generals in the East operating
independently one of the other.General Ewell with eight thousand troops on the upper Rappahannock and
General Johnson with two brigades were now ordered to cooperate with
Jackson.Schenck and Milroy, of
Fremont's corps, began to threaten Johnson.Banks, with twenty thousand,
was near Harrisonburg.The Confederate leader left General Ewell to watch Banks while he made a
dash for Milroy and Schenck.He fought them at McDowell on May 8th and
they fled precipitately to rejoin Fremont.The swift-acting Jackson now
darted at Banks, who had fortified himself at Strasburg.Jackson stopped
long enough to be joined by Ewell.He did not attack Strasburg, but stole
across the Massanutten Mountain unknown to Banks, and made for Front
Royal, where a strong Union detachment was stationed under Colonel Kenly.Early on the afternoon of May 23d, Ewell rushed from the forest.Kenly and
his men fled before them toward Winchester.A large number were captured
by the cavalry before they had gotten more than four miles away.Banks at Strasburg realized that Jackson was approaching from the rear,
the thing he had least expected and had made no provision for.There was nothing to be done but
retreat to Winchester.Even that was prevented by the remarkable speed of
Jackson's men, who could march as much as thirty-five miles a day.On May
24th, the Confederates overtook and struck the receding Union flank near
Newtown, inflicting heavy loss and taking many prisoners.Altogether,
three thousand of Banks' men fell into Jackson's hands.This exploit was most opportune for the Southern arms.It caused the final
ruin of McClellan's hopes.Banks received one more attack from Ewell's
division the next day as he passed through Winchester on his way to the
shelter of the Potomac.He crossed at Williamsport late the same evening
and wrote the President that his losses, though serious enough, might have
been far worse "considering the very great disparity of forces engaged,
and the long-matured plans of the enemy, which aimed at nothing less than
entire capture of our force."Lincoln now rescinded his resolution to
send McDowell to McClellan.Instead, he transferred twenty thousand of the
former's men to Fremont and informed McClellan that he was not, after all,
to have the aid of McDowell's forty thousand men.Fremont was coming from the west; Shields lay in the other direction, but
Jackson was not the man to be trapped.He managed to hold Fremont while he
marched his main force quickly up the Valley.At Port Republic he drove
Carroll's brigade of Shields' division away and took possession of a
bridge which Colonel Carroll had neglected to burn.Fremont in pursuit was
defeated by Ewell at Cross Keys.Jackson immediately put his force of
twelve thousand over the Shenandoah at Port Republic and burned the
bridge.Safe from the immediate attack by Fremont, he fell upon Tyler and
Carroll, who had not more than three thousand men between them.The
Federals made a brave stand, but after many hours' fighting were compelled
to retreat.Jackson emerged through Swift Run Gap on the 17th of June, to
assist in turning the Union right on the Peninsula, and Banks and Shields,
baffled and checkmated at every move, finally withdrew from the Valley.[Illustration: "STONEWALL" JACKSON AT WINCHESTER 1862

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]It is the great good fortune of American hero-lovers that they can gaze
here upon the features of Thomas Jonathan Jackson precisely as that
brilliant Lieutenant-General of the Confederate States Army appeared
during his masterly "Valley Campaign" of 1862.Few photographers dared to
approach this man, whose silence and modesty were as deep as his mastery
of warfare.Indeed, his plans were rarely
known even to his immediate subordinates, and herein lay the secret of
those swift and deadly surprises that raised him to first rank among the
world's military figures.Jackson's ability and efficiency won the utter
confidence of his ragged troops; and their marvelous forced marches, their
contempt for privations if under his guidance, put into his hands a living
weapon such as no other leader in the mighty conflict had ever wielded.[Illustration: NANCY HART THE CONFEDERATE GUIDE AND SPY

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The women of the mountain districts of Virginia were as ready to do scout
and spy work for the Confederate leaders as were their men-folk.Famous
among these fearless girls who knew every inch of the regions in which
they lived was Nancy Hart.So valuable was her work as a guide, so
cleverly and often had she led Jackson's cavalry upon the Federal outposts
in West Virginia, that the Northern Government offered a large reward for
her capture.Lieutenant-Colonel Starr of the Ninth West Virginia finally
caught her at Summerville in July, 1862.While in a temporary prison, she
faced the camera for the first time in her life, displaying more alarm in
front of the innocent contrivance than if it had been a body of Federal
soldiery.She posed for an itinerant photographer, and her captors placed
the hat decorated with a military feather upon her head.Nancy managed to
get hold of her guard's musket, shot him dead, and escaped on Colonel
Starr's horse to the nearest Confederate detachment.A few days later,
July 25th, she led two hundred troopers under Major Bailey to Summerville.They reached the town at four in the morning, completely surprising two
companies of the Ninth West Virginia.They fired three houses, captured
Colonel Starr, Lieutenant Stivers and other officers, and a large number
of the men, and disappeared immediately over the Sutton road.[Illustration: THE GERMAN DIVISION SENT AGAINST JACKSON

COPYRIGHT BY REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Blenker's division, composed of three brigades of German volunteers, was
detached from the Army of the Potomac in March, 1862, to assist Fremont in
his operations against Jackson.The German troops were but poorly
equipped, many of them carrying old-pattern Belgian and Austrian muskets.When they united with Fremont he was obliged to rearm them with
Springfield rifles from his own stores.When the combined forces met
Jackson and Ewell at Cross Keys, five of Blenker's regiments were sent
forward to the first attack.In the picture Brigadier-General Louis
Blenker is standing, with his hand on his belt, before the door.At his

THE SEVEN DAYS' BATTLES

    McClellan's one hope, one purpose, was to march his army out of the
    swamps and escape from the ceaseless Confederate assaults to a point
    on James River where the resistless fire of the gunboats might protect
    his men from further attack and give them a chance to rest.To that
    end, he retreated night and day, standing at bay now and then as the
    hunted stag does, and fighting desperately for the poor privilege of
    running away.And the splendid fighting of his men was a tribute to the skill and
    genius with which he had created an effective army out of what he had
    described as "regiments cowering upon the banks of the Potomac, some
    perfectly raw, others dispirited by recent defeat, others going home."Out of a demoralized and disorganized mass reenforced by utterly
    untrained civilians, McClellan had within a few months created an army
    capable of stubbornly contesting every inch of ground even while
    effecting a retreat the very thought of which might well have
    disorganized an army.--_George Cary Eggleston, in "The History of the
    Confederate War."_


General Lee was determined that the operations in front of Richmond should
not degenerate into a siege, and that the Army of Northern Virginia should
no longer be on the defensive.To this end, early in the summer of 1862,
he proceeded to increase his fighting force so as to make it more nearly
equal in number to that of his antagonist.Every man who could be spared
from other sections of the South was called to Richmond.Numerous
earthworks soon made their appearance along the roads and in the fields
about the Confederate capital, giving the city the appearance of a
fortified camp.The new commander in an address to the troops said that
the army had made its last retreat.Meanwhile, with the spires of Richmond in view, the Army of the Potomac
was acclimating itself to a Virginia summer.The whole face of the country
for weeks had been a veritable bog.Now that the sweltering heat of June
was coming on, the malarious swamps were fountains of disease.The
polluted waters of the sluggish streams soon began to tell on the health
of the men.Malaria and typhoid were prevalent; the hospitals were
crowded, and the death rate was appalling.Such conditions were not inspiring to either general or army.McClellan
was still hoping for substantial reenforcements.McDowell, with his forty
thousand men, had been promised him, but he was doomed to disappointment
from that source.Yet in the existing state of affairs he dared not be
inactive.South of the Chickahominy, the army was almost secure from
surprise, owing to well-protected rifle-pits flanked by marshy thickets or
covered with felled trees.But the Federal forces were still divided by
the fickle stream, and this was a constant source of anxiety to the
commander.He proceeded to transfer all of his men to the Richmond side of
the river, excepting the corps of Franklin and Fitz John Porter.About the
middle of June, General McCall with a force of eleven thousand men joined
the Federal army north of the Chickahominy, bringing the entire fighting
strength to about one hundred and five thousand.So long as there remained
the slightest hope of additional soldiers, it was impossible to withdraw
all of the army from the York side of the Peninsula, and it remained
divided.That was a brilliant initial stroke of the Confederate general when he
sent his famous cavalry leader, J. E. B. Stuart, with about twelve hundred
Virginia troopers, to encircle the army of McClellan.Veiling his
intentions with the utmost secrecy, Stuart started June 12, 1862, in the
direction of Fredericksburg as if to reenforce "Stonewall" Jackson.The
first night he bivouacked in the pine woods of Hanover.No fires were
kindled, and when the morning dawned, his men swung upon their mounts
without the customary bugle-call of "Boots and Saddles."Turning to the
east, he surprised and captured a Federal picket; swinging around a corner
of the road, he suddenly came upon a squadron of Union cavalry.The
Confederate yell rent the air and a swift, bold charge by the Southern
troopers swept the foe on.They had not traveled far when they came again to a force drawn up in
columns of fours, ready to dispute the passage of the road.This time the
Federals were about to make the charge.A squadron of the Confederates
moved forward to meet them.Some Union skirmishers in their effort to get
to the main body of their troops swept into the advancing Confederates and
carried the front ranks of the squadron with them.These isolated
Confederates found themselves in an extremely perilous position, being
gradually forced into the Federal main body.Before they could extricate
themselves, nearly every one in the unfortunate front rank was shot or cut
down.The Southern cavalrymen swept on and presently found themselves nearing
the York River Railroad--McClellan's supply line.As they approached
Tunstall's Station they charged down upon it, with their characteristic
yell, completely surprising a company of Federal infantry stationed there.Telegraph wires were cut and a tree felled
across the track to obstruct the road.This had hardly been done before
the shriek of a locomotive was heard.A train bearing Union troops came
thundering along, approaching the station.The engineer, taking in the
situation at a glance, put on a full head of steam and made a rush for the
obstruction, which was easily brushed aside.As the train went through a
cut the Confederates fired upon it, wounding and killing some of the
Federal soldiers in the cars.Riding all through a moonlit night, the raiders reached Sycamore Ford of
the Chickahominy at break of day.As usual this erratic stream was
overflowing its banks.They started to ford it, but finding that it would
be a long and wearisome task, a bridge was hastily improvised at another
place where the passage was made with more celerity.Now, on the south
bank of the river, haste was made for the confines of Richmond, where, at
dawn of the following day, the troopers dropped from their saddles, a
weary but happy body of cavalry.Lee thus obtained exact and detailed information of the position of
McClellan's army, and he laid out his campaign accordingly.Meanwhile his
own forces in and about Richmond were steadily increasing.He was planning
for an army of nearly one hundred thousand and he now demonstrated his
ability as a strategist.Word had been despatched to Jackson in the
Shenandoah to bring his troops to fall upon the right wing of McClellan's
army.At the same time Lee sent General Whiting north to make a feint of
joining Jackson and moving upon Washington.The authorities at Washington were frightened, and McClellan
received no more reenforcements.Jackson now began a hide-and-seek game
among the mountains, and managed to have rumors spread of his army being
in several places at the same time, while skilfully veiling his actual
movements.It was not until the 25th of June that McClellan had definite knowledge of
Jackson's whereabouts.He was then located at Ashland, north of the
Chickahominy, within striking distance of the Army of the Potomac.McClellan was surprised but he was not unprepared.Seven days before he
had arranged for a new base of supplies on the James, which would now
prove useful if he were driven south of the Chickahominy.On the very day he heard of Jackson's arrival at Ashland, McClellan was
pushing his men forward to begin his siege of Richmond--that variety of
warfare which his engineering soul loved so well.His advance guard was
within four miles of the Confederate capital.His strong fortifications
were bristling upon every vantage point, and his fond hope was that within
a few days, at most, his efficient artillery, for which the Army of the
Potomac was famous, would be belching forth its sheets of fire and lead
into the beleagured city.In front of the Union encampment, near Fair
Oaks, was a thick entanglement of scrubby pines, vines, and ragged bushes,
full of ponds and marshes.This strip of woodland was less than five
hundred yards wide.Beyond it was an open field half a mile in width.The
Union soldiers pressed through the thicket to see what was on the other
side and met the Confederate pickets among the trees.Upon emerging into the open, the Federal troops found it
filled with rifle-pits, earthworks, and redoubts.At once they were met
with a steady and incessant fire, which continued from eight in the
morning until five in the afternoon.At times the contest almost reached
the magnitude of a battle, and in the end the Union forces occupied the
former position of their antagonists.This passage of arms, sometimes
called the affair of Oak Grove or the Second Battle of Fair Oaks, was the
prelude to the Seven Days' Battles.The following day, June 26th, had been set by General "Stonewall" Jackson
as the date on which he would join Lee, and together they would fall upon
the right wing of the Army of the Potomac.The Federals north of the
Chickahominy were under the direct command of General Fitz John Porter.Defensive preparations had been made on an extensive scale.Field works,
heavily armed with artillery, and rifle-pits, well manned, covered the
roads and open fields and were often concealed by timber from the eye of
the opposing army.The extreme right of the Union line lay near
Mechanicsville on the upper Chickahominy.A tributary of this stream from
the north was Beaver Dam Creek, upon whose left bank was a steep bluff,
commanding the valley to the west.This naturally strong position, now
well defended, was almost impregnable to an attack from the front.Before sunrise of the appointed day the Confederate forces were at the
Chickahominy bridges, awaiting the arrival of Jackson.To reach these some
of the regiments had marched the greater part of the night.Noon passed and
Jackson had not arrived.At three o'clock, General A. P. Hill, growing
impatient, decided to put his troops in motion.Crossing at Meadow Bridge,
he marched his men along the north side of the Chickahominy, and at
Mechanicsville was joined by the commands of Longstreet and D. H. Hill.Driving the Union outposts to cover, the Confederates swept across the low
approach to Beaver Dam Creek.A murderous fire from the batteries on the
cliff poured into their ranks.Gallantly the attacking columns withstood
the deluge of leaden hail and drew near the creek.A few of the more
aggressive reached the opposite bank but their repulse was severe.Later in the afternoon relief was sent to Hill, who again attempted to
force the Union position at Ellerson's Mill, where the <DW72> of the west
bank came close to the borders of the little stream.From across the open
fields, in full view of the defenders of the cliff, the Confederates moved
down the <DW72>.They were in range of the Federal batteries, but the fire
was reserved.Every artilleryman was at his post ready to fire at the
word; the soldiers were in the rifle-pits sighting along the glittering
barrels of their muskets with fingers on the triggers.As the approaching
columns reached the stream they turned with the road that ran parallel to
the bank.From every waiting field-piece the shells came screaming through the air.Volley after volley of musketry was poured into the flanks of the marching
Southerners.The hillside was soon covered with the victims of the gallant
charge.Twilight fell upon the warring troops and there were no signs of a
cessation of the unequal combat.Night fell, and still from the heights
the lurid flames burst in a display of glorious pyrotechnics.It was nine
o'clock when Hill finally drew back his shattered regiments, to await the
coming of the morning.The Forty-fourth Georgia regiment suffered most in
the fight; three hundred and thirty-five being the dreadful toll, in dead
and wounded, paid for its efforts to break down the Union position.Dropping back to the rear this ill-fated regiment attempted to re-form its
broken ranks, but its officers were all among those who had fallen.Both
armies now prepared for another day and a renewal of the conflict.The action at Beaver Dam Creek convinced McClellan that Jackson was really
approaching with a large force, and he decided to begin his change of base
from the Pamunkey to the James, leaving Porter and the Fifth Corps still
on the left bank of the Chickahominy, to prevent Jackson's fresh troops
from interrupting this great movement.It was, indeed, a gigantic
undertaking, for it involved marching an army of a hundred thousand men,
including cavalry and artillery, across the marshy peninsula.A train of
five thousand heavily loaded wagons and many siege-guns had to be
transported; nearly three thousand cattle on the hoof had to be driven.From White House the supplies could be shipped by the York River Railroad
as far as Savage's Station.Thence to the James, a distance of seventeen
miles, they had to be carried overland along a road intersected by many
others from which a watchful opponent might easily attack.General Casey's
troops, guarding the supplies at White House, were transferred by way of
the York and the James to Harrison's Landing on the latter river.The
transports were loaded with all the material they could carry.The rest
was burned, or put in cars.These cars, with locomotives attached, were
then run into the river.On the night of June 26th, McCall's Federal division, at Beaver Dam Creek,
was directed to fall back to the bridges across the Chickahominy near
Gaines' Mill and there make a stand, for the purpose of holding the
Confederate army.During the night the wagon trains and heavy guns were
quietly moved across the river.Just before daylight the operation of
removing the troops began.The Confederates were equally alert, for about
the same time they opened a heavy fire on the retreating columns.This
march of five miles was a continuous skirmish; but the Union forces, ably
and skilfully handled, succeeded in reaching their new position on the
Chickahominy heights.The morning of the new day was becoming hot and sultry as the men of the
Fifth Corps made ready for action in their new position.The selection of
this ground had been well made; it occupied a series of heights fronted on
the west by a sickle-shaped stream.The battle-lines followed the course
of this creek, in the arc of a circle curving outward in the direction of
the approaching army.The land beyond the creek was an open country,
through which Powhite Creek meandered sluggishly, and beyond this a wood
densely tangled with undergrowth.Around the Union position were also many
patches of wooded land affording cover for the troops and screening the
reserves from view.Porter had learned from deserters and others that Jackson's forces, united
to those of Longstreet and the two Hills, were advancing with grim
determination to annihilate the Army of the Potomac.He had less than
eighteen thousand men to oppose the fifty thousand Confederates.To
protect the Federals, trees had been felled along a small portion of their
front, out of which barriers protected with rails and knapsacks were
erected.Porter had considerable artillery, but only a small part of it
could be used.It was two o'clock, on June 27th, when General A. P. Hill
swung his division into line for the attack.He was unsupported by the
other divisions, which had not yet arrived, but his columns moved rapidly
toward the Union front.The assault was terrific, but twenty-six guns
threw a hail-storm of lead into his ranks.Under the cover of this
magnificent execution of artillery, the infantry sent messages of death to
the approaching lines of gray.The Confederate front recoiled from the incessant outpour of grape,
canister, and shell.The heavy cloud of battle smoke rose lazily through
the air, twisting itself among the trees and settling over the forest like
a pall.The tremendous momentum of the repulse threw the Confederates into
great confusion.Men were separated from their companies and for a time it
seemed as if a rout were imminent.The Federals, pushing out from under
the protection of their great guns, now became the assailants.The
Southerners were being driven back.Others threw themselves on the ground to escape the withering fire, while
some tenaciously held their places.General
Slocum arrived with his division of Franklin's corps, and his arrival
increased the ardor of the victorious Federals.It was then that Lee ordered a general attack upon the entire Union front.Reenforcements were brought to take the place of the shattered regiments.The engagement began with a sharp artillery fire from the Confederate
guns.Then the troops moved forward, once more to assault the Union
position.In the face of a heavy fire they rushed across the sedgy
lowland, pressed up the hillside at fearful sacrifice and pushed against
the Union front.It was a death grapple for the mastery of the field.General Lee, sitting on his horse on an eminence where he could observe
the progress of the battle, saw, coming down the road, General Hood, of
Jackson's corps, who was bringing his brigade into the fight.Riding
forward to meet him, Lee directed that he should try to break the line.Hood, disposing his men for the attack, sent them forward, but, reserving
the Fourth Texas for his immediate command, he marched it into an open
field, halted, and addressed it, giving instructions that no man should
fire until ordered and that all should keep together in line.The forward march was sounded, and the intrepid Hood, leading his men,
started for the Union breastworks eight hundred yards away.They moved at
a rapid pace across the open, under a continually increasing shower of
shot and shell.At every step the ranks grew thinner and thinner.As they
reached the crest of a small ridge, one hundred and fifty yards from the
Union line, the batteries in front and on the flank sent a storm of shell
and canister plowing into their already depleted files.They quickened
their pace as they passed down the <DW72> and across the creek.Not a shot
had they fired and amid the sulphurous atmosphere of battle, with the wing
of death hovering over all, they fixed bayonets and dashed up the hill
into the Federal line.With a shout they plunged through the felled timber
and over the breastworks.The Union line had been pierced and was giving
way.It was falling back toward the Chickahominy bridges, and the retreat
was threatening to develop into a general rout.The twilight was closing
in and the day was all but lost to the Army of the Potomac.Now a great
shout was heard from the direction of the bridge and, pushing through the
stragglers at the river bank were seen the brigades of French and Meagher,
detached from Sumner's corps, coming to the rescue.General Meagher, in
his shirt sleeves, was leading his men up the bluff and confronted the
Confederate battle line.This put a stop to the pursuit and as night was
at hand the Southern soldiers withdrew.The battle of Gaines' Mill, or the
Chickahominy, was over.When Lee came to the banks of the little river the next morning he found
his opponent had crossed over and destroyed the bridges.The Army of the
Potomac was once more united.During the day the Federal wagon trains were
safely passed over White Oak Swamp and then moved on toward the James
River.Lee did not at first divine McClellan's intention.He still
believed that the Federal general would retreat down the Peninsula, and
hesitated therefore to cross the Chickahominy and give up the command of
the lower bridges.But now on the 29th the signs of the movement to the
James were unmistakable.Early on that morning Longstreet and A. P. Hill
were ordered to recross the Chickahominy by the New Bridge and Huger and
Magruder were sent in hot pursuit of the Federal forces.It was the brave
Sumner who covered the march of the retreating army, and as he stood in
the open field near Savage's Station he looked out over the plain and saw
with satisfaction the last of the ambulances and wagons making their way
toward the new haven on the James.In the morning of that same day he had already held at bay the forces of
Magruder at Allen's Farm.On his way from Fair Oaks, which he left at
daylight, he had halted his men at what is known as the "Peach Orchard,"
and from nine o'clock till eleven had resisted a spirited fire of musketry
and artillery.And now as the grim warrior, on this Sunday afternoon in
June, turned his eyes toward the Chickahominy he saw a great cloud of dust
rising on the horizon.It was raised by the troops of General Magruder who
was pressing close behind the Army of the Potomac.The Southern field-guns
were placed in position.A contrivance, consisting of a heavy gun mounted
on a railroad car and called the "Land Merrimac," was pushed into position
and opened fire upon the Union forces.The battle began with a fine play
of artillery.For an hour not a musket was fired.The army of blue
remained motionless.Then the mass of gray moved across the field and from
the Union guns the long tongues of flame darted into the ranks before
them.The charge was met with vigor and soon the battle raged over the
entire field.Both sides stood their ground till darkness again closed the
contest, and nearly eight hundred brave men had fallen in this Sabbath
evening's battle.Before midnight Sumner had withdrawn his men and was
following after the wagon trains.The Confederates were pursuing McClellan's army in two columns, Jackson
closely following Sumner, while Longstreet was trying to cut off the Union
forces by a flank movement.On the last day of June, at high noon, Jackson
reached the White Oak Swamp.He attempted to ford
the passage, but the Union troops were there to prevent it.While Jackson
was trying to force his way across the stream, there came to him the sound
of a desperate battle being fought not more than two miles away, but he
was powerless to give aid.Longstreet and A. P. Hill had come upon the Federal regiments at Glendale,
near the intersection of the Charles City road, guarding the right flank
of the retreat.It was Longstreet who, about half-past two, made one of
his characteristic onslaughts on that part of the Union army led by
General McCall.Each brigade seemed to act on its own behalf.They hammered
here, there, and everywhere.Repulsed at one place they charged at
another.The Eleventh Alabama, rushing out from behind a dense wood,
charged across the open field in the face of the Union batteries.The men
had to run a distance of six hundred yards.A heavy and destructive fire
poured into their lines, but on they came, trailing their guns.The
batteries let loose grape and canister, while volley after volley of
musketry sent its death-dealing messages among the Southerners.But
nothing except death itself could check their impetuous charge.When two
hundred yards away they raised the Confederate yell and rushed for
Randol's battery.Pausing for an instant they deliver a volley and attempt to seize the
guns.Bayonets are crossed and men engage in a hand-to-hand struggle.The
contending masses rush together, asking and giving no quarter and
struggling like so many tigers.Darkness is closing on the fearful scene,
yet the fighting continues with unabated ferocity.There are the shouts of
command, the clash and the fury of the battle, the sulphurous smoke, the
flashes of fire streaking through the air, the yells of defiance, the
thrust, the parry, the thud of the clubbed musket, the hiss of the bullet,
the spouting blood, the death-cry, and beneath all lie the bodies of
America's sons, some in blue and some in gray.While Lee and his army were held in check by the events of June 30th at
White Oak Swamp and the other battle at Glendale or Nelson's Farm, the
last of the wagon trains had arrived safely at Malvern Hill.The contest
had hardly closed and the smoke had scarcely lifted from the blood-soaked
field, when the Union forces were again in motion toward the James.By
noon on July 1st the last division reached the position where McClellan
decided to turn again upon his assailants.He had not long to wait, for
the Confederate columns, led by Longstreet, were close on his trail, and a
march of a few miles brought them to the Union outposts.They found the
Army of the Potomac admirably situated to give defensive battle.Malvern
Hill, a plateau, a mile and a half long and half as broad, with its top
almost bare of woods, commanded a view of the country over which the
Confederate army must approach.Along the western face of this plateau
there are deep ravines falling abruptly in the direction of the James
River; on the north and east is a gentle <DW72> to the plain beneath,
bordered by a thick forest.Around the summit of the hill, General
McClellan had placed tier after tier of batteries, arranged like an
amphitheater.Surmounting these on the crest were massed seven of his
heaviest siege-guns.His army surrounded this hill, its left flank being
protected by the gunboats on the river.The morning and early afternoon were occupied with many Confederate
attacks, sometimes formidable in their nature, but Lee planned for no
general move until he could bring up a force that he considered sufficient
to attack the strong Federal position.The Confederate orders were to
advance when the signal, a yell, cheer, or shout from the men of
Armistead's brigade, was given.Late in the afternoon General D. H. Hill heard some shouting, followed by
a roar of musketry.No other general seems to have heard it, for Hill made
his attack alone.It was gallantly done, but no army could have withstood
the galling fire of the batteries of the Army of the Potomac as they were
massed upon Malvern Hill.All during the evening, brigade after brigade
tried to force the Union lines.The gunners stood coolly and manfully by
their batteries.The Confederates were not able to make concerted efforts,
but the battle waxed hot nevertheless.They were forced to breast one of
the most devastating storms of lead and canister to which an assaulting
army has ever been subjected.The round shot and grape cut through the
branches of the trees and the battle-field was soon in a cloud of smoke.Column after column of Southern soldiers rushed up to the death-dealing
cannon, only to be mowed down.The thinned and ragged lines, with a valor
born of desperation, rallied again and again to the charge, but to no
avail.The batteries on the heights still hurled their missiles of death.The field below was covered with the dead and wounded of the Southland.The gunboats in the river made the battle scene more awe-inspiring with
their thunderous cannonading.Their heavy shells shrieked through the
forest, and great limbs were torn from the trees as they hurtled by in
their outburst of fury.The combatants were no longer distinguishable except by
the sheets of flame.It was nine o'clock before the guns ceased their
fire, and only an occasional shot rang out over the bloody field of
Malvern Hill.The courageous though defeated Confederate, looking up the next day
through the drenching rain to where had stood the embrasured wall with its
grim batteries and lines of blue, that spoke death to so many of his
companions-in-arms, saw only deserted ramparts.The Union army had
retreated in the darkness of the night.But this time no foe harassed its
march.Unmolested, it sought its new camp at Harrison's Landing, where it
remained until August 3d, when, as President Lincoln had been convinced of
the impracticability of operating from the James River as a base, orders
were issued by General Halleck for the withdrawal of the Army of the
Potomac from the Peninsula.The net military result of the Seven Days was a disappointment to the
South.Although thankful that the siege of Richmond had been raised, the
Southern public believed that McClellan should not have been allowed to
reach the James River with his army intact."That army," Eggleston states, "splendidly organized, superbly equipped,
and strengthened rather than weakened in morale, lay securely at rest on
the James River, within easy striking distance of Richmond.There was no
knowing at what moment McClellan might hurl it again upon Richmond or upon
that commanding key to Richmond--the Petersburg position.In the hands of
a capable commander McClellan's army would at this time have been a more
serious menace than ever to the Confederate capital, for it now had an
absolutely secure and unassailable base of operations, while its fighting
quality had been improved rather than impaired by its seven days of
battling."General Lee's own official comment on the military problem involved and
the difficulties encountered was: "Under ordinary circumstances the
Federal army should have been destroyed.Its escape was due to the causes
already stated.Prominent among these is the want of correct and timely
information.This fact, attributable chiefly to the character of the
country, enabled General McClellan skilfully to conceal his retreat and to
add much to the obstructions with which nature had beset the way of our
pursuing columns; but regret that more was not accomplished gives way to
gratitude to the Sovereign Ruler of the Universe for the results
achieved."Whatever the outcome of the Seven Days' Battle another year was to
demonstrate beyond question that the wounding of General Johnston at Fair
Oaks had left the Confederate army with an even abler commander.On such a
field as Chancellorsville was to be shown the brilliancy of Lee as leader,
and his skilful maneuvers leading to the invasion of the North.And the
succeeding volume will tell, on the other hand, how strong and compact a
fighting force had been forged from the raw militia and volunteers of the
North.[Illustration: McDOWELL AND McCLELLAN--TWO UNION LEADERS WHOSE PLANS
"STONEWALL" JACKSON FOILED

COPYRIGHT BY REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]In General McClellan's plan for the Peninsula Campaign of 1862, General
McDowell, with the First Army Corps of 37,000 men, was assigned a most
important part, that of joining him before Richmond.Lincoln had
reluctantly consented to the plan, fearing sufficient protection was not
provided for Washington.By the battle of Kernstown, March 23d, in the
Valley of Virginia, Jackson, though defeated, so alarmed the
Administration that McDowell was ordered to remain at Manassas to protect
the capital.The reverse at Kernstown was therefore a real triumph for
Jackson, but with his small force he had to keep up the game of holding
McDowell, Banks, and Fremont from reenforcing McClellan.If he failed,
80,000 troops might move up to Richmond from the west while McClellan was
approaching from the North.But Jackson, on May 23d and 25th, surprised
Banks' forces at Front Royal and Winchester, forcing a retreat to the
Potomac.At the news of this event McDowell was ordered not to join
McClellan in front of Richmond.[Illustration: JOHNSTON AND LEE--A PHOTOGRAPH OF 1869._Copyright by Review of Reviews Co._]

These men look enough alike to be brothers.They were so in arms, at West
Point, in Mexico and throughout the war.General Joseph E. Johnston (on
the left), who had led the Confederate forces since Bull Run, was wounded
at Fair Oaks.That wound gave Robert E. Lee (on the right) his opportunity
to act as leader.After Fair Oaks, Johnston retired from the command of
the army defending Richmond.The new commander immediately grasped the
possibilities of the situation which confronted him.The promptness and
completeness with which he blighted McClellan's high hopes of reaching
Richmond showed at one stroke that the Confederacy had found its great
general.It was only through much sifting that the North at last picked
military leaders that could rival him in the field.[Illustration: THE FLEET THAT FED THE ARMY]

White House Landing came the steam and sailing vessels laden with supplies
for McClellan's second attempt to reach Richmond.Tons of ammunition and
thousands of rations were sent forward from here to the army on the
Chickahominy in June, 1862.A short month was enough to cause McClellan to
again change his plans, and the army base was moved to the James River.The Richmond and York Railroad was lit up by burning cars along its course
to the Chickahominy.Little was left to the Confederates save the charred
ruins of the White House itself.[Illustration: ELLERSON'S MILL--WHERE HILL ASSAULTED.]Not until after nightfall of June 26, 1862, did the Confederates of
General A. P. Hill's division cease their assaults upon this position
where General McCall's men were strongly entrenched.Time after time the
Confederates charged over the ground we see here at Ellerson's Mill, near
Mechanicsville.Till 9 o'clock at night they continued to pour volleys at
the position, and then at last withdrew.The victory was of little use to
the Federals, for Jackson on the morrow, having executed one of the
flanking night marches at which he was an adept, fell upon the Federal
rear at Gaines' Mill.[Illustration: THE WASTE OF WAR

COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.Railroad trains loaded with tons of food and ammunition were run
deliberately at full speed off the embankment shown in the left
foreground.They plunged headlong into the waters of the Pamunkey.This
was the readiest means that McClellan could devise for keeping his immense
quantity of stores out of the hands of the Confederates in his hasty
change of base from White House to the James after Gaines' Mill.This was
the bridge of the Richmond and York River Railroad, and was destroyed June
28, 1862, to render the railroad useless to the Confederates.[Illustration: THE BRIDGE THAT STOOD]

The force under General McCall was stationed by McClellan on June 19,
1862, to observe the Meadow and Mechanicsville bridges over the
Chickahominy which had only partially been destroyed.On the afternoon of
June 26th, General A. P. Hill crossed at Meadow Bridge, driving the Union
skirmish-line back to Beaver Dam Creek.The divisions of D. H. Hill and
Longstreet had been waiting at Mechanicsville Bridge (shown in this
photograph) since 8 A.M.for A. P. Hill to open the way for them to cross.They passed over in time to bear a decisive part in the Confederate attack
at Gaines' Mill on the 27th.[Illustration: DOING DOUBLE DUTY

engineers suspect, when they built this bridge, early in June, 1862, as a
means of communication between the divided wings of McClellan's army on
the Chickahominy that it would be of incalculable service during battle.When the right wing, under General Fitz John Porter, was engaged on the
field of Gaines' Mill against almost the entire army of Lee, across this
bridge the division of General Slocum marched from its position in the
trenches in front of Richmond on the south bank of the river to the
support of Porter's men.The battle lasted until nightfall and then the
Federal troops moved across this bridge and rejoined the main forces of
the Federal army.Woodbury's engineers built several bridges across the
Chickahominy, but among them all the bridge named for their commander
proved to be, perhaps, the most serviceable.[Illustration: A VAIN RIDE TO SAFETY]

During the retreat after Gaines' Mill, McClellan's army was straining
every nerve to extricate itself and present a strong front to Lee before
he could strike a telling blow at its untenable position.Wagon trains
were struggling across the almost impassable White Oak Swamp, while the
troops were striving to hold Savage's Station to protect the movement.Thither on flat cars were sent the wounded as we see them in the picture.The rear guard of the Army of the Potomac had hastily provided such field
hospital facilities as they could.We see the camp near the railroad with
the passing wagon trains in the lower picture.But attention to these
wounded men was, perforce, secondary to the necessity of holding the
position.Their hopes of relief from their suffering were to be blighted.Lee was about to fall upon the Federal rear guard at Savage's Station.Instead of to a haven of refuge, these men were being railroaded toward
the field of carnage, where they must of necessity be left by their
retreating companions.[Illustration: THE STAND AT SAVAGE'S STATION

lingering for months in the military prisons of the South.The brave

days of June, 1862.On the morning of the 30th, the rear-guard of the army
was hastily tramping after them, and by ten o'clock had safely crossed and
destroyed the bridge.They had escaped in the nick of time, for at noon
"Stonewall" Jackson opened fire upon Richardson's division and a terrific
artillery battle ensued for the possession of this, the single crossing by
which it was possible to attack McClellan's rear.The Federal batteries
were compelled to retire but Jackson's crossing was prevented on that day
by the infantry.[Illustration: HEROES OF MALVERN HILL]

after the victory of July 1, 1862, and the army marched to a new base
farther down the James, where the heavy losses of men and supplies during
the Seven Days could be made up without danger and delay.Harrison's

up.With apparent reluctance he agreed to a truce of two hours in which
the Confederates might bury the dead they left on the hillside the day
before.Later, with an increased show of unwillingness, he extended the
truce for another two hours.Just before they expired, Frank's Battery
arrived to his support, with the news that the Army of the Potomac was
safe.Colonel Averell rejoined it without the loss of a man.[Illustration: OFFICERS OF THE THIRD PENNSYLVANIA CAVALRY]

AFTER THE SEVEN DAYS

Within a week of the occupation of Harrison's Landing, McClellan's
position had become so strong that the Federal commander no longer
anticipated an attack by the Confederate forces.General Lee saw that his
opponent was flanked on each side by a creek and that approach to his
front was commanded by the guns in the entrenchments and those of the
Federal navy in the river.Lee therefore deemed it inexpedient to attack,
especially as his troops were in poor condition owing to the incessant
marching and fighting of the Seven Days.Rest was what both armies needed
most, and on July 8th the Confederate forces returned to the vicinity of
Richmond.McClellan scoured the country before he was satisfied of the
Confederate withdrawal.The Third and Fourth Pennsylvania cavalry made a
reconnaisance to Charles City Court House and beyond, and General Averell
reported on July 11th that there were no Southern troops south of the
lower Chickahominy.His scouting expeditions extended in the direction of
Richmond and up the Chickahominy.[Illustration: CHARLES CITY COURT HOUSE, VIRGINIA, JULY, 1862

[Illustration]

THE MAN WHO KEPT THE KEY IN THE WEST

GENERAL W. S. ROSECRANS

The possession of Corinth, Miss., meant the control of the railroads
without which the Federal armies could not push down the Mississippi
Valley and eastward into Tennessee.Autumn found Rosecrans with about
23,000 men in command at the post where were vast quantities of military
stores.On October 3, the indomitable Confederate leaders, Price and Van
Dorn, appeared before Corinth, and Rosecrans believing the movement to be
a feint sent forward a brigade to an advanced position on a hill.A sharp
battle ensued and in a brilliant charge the Confederates at last possessed
the hill.Convinced that there was really to be a determined assault on
Corinth, Rosecrans disposed his forces during the night.Just before dawn
the Confederate cannonade began, the early daylight was passed in
skirmishing, while the artillery duel grew hotter.Then a glittering
column of Price's men burst from the woods.Grape and canister were poured
into them, but on they came, broke through the Federal center and drove
back their opponents to the square of the town.Here the Confederates were
at last swept back.But ere that Van Dorn's troops had hurled themselves
on Battery Robinett to the left of the Federal line, and fought their way
over the parapet and into the battery.Federal
troops well placed in concealment rose up and poured volley after volley
into them.Rosecrans by a
well-planned defense had kept the key to Grant's subsequent control of the
West.[Illustration: GENERAL EARL VAN DORN, C. S.THE CONFEDERATE COMMANDER AT CORINTH

General Earl Van Dorn was born in Mississippi in 1821; he was graduated
from West Point in 1842, and was killed in a personal quarrel in 1863.Early in the war General Van Dorn had distinguished himself by capturing
the steamer "Star of the West" at Indianola, Texas.He was of a
tempestuous nature and had natural fighting qualities.During the month of
August he commanded all the Confederate troops in Mississippi except those
under General Price, and it was his idea to form a combined movement with
the latter's forces and expel the invading Federals from the northern
portion of his native State and from eastern Tennessee.The concentration
was made and the Confederate army, about 22,000 men, was brought into the
disastrous battle of Corinth.Brave were the charges made on the
entrenched positions, but without avail.[Illustration: GENERAL STERLING PRICE, C. S.THE CONFEDERATE SECOND IN COMMAND

General Sterling Price was a civilian who by natural inclination turned to
soldiering.He had been made a brigadier-general during the Mexican War,
but early allied himself with the cause of the Confederacy.At Pea Ridge,
only seven months before the battle of Corinth, he had been wounded.Of
the behavior of his men, though they were defeated and turned back on the
4th, he wrote that it was with pride that sisters and daughters of the
South could say of the officers and men, "My brother, father, fought at
Corinth."General Van Dorn, in referring to
the end of that bloody battle, wrote these pathetic words: "Exhausted from
loss of sleep, wearied from hard marching and fighting, companies and
regiments without officers, our troops--let no one censure them--gave way.[Illustration: BEFORE THE SOD HID THEM

[Illustration: GENERAL JOHN POPE]

THE UNFORTUNATE COMMANDER OF THE ARMY OF VIRGINIA

A SWIFT TURN OF FORTUNE'S WHEEL

Perhaps there is no more pathetic figure in the annals of the War than
Pope.In the West, that fiery furnace where the North's greatest generals
were already being molded, he stood out most prominently in the Spring of
1862.At Washington, the administration was cudgeling its brains for means
to meet the popular clamor for an aggressive campaign against Lee after
the Peninsula fiasco.Pope was sent for and arrived in Washington in June.When the plan to place him at the head of an army whose three corps
commanders all outranked him, was proposed, he begged to be sent back
West.But he was finally persuaded to undertake a task, the magnitude of
which was not yet appreciated at the North.During a month of preparation
he was too easily swayed by the advice and influenced by the plans of
civilians, and finally issued a flamboyant address to his army ending with
the statement, "My headquarters will be in the saddle."When this was
shown to Lee, he grimly commented, "Perhaps his headquarters will be where
his hindquarters ought to be."There followed the brief campaign, the
stunning collision with the solid front of Stonewall Jackson at Cedar
Mountain, and the clever strategy that took Pope at a disadvantage on the
old battlefield of Bull Run.Thence his army retreated more badly beaten
from a military standpoint than the rout which fled the same field a year
before.A brief summer had marked the rise and fall of Pope.Two years
later Sherman bade good-bye to his friend Grant also summoned from the
West."Remember Pope," was the gist of his warning; "don't stay in
Washington; keep in the field."CEDAR MOUNTAIN

    The Army of Virginia, under Pope, is now to bear the brunt of Lee's
    assault, while the Army of the Potomac is dismembered and sent back
    whence it came, to add in driblets to Pope's effective.--_Colonel
    Theodore A. Dodge, U. S. A., in "A Bird's-Eye View of the Civil War."_


General George B. McClellan, with all his popularity at the beginning, had
failed in his Peninsula campaign to fulfil the expectations of the great
impatient public of the North.At the same time, while the Army of the
Potomac had as yet won no great victories, the men of the West could
triumphantly exhibit the trophies won at Donelson, at Pea Ridge, at
Shiloh, and at Island No.The North thereupon came to believe that the
Western leaders were more able than those of the East.This belief was
shared by the President and his Secretary of War and it led to the
determination to call on the West for help.The first to be called was General John Pope, who had won national fame by
capturing New Madrid and Island No.In answer
to a telegram from Secretary Stanton, Pope came to Washington in June,
1862.The secretary disclosed the plans on which he and President Lincoln
had agreed, that a new army, to be known as the Army of Virginia, was to
be created out of three corps, then under the respective commands of
Generals McDowell, N. P. Banks, and John C. Fremont.These corps had been
held from the Peninsula campaign for the purpose of protecting Washington.Pope demurred and begged to be sent back to the West, on the ground that
each of the three corps commanders was his senior in rank and that his
being placed at their head would doubtless create a feeling against him.But his protests were of no avail and he assumed command of the Army of
Virginia on the 26th of June.McDowell and Banks made no protest; but
Fremont refused to serve under one whom he considered his junior, and
resigned his position.His corps was assigned to General Franz Sigel.The new commander, General Pope, on the 14th of July, issued an address to
his army that was hardly in keeping with his modesty in desiring at first
to decline the honor that was offered him."I have come to you from the
West," he proclaimed, "where we have always seen the backs of our
enemies--from an army whose business it has been to seek the adversary and
to beat him when found.... Meantime I desire you to dismiss from your
minds certain phrases which I am sorry to find much in vogue among you.I
hear constantly of... lines of retreat and bases of supplies.Let us
discard such ideas.... Let us look before us and not behind."The immediate object of General Pope was to make the capital secure, to
make advances toward Richmond, and, if possible, to draw a portion of
Lee's army away from McClellan.From
this town, not far from the base of the Blue Ridge Mountains, there was a
railroad connecting it with Richmond--a convenient means of furnishing men
and supplies to the Confederate army.Pope decided to occupy the town and
destroy the railroad.To this end he ordered Banks to Culpeper and thence
to send all his cavalry to Gordonsville, capture the town and tear up ten
or fifteen miles of the railroad in the direction of Richmond.But, as if
a prelude to the series of defeats which General Pope was to suffer in the
next six weeks, he failed in this initial movement.The sagacious Lee had
divined his intention and had sent General "Stonewall" Jackson with his
and General Ewell's divisions on July 13th, to occupy Gordonsville.Ewell
arrived in advance of Jackson and held the town for the Confederates.In the campaign we are describing Jackson was the most active and
conspicuous figure on the Confederate side.He rested at Gordonsville for
two weeks, recuperating his health and that of the army, which had been
much impaired in the malarial district of the Peninsula.The fresh
mountain air blowing down from the Blue Ridge soon brought back their
wonted vigor.On July 27th A. P. Hill was ordered to join him, and the
Confederate leader now had about twenty-five thousand men.The movement on Gordonsville was exactly in accordance with Jackson's own
ideas which he had urged upon Lee.Although believing McClellan to be in
an impregnable position on the Peninsula, it was not less evident to him
that the Union general would be unable to move further until his army had
been reorganized and reenforced.This was the moment, he argued, to strike
in another direction and carry the conflict into the Federal territory.An
army of at least sixty thousand should march into Maryland and appear
before the National Capital.President Davis could not be won over to the
plan while McClellan was still in a position to be reenforced by sea, but
Lee, seeing that McClellan remained inactive, had determined, by sending
Jackson westward, to repeat the successful tactics of the previous spring
in the Shenandoah valley.Such a move might result in the recall of
McClellan.No sooner had Halleck assumed command of all the
Northern armies than the matter of McClellan's withdrawal was agitated and
on August 3d the head of the Army of the Potomac, to his bitter
disappointment, was ordered to join Pope on the Rappahannock.Halleck was
much concerned as to how Lee would act during the Federal evacuation of
the Peninsula, uncertain whether the Confederates would attempt to crush
Pope before McClellan could reenforce him, or whether McClellan would be
attacked as soon as he was out of his strong entrenchments at Harrison's
Landing.The latter of the two possibilities seemed the more probable, and Pope was
therefore ordered to push his whole army toward Gordonsville, in the hope
that Lee, compelled to strengthen Jackson, would be too weak to fall upon
the retiring Army of the Potomac.The Union army now occupied the great triangle formed roughly by the
Rappahannock and the Rapidan rivers and the range of the Blue Ridge
Mountains, with Culpeper Court House as the rallying point.Pope soon
found that the capturing of New Madrid and Island No.10 was easy in
comparison with measuring swords with the Confederate generals in the
East.On August 6th Pope began his general advance upon Gordonsville.Banks
already had a brigade at Culpeper Court House, and this was nearest to
Jackson.The small settlement was the meeting place of four roads by means
of which Pope's army of forty-seven thousand men would be united.Jackson,
informed of the advance, immediately set his three divisions in motion for
Culpeper, hoping to crush Banks, hold the town, and prevent the uniting of
the Army of Virginia.The remainder of Banks's
corps reached Culpeper on the 8th.On the morning of the 9th Jackson
finally got his troops over the Rapidan and the Robertson rivers.Two
miles beyond the latter stream there rose from the plain the <DW72> of
Slaughter Mountain, whose ominous name is more often changed into Cedar.This "mountain" is an isolated foothill of the Blue Ridge, some twenty
miles from the parent range, and a little north of the Rapidan.From its
summit could be seen vast stretches of quiet farmlands which had borne
their annual harvests since the days of the Cavaliers.Its gentle <DW72>s
were covered with forests, which merged at length into waving grain fields
and pasture lands, dotted here and there with rural homes.It was here on
the <DW72> of Cedar Mountain that one of the most severe little battles of
the war took place.On the banks of Cedar Run, seven miles south of Culpeper and but one or
two north of the mountain, Banks's cavalry were waiting to oppose
Jackson's advance.Learning of this the latter halted and waited for an
attack.He placed Ewell's batteries on the <DW72> about two hundred feet
above the valley and sent General Winder to take a strong position on the
left.So admirably was Jackson's army stationed that it would have
required a much larger force, approaching it from the plains, to dislodge
it.And yet, General Banks made an attempt with an army scarcely one-third
as large as that of Jackson.General Pope had made glowing promises of certain success and he well knew
that the whole North was eagerly watching and waiting for him to fulfil
them.He must strike somewhere and do it soon--and here was his chance at
Cedar Mountain.He sent Banks with nearly eight thousand men against this
brilliant Southern commander with an army three times as large, holding a
strong position on a mountain side.Banks with his infantry left Culpeper Court House on the morning of August
9th and reached the Confederate stronghold in the afternoon.He approached
the mountain through open fields in full range of the Confederate cannon,
which presently opened with the roar of thunder.All heedless of danger
the brave men ran up the <DW72> as if to take the foe by storm, when
suddenly they met a brigade of Ewell's division face to face and a brief,
deadly encounter took place.In a few minutes the Confederate right flank
began to waver and would no doubt have been routed but for the timely aid
of another brigade and still another that rushed down the hill and opened
fire on the Federal lines which extended along the eastern bank of Cedar
Run.Meanwhile the Union batteries had been wheeled into position and their
deep roar answered that of the foe on the hill.For two or three hours the
battle continued with the utmost fury.The ground was strewn with dead and
dying and human blood was poured out like water.But the odds were too
great and at length, as the shades of evening were settling over the gory
field, Banks began to withdraw the remnant of his troops.But he left two
thousand of his brave lads--one fourth of his whole army--dead or dying
along the hillside, while the Confederate losses were in excess of
thirteen hundred.The dead and wounded of both armies lay mingled in masses over the whole
battle-field.While the fighting continued, neither side could send aid or
relief to the maimed soldiers, who suffered terribly from thirst and lack
of attention as the sultry day gave place to a close, oppressive night.General Pope had remained at Culpeper, but, hearing the continuous
cannonading and knowing that a sharp engagement was going on, hastened to
the battle-field in the afternoon with a fresh body of troops under
General Ricketts, arriving just before dark.He instantly ordered Banks to
withdraw his right wing so as to make room for Ricketts; but the
Confederates, victorious as they had been, refused to continue the contest
against the reenforcements and withdrew to the woods up the mountain side.Heavy shelling was kept up by the hard-worked artillerymen of both armies
until nearly midnight, while the Federal troops rested on their arms in
line of battle.For two days the armies faced each other across the
valley.Pope's first battle as leader of an
Eastern army had resulted in neither victory nor defeat.[Illustration: A BREATHING SPELL

McClellan went to the Peninsula in March of 1862 he had expected all of
McDowell's Corps to be sent him as reenforcement before he made the final
advance on Richmond.But the brilliant exploits of Jackson in the
Shenandoah required the retention of all the troops in the vicinity of
Washington.A new army, in fact, was created to make the campaign which
Lincoln had originally wanted McClellan to carry out.The command was
given to General John Pope, whose capture of Island No.10 in the
Mississippi had brought him into national importance.The corps of Banks,
Fremont, and McDowell were consolidated to form this new army, called the
"Army of Virginia."General Fremont refused to serve under his junior, and
his force was given to Franz Sigel, who had won fame in 1861 in Missouri.This picture was taken about two weeks after the reorganization was
completed.The soldiers are those of McDowell's Corps.They are on the old

seize Culpeper Court House, but the combat took place in the valley here

The Hero of the Federal Attack.General Samuel W. Crawford, here seen with
his staff, at Cedar Mountain led a charge on the left flank of the
Confederate forces that came near being disastrous for Jackson.At about
six o'clock the brigade was in line.General Williams reported: "At this
time this brigade occupied the interior line of a strip of woods.A field,
varying from 250 to 500 yards in width, lay between it and the next strip
of woods.In moving across this field the three right regiments and the
six companies of the Third Wisconsin were received by a terrific fire of
musketry.The Third Wisconsin especially fell under a partial flank fire
under which Lieut.-Colonel Crane fell and the regiment was obliged to give
way.Of the three remaining regiments which continued the charge
(Twenty-eighth New York, Forty-sixth Pennsylvania, and Fifth Connecticut)
every field-officer and every adjutant was killed or disabled.In the
Twenty-eighth New York every company officer was killed or wounded; in the
Forty-sixth Pennsylvania all but five; in the Fifth Connecticut all but
eight."It was one of the most heroic combats of the war.ALFRED N. DUFFIE]

A Leader of Cavalry.Colonel Alfred N. Duffie was in command of the First
Rhode Island Cavalry, in the Cavalry Brigade of the Second Division of
McDowell's (Third) Corps in Pope's Army of Virginia.The cavalry had been
used pretty well during Pope's advance.On the 8th of August, the day
before the battle of Cedar Mountain, the cavalry had proceeded south to
the house of Dr.That night Duffie was on picket in advance of
General Crawford's troops, which had come up during the day and pitched
camp.The whole division came to his support on the next day.When the
infantry fell back to the protection of the batteries, the cavalry was
ordered to charge the advancing Confederates."Officers and men behaved
admirably, and I cannot speak too highly of the good conduct of all of the
brigade," reported General Bayard.After the battle the cavalry covered
the retreat of the artillery and ambulances.On August 18th, when the
retreat behind the Rappahannoc was ordered, the cavalry again checked the
Confederate advance.During the entire campaign the regiment of Colonel
Duffie did yeoman's service.[Illustration: THE FIRST CLASH

COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.Battlefield of Cedar Mountain, August 9, 1862.Here the Confederate army
in its second advance on Washington first felt out the strength massed
against it.After Lee's brilliant tactics had turned McClellan's Peninsula
Campaign into a fiasco, the Confederate Government resolved to again take
the offensive.Plans were formed for a general invasion of the North, the
objective points ranging from Cincinnati eastward to the Federal capital
and Philadelphia.Immediately after Washington got wind of this, Lincoln
(on August 4th) issued a call for three hundred thousand men, and all
haste was made to rush the forces of McClellan from the Peninsula and of
Cox from West Virginia to the aid of the recently consolidated army under
Pope.On August 9, 1862, the vanguards of "Stonewall" Jackson's army and
of Pope's intercepting forces met at Cedar Mountain.Banks, with the
Second Corps of the Federal army, about eight thousand strong, attacked
Jackson's forces of some sixteen thousand.The charge was so furious that
Jackson's left flank was broken and rolled up, the rear of the center
fired upon, and the whole line thereby thrown into confusion.Banks,
however, received no reenforcements, while Jackson received strong
support.The Federal troops were driven back across the ground which they
had swept clear earlier in the afternoon.[Illustration]

previous evening.After an artillery fire that filled half the afternoon,
the advanced Federal cavalry was pressed back on the infantry supporting
the batteries.Banks underestimated the strength of the Confederates.Instead of sending to Pope for reenforcements, he ordered a charge on the
approaching troops.The Confederates, still feeling their way, were
unprepared for this movement and were thrown into confusion.But at the
moment when the Federal charge was about to end in success, three brigades
of A. P. Hill in reserve were called up.They forced the Federals to
retrace their steps to the point where the fighting began.Here the
Federal retreat, in turn, was halted by General Pope with reenforcements.The Confederates moving up their batteries, a short-range artillery fight
was kept up until midnight.At daylight it was found that Ewell and
Jackson had fallen back two miles farther up the mountain.Pope advanced
to the former Confederate ground and rested, after burying the dead.The
following morning the Confederates had disappeared.The loss to both
armies was almost three thousand in killed, wounded and missing.[Illustration: COPYRIGHT BY PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: SURVIVORS OF THE FIGHTING TENTH

    The battle was indeed one of which General Lee had good reason to be
    proud.It would be hard to find a better instance of that masterly
    comprehension of the actual condition of things which marks a great
    general than was exhibited in General Lee's allowing our formidable
    attack, in which more than half the Federal army was taking part, to
    be fully developed and to burst upon the exhausted troops of Stonewall
    Jackson, while Lee, relying upon the ability of that able soldier to
    maintain his position, was maturing and arranging for the great attack
    on our left flank by the powerful corps of Longstreet.--_John C.
    Ropes, in "The Army Under Pope."_


The battle of Cedar Mountain was but a prelude to the far greater one that
was to take place three weeks later on the banks of the little stream that
had given its name, the year before, to the first important battle of the
war; and here again the result to be registered was similar to that of the
preceding year--a result that brought dismay to the people of the North
and exultation to the adherents of the Southern cause.The three
intervening weeks between the battles of Cedar Mountain and the Second
Bull Run were spent in sparring, in marshaling the armed hosts, in heavy
skirmishing and getting position for a final decisive struggle.The respective heroes
were J. E. B. Stuart, the daring Southern cavalry leader, and "Stonewall"
Jackson.Before relating these
incidents, however, we must take a general view of the field.General
Pope's headquarters at this moment were at Culpeper, with a large part of
his army, but he had left much of his personal baggage and many of his
private papers at Catlett's, a station on the Orange and Alexandria
Railroad between Culpeper and Manassas Junction, while his vast store of
army supplies was at the latter place.Pope's great source of uncertainty lay in the fact that he did not know
whether Lee would move against him or would follow McClellan in the
latter's retreat from the Peninsula; nor did he know when the
reenforcements promised from McClellan's army would reach him.Meanwhile
Lee had decided to let McClellan depart in peace and to advance against
Pope, with the whole Confederate army.To this end Longstreet was ordered
to the scene and with his corps he reached Gordonsville on August 13th.A few days later the two Confederate generals, Lee and Longstreet,
ascended to the top of Clark's Mountain, from which, through powerful
field-glasses, they obtained a good view of Culpeper, about twelve miles
away.They saw that Pope's position was weak and determined to attack him
without delay.Lee ordered his army to cross the Rapidan.He also sent a
courier to gallop across the country with an important dispatch to General
Stuart, disclosing his plans.It was now that General Pope met fortune; he
captured the courier and learned of Lee's plans.Pope knew that he was not
in position to meet Lee's army at Culpeper, and he withdrew from that
place and took up a strong position behind the Rappahannock.Lee had
strained every nerve to get at his antagonist before the latter left
Culpeper and before he could be reenforced by McClellan's army.But sudden
rains changed the Rappahannock from a placid stream into a rushing
torrent.The Confederates were delayed and meantime the reenforcements
from the Peninsula began to reach Pope's army.General Reno with a part of
Burnside's corps was on the ground by August 14th.One week later came
Generals Kearny and Reynolds--both splendid leaders, both destined to give
their lives for their country within a year--to join the Army of Virginia
with some thousands of additional fighters from the Army of the Potomac.Lee was completely thwarted in his purpose of attacking Pope before his
reenforcements arrived.He sent the dauntless cavalry
leader, J. E. B. Stuart, to make a raid around the Union army.Stuart did
this effectively, and this was the first of the two notable events of
these weeks of sparring.Crossing the Rappahannock at Waterloo Bridge with
fifteen hundred mounted men as bold and dauntless as himself, Stuart
dashed up the country, riding all day and all night.After the coming of
night on the evening of the 22d, in the midst of a torrential rainstorm,
while the darkness was so intense that every man was guided by the tread
of his brother horsemen, Stuart pounced upon the Federals near Catlett's
Station, overpowered the astonished guard, captured nearly two hundred
prisoners, scattering the remainder of the troops stationed there far and
wide in the darkness, and seized Pope's despatch-book with his plans and
private papers.Stuart took also several hundred fine horses and burned a
large number of wagons laden with supplies.Among his trophies was a fine
uniform cloak and hat which were the personal property of General Pope.These were exchanged on the following day for General Stuart's plumed hat
which a few days before had been left behind by that officer when
surprised by Federal troops.Stuart's bold raid proved a serious misfortune for the Union army.But Lee
had far greater things in store.His next move was to send Jackson to
Pope's rear with a large part of the Confederate army.Stealthily Jackson
led his army westward, shielded by the woods, the thickets, and the low
hills of the Blue Ridge.It was a quiet rural community through which he
passed.The great majority of the simple country folk had never seen an
army, though it is true that for many days the far-away boom of cannon had
reached their ears from the valley of the Rapidan.Now here was a real
army at their very doors.Nor was it a hostile army, for their sympathies
were Southern.With baskets and armfuls of bread and pies and cakes they
cheered as best they could the tattered and hungry men on the march.General Lee in the meantime had kept Longstreet in front of Pope's army on
the Rappahannock to make daily demonstrations and feints and thus to
divert Pope's attention from Jackson's movements and lead him to believe
that he was to be attacked in front."Stonewall" Jackson suddenly, on August 26th, emerged from the Bull Run
Mountains by way of the Thoroughfare Gap and marshaled his clans on the
plains of Manassas, but a few miles from the site of the famous battle of
the year before.He was astonished to find Jackson in his rear, and
he had to decide instantly between two courses to abandon his
communications with Fredericksburg on the one hand, or with Alexandria and
Washington on the other.He decided to keep in touch with Washington at
all hazards.Breaking his camp on the Rappahannock, he hastened with all
speed to lead his forces toward Manassas Junction, where he had stored
vast quantities of provisions and munitions of war.But he was too late to
save them.Jackson had been joined by Stuart and his cavalry.On the
evening of the 26th they were still some miles from Manassas and Trimble
was sent ahead to make sure the capture before Pope's army could arrive.Through the darkness rode these same hardy men who had a few nights before
made their bold raid on Catlett's Station.The
spoils of this capture were great, including three hundred prisoners, one
hundred and seventy-five horses, ten locomotives, seven long trains of
provisions, and vast stores and munitions of war.Next morning the weary and hungry foot soldiers of Jackson's army came
upon the scene and whatever else they did they feasted as only hungry men
can.An eye-witness wrote, "To see a starving man eating lobster-salad
and drinking Rhine wine, barefooted and in tatters, was curious; the
whole thing was incredible."The amazement at the North when the news of the capture of Manassas became
known cannot be described.But the newspapers belittled it, declaring that
it was merely a bold raid and that for any large force to get between
Pope's army and Washington before Pope became aware of the attempt was
simply impossible.But his position was precarious,
nevertheless.Pope was moving toward him with a far larger army, recently
augmented by Heintzelman's corps from the Army of the Potomac, while Fitz
John Porter with an additional force was not far off.It is true that
Longstreet was hastening to the aid of Jackson, but he had to come by the
same route which had brought Jackson--through Thoroughfare Gap--and Pope
thought he saw a great opportunity.If he could only detain Longstreet at
the gap, why should he not crush Jackson with his superior numbers?To
this end he sent orders to Porter, to McDowell, and to Kearny and others
whose forces were scattered about the country, to concentrate during the
night of the 27th and move upon Jackson.McDowell sent Ricketts with a
small force--too small to prevent Longstreet from passing through
Thoroughfare Gap, and hastened to join the main army against Jackson.But
that able commander was not to be caught in a trap.He moved from Manassas
Junction by three roads toward the old battle-field of Bull Run and by
noon on the 28th the whole corps was once more united between Centreville
and Sudley Spring.Late in the day he encountered King's division of
McDowell's corps near the village of Groveton, and a sharp fight was
opened and kept up till an hour after dark.The Confederates were left in
possession of the field.The following day, August 29th, was the first of the two days' battle,
leaving out of account the fight of the evening before and the desultory
fighting of the preceding ten days.General Pope was still hopeful of
crushing Jackson before the arrival of Longstreet, and on the morning of
the 29th he ordered a general advance across Bull Run.As the noon hour
approached a wild shout that arose from Jackson's men told too well of the
arrival of Longstreet.Far away on the hills near Gainesville could be
seen the marching columns of Longstreet, who had passed through the gap in
safety and who was now rushing to the support of Jackson.The Confederate
army was at last to be reunited.Pope had
lost his opportunity of fighting the army of his opponent in sections.The field was almost the same that the opposing forces had occupied a year
and a month before when the first great battle of the war was fought.And
many of them were the same men.Some who had engaged in that first
conflict had gone home and had refused to reenlist; others had found
soldiers' graves since then--but still others on both sides were here
again, no longer the raw recruits that they were before, but, with their
year of hard experience in the field, they were trained soldiers, equal to
any in the world.The two armies faced each other in a line nearly five miles long.There
was heavy fighting here and there along the line from the early morning
hours, but no general engagement until late in the afternoon.The Union
right pressed hard against the Confederate left and by ten o'clock had
forced it back more than a mile.But the Confederates, presently
reenforced in that quarter, hurled heavy masses of infantry against the
Union right and regained much that it had lost.Late in the afternoon
fresh regiments under Kearny and Hooker charged the Confederate left,
which was swept back and rolled in upon the center.But presently the
Southern General Hood, with his famous Texan brigade, rushed forward in a
wild, irresistible dash, pressed Kearny back, captured one gun, several
flags and a hundred prisoners.Night then closed over the scene and the
two armies rested on their arms until the morning.The first day's battle is sometimes called the battle of Groveton, but
usually it is considered as the first half of the second battle of Bull
Run.The Union loss was at least
forty-five hundred men, the Confederate was somewhat larger.Over the gory
field lay multitudes of men, the blue and the gray commingled, who would
dream of battlefields no more.The living men lay down among the dead in
order to snatch a little rest and strength that they might renew the
strife in the morning.It is a strange fact that Lee and Pope each believed that the other would
withdraw his army during the night, and each was surprised in the morning
to find his opponent still on the ground, ready, waiting, defiant.It was
quite certain that on this day, August 30th, there would be a decisive
action and that one of the two armies would be victor and the other
defeated.The two opposing commanders had called in their outlying
battalions and the armies now faced each other in almost full force, the
Confederates with over fifty thousand men and the Union forces exceeding
their opponents by probably fifteen thousand men.The Confederate left
wing was commanded by Jackson, and the right by Longstreet.The extreme
left of the Union army was under Fitz John Porter, who, owing to a
misunderstanding of orders, had not reached the field the day before.The
center was commanded by Heintzelman and the right by Reno.In the early hours of the morning the hills echoed with the firing of
artillery, with which the day was opened.Porter made an infantry attack
in the forenoon, but was met by the enemy in vastly superior numbers and
was soon pressed back in great confusion.As the hours passed one fearful
attack followed another, each side in turn pressing forward and again
receding.In the afternoon a large part of the Union army made a
desperate onslaught on the Confederate left under Jackson.Here for some
time the slaughter of men was fearful.Jackson saw
that his lines were wavering.He called for reenforcements which did not
come and it seemed as if the Federals were about to win a signal victory.Far away on a little hill at the Confederate right
Longstreet placed four batteries in such a position that he could enfilade
the Federal columns.Quickly he trained his cannon on the Federal lines
that were hammering away at Jackson, and opened fire.Ghastly gaps were
soon cut in the Federal ranks and they fell back.But they re-formed and
came again and still again, each time only to be mercilessly cut down by
Longstreet's artillery.At length Longstreet's whole line rushed forward,
and with the coming of darkness, the whole Union front began to waver.General Lee, seeing this, ordered the Confederates in all parts of the
field to advance.It was now dark
and there was little more fighting; but Lee captured several thousand
prisoners.Pope retreated across Bull Run with the remnant of his army and
by morning was ensconced behind the field-works at Centreville.There was no mistaking the fact that General Pope had lost the battle and
the campaign.He decided to lead his army back to the entrenchments of
Washington.After spending a day behind the embankments at Centreville,
the retreat was begun.Lee's troops with Jackson in the advance pursued
and struck a portion of the retreating army at Chantilly.It was late in the afternoon of September 1st.The rain, accompanied by
vivid lightning and terrific crashes of thunder, was falling in torrents
as Stuart's horsemen, sent in advance, were driven back by the Federal
infantry.Jackson now pushed two of A. P. Hill's brigades forward to
ascertain the condition of the Union army.General Reno was protecting
Pope's right flank, and he lost no time in proceeding against Hill.The
latter was promptly checked, and both forces took position for battle.One side and then the other fell back in turn as lines were re-formed and
urged forward.Night fell and the tempest's fury increased.The ammunition
of both armies was so wet that much of it could not be used.Try as they
would the Confederates were unable to break the Union line and the two
armies finally withdrew.The Confederates suffered a loss of five hundred
men in their unsuccessful attempt to demoralize Pope in his retreat, and
the Federals more than a thousand, including Generals Stevens and Kearny.General Kearny might have been saved but for his reckless bravery.He was
rounding up the retreat of his men in the darkness of the night when he
chanced to come within the Confederate lines.Called on to surrender, he
lay flat on his horse's back, sank his spurs into its sides, and attempted
to escape.Half a dozen muskets were leveled and fired at the fleeing
general.Within thirty yards he rolled from his horse's back dead.The consternation in Washington and throughout the North when Pope's
defeated army reached Arlington Heights can better be imagined than
described.General Pope, who bore the brunt of public indignation, begged
to be relieved of the command.The President complied with his wishes and
the disorganized remnants of the Army of Virginia and the Army of the
Potomac were handed to the "Little Napoleon" of Peninsula fame, George B.
McClellan.The South was overjoyed with its victory--twice it had unfurled its banner
in triumph on the battlefield at Manassas by the remarkable strategy of
its generals and the courage of its warriors on the firing-line.Twice it
had stood literally on the road that led to the capital of the Republic,
only by some strange destiny of war to fail to enter its precincts on the
wave of victory.[Illustration: THE UNHEEDED WARNING

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Here we see Catlett's Station, on the Orange & Alexandria Railroad, which
Stuart's cavalry seized in a night sortie on August 22, 1862.Stuart was unable to burn the loaded wagon-trains
surrounding the station and had to content himself with capturing horses,
which he mounted with wounded Federal soldiers; he escaped at four the
next morning, driven off by the approach of a superior force.Pope, at the
time, was in possession of the fords of the Rappahannock, trying to check
the Confederate advance toward the Shenandoah.Stuart's raid, however, so
alarmed General Halleck that he immediately telegraphed Pope from
Washington: "By no means expose your railroad communication with
Alexandria.It is of the utmost importance in sending your supplies and
reinforcements."Pope did not fall back upon his railroad communication,
however, until after Jackson had seized Manassas Junction.[Illustration: CATLETT'S STATION]

At Manassas Junction, as it appeared in the upper picture on August 26,
1862, is one of the great neglected strategic points in the theater of the
war.Twenty-five miles from Alexandria and thirty miles in a direct line
from Washington, it was almost within long cannon-shot from any point in
both the luckless battles of Bull Run.It was on the railway route
connecting with Richmond, and at the junction of the railway running
across the entrance to the Shenandoah Valley and beyond the Blue Ridge,
through Manassas Gap.The Confederates knew its value, and after the first
battle of Bull Run built the fortifications which we see in the upper
picture, to the left beyond the supply-cars on the railroad.Pope, after
the battle of Cedar Mountain, should have covered it, extending his lines
so as to protect it from Jackson's incursion through Thoroughfare Gap;
instead he held the main force of his army opposing that of Lee.[Illustration: WHERE THE THUNDERBOLT FELL

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The havoc wrought by the Confederate attack of August 26th on the Federal
supply depot at Manassas Junction is here graphically preserved.When
Jackson arrived at sunset of that day at Bristoe's Station, on the Orange
& Alexandria Railroad, he knew that his daring movement would be reported
to Pope's forces by the trains that escaped both north and south.To save
themselves, the troops that had already marched twenty-five miles had to
make still further exertions.Trimble volunteered to move on Manassas
Junction; and, under command of Stuart, a small force moved northward
through the woods.At midnight it arrived within half a mile of the
Junction.The Federal force greeted it with artillery fire, but when the
Confederates charged at the sound of the bugle the gunners abandoned the
batteries to the assaulters.Some three hundred of the small Federal
garrison were captured, with the immense stores that filled the warehouses
to overflowing.The next morning Hill's and Taliaferro's divisions arrived
to hold the position.The half-starved troops were now in possession of
all that was needed to make them an effective force.Jackson was now in
position to control the movements of the Federal army under Pope.[Illustration: GUARDING THE "O.NEAR UNION MILLS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]This is part of the result of General Pope's too rapid advance to head off
Lee's army south of the Rappahannock River.Although overtaking the
advance of the Confederates at Cedar Mountain, Pope had arrived too late
to close the river passes against them.Meanwhile he had left the Orange &
Alexandria Railroad uncovered, and Jackson pushed a large force under
General Ewell forward across the Bull Run Mountains.On the night of
August 26, 1863, Ewell's forces captured Manassas Junction, while four
miles above the Confederate cavalry fell upon an empty railroad train
returning from the transfer of Federal troops.Here we see how well the work was done.THE TRAIN "STONEWALL" JACKSON AND STUART STOPPED AT BRISTOE

[Illustration]

By a move of unparalleled boldness, "Stonewall" Jackson, with twenty
thousand men, captured the immense Union supplies at Manassas Junction,
August 26, 1862.Washington lay one day's
march to the north; Warrenton, Pope's headquarters, but twelve miles
distant to the southwest; and along the Rappahannock, between "Stonewall"
Jackson and Lee, stood the tents of another host which outnumbered the
whole Confederate army."Stonewall" Jackson had seized Bristoe Station in
order to break down the railway bridge over Broad Run, and to proceed at
his leisure with the destruction of the stores.A train returning empty
from Warrenton Junction to Alexandria darted through the station under
heavy fire.Two trains which followed in
the same direction as the first went crashing down a high embankment.The
report received at Alexandria from the train which escaped ran as follows:
"No.6 train, engine Secretary, was fired into at Bristoe by a party of
cavalry some five hundred strong.They had piled ties on the track, but
the engine threw them off.It
was a full day before the Federals realized that "Stonewall" Jackson was
really there with a large force.Here, in abundance, was all that had been
absent for some time; besides commissary stores of all sorts, there were
two trains loaded with new clothing, to say nothing of sutler's stores,
replete with "extras" not enumerated in the regulations, and also the camp
of a cavalry regiment which had vacated in favor of Jackson's men.It was
an interesting sight to see the hungry, travel-worn men attacking this
profusion and rewarding themselves for all their fatigues and deprivations
of the preceding few days, and their enjoyment of it and of the day's rest
allowed them.There was a great deal of difficulty for a time in finding
what each man needed most, but this was overcome through a crude barter of
belongings as the day wore on.[Illustration]


[Illustration: A START TOO LONG DELAYED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Where the troops of General McClellan, waiting near the round-house at
Alexandria, were hurried forward to the scene of action where Pope was
struggling with Jackson and Ewell.Pope had counted upon the assistance of
these reenforcements in making the forward movement by which he expected
to hold Lee back.The old bogey of leaving the National Capital
defenseless set up a vacillation in General Halleck's mind and the troops
were held overlong at Alexandria.Had they been promptly forwarded,
"Stonewall" Jackson's blow at Manassas Junction could not have been
struck.At the news of that disaster the troops were hurriedly despatched
down the railroad toward Manassas.But Pope was already in retreat in
three columns toward that point, McDowell had failed to intercept the
Confederate reenforcements coming through Thoroughfare Gap, and the
situation had become critical.General Taylor, with his brigade of New
Jersey troops, was the first of McClellan's forces to be moved forward to
the aid of Pope.At Union Mills, Colonel Scammon, commanding the First
Brigade, driven back from Manassas Junction, was further pressed by the
Confederates on the morning of August 27th.Later in the day General
Taylor's brigade arrived by the Fairfax road and, crossing the railroad
bridge, met the Confederates drawn up and waiting near Manassas Station.A
severe artillery fire greeted the Federals as they emerged from the woods.As General Taylor had no artillery, he was obliged either to retire or
charge.When the Confederate cavalry threatened to
surround his small force, however, Taylor fell back in good order across
the bridge, where two Ohio regiments assisted in holding the Confederates
in check.At this point, General Taylor, who had been wounded in the
retreat, was borne past in a litter.Though suffering much, he appealed to
the officers to prevent another Bull Run.The brigade retired in good
order to Fairfax Court House, where General Taylor died of his wounds a
short time afterward.[Illustration: BRIGADIER-GENERAL GEORGE W. TAYLOR]


[Illustration: AN UNREALIZED OPPORTUNITY]

Here might have been won a Federal victory that would have precluded
defeat at Second Bull Run.The corps of General Heintzelman, consisting of
the divisions of Hooker and Kearny, was the next detachment of McClellan's
forces to arrive to the aid of Pope.On the 28th of August, Heintzelman
had pushed forward to Centreville, entering it soon after "Stonewall"
Jackson's rear-guard had retired.Instead of pursuing, Heintzelman drew up
his forces east of Cub Run, which we see in the picture.Jackson's forces,
now in a precarious position, fell back toward Thoroughfare Gap to form a
junction with Longstreet's Corps, which Lee had sent forward.The battle
was commenced on the west somewhat feebly by Generals McDowell and Sigel.By nightfall the Confederate left had been driven back fully a mile.[Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL SAMUEL P. HEINTZELMAN AND STAFF

Sleeping on their arms on the night of August 29th, the Federal veterans
were as confident of having won a victory as were the raw troops in the
beginning of the first battle of Bull Run.But the next day's fighting was
to tell the tale.General Ewell had been wounded in the knee by a minie
ball in the severe fight at Groveton and was unable to lead his command;
but for the impetuosity of this commander was substituted that of
Longstreet, nicknamed "the War-Horse," whose arrival in the midst of the
previous day's engagement had cost the Federals dear.On the morning of
the second day Longstreet's batteries opened the engagement.When the
general advance came, as the sun shone on the parallel lines of glittering
bayonets, it was Longstreet's men bringing their muskets to "the ready"
who first opened fire with a long flash of flame.It was they who pressed
most eagerly forward and, in the face of the Federal batteries, fell upon
the troops of General McDowell at the left and drove them irresistibly
back.Although the right Federal wing, in command of General Heintzelman,
had not given an inch, it was this turning of the left by Longstreet which
put the whole Federal army in retreat, driving them across Bull Run.The
Confederates were left in possession of the field, where lay thousands of
Federal dead and wounded, and Lee was free to advance his victorious
troops into the North unmolested.[Illustration: THE BATTLE-FIELD OF SECOND BULL RUN (MANASSAS), AUGUST

Confederates in the West.Succeeding Fremont in November, 1861, Halleck,
importuned by both Grant and Foote, authorized the joint expedition into
Tennessee, and after its successful outcome he telegraphed to Washington:
"Make Buell, Grant, and Pope major-generals of volunteers and give me
command in the West.I ask this in return for Donelson and Henry."He was
chosen to be General-in-Chief of the Federal Armies at the crisis created
by the failure of McClellan's Peninsula Campaign.Halleck held this
position from July 11, 1862, until Grant, who had succeeded him in the
West, finally superseded him at Washington.[Illustration: AT ANTIETAM._Painted by E. Jahn._

ANTIETAM, OR SHARPSBURG

    At Sharpsburg (Antietam) was sprung the keystone of the arch upon
    which the Confederate cause rested.--_James Longstreet,
    Lieutenant-General C. S. A., in "Battles and Leaders of the Civil
    War."_


A battle remarkable in its actualities but more wonderful in its
possibilities was that of Antietam, with the preceding capture of Harper's
Ferry and the other interesting events that marked the invasion of
Maryland by General Lee.It was one of the bloodiest and the most
picturesque conflicts of the Civil War, and while it was not all that the
North was demanding and not all that many military critics think it might
have been, it enabled President Lincoln to feel that he could with some
assurance issue, as he did, his Emancipation Proclamation.Lee's army, fifty thousand strong, had crossed the Potomac at Leesburg and
had concentrated around Frederick, the scene of the Barbara Frietchie
legend, only forty miles from Washington.When it became known that Lee,
elated by his victory at Second Bull Run, had taken the daring step of
advancing into Maryland, and now threatened the capital of the Republic,
McClellan, commanding the Army of the Potomac, pushed his forces forward
to encounter the invaders.Harper's Ferry, at the junction of the Potomac
and the Shenandoah rivers, was a valuable defense against invasion through
the Valley of Virginia, but once the Confederates had crossed it, a
veritable trap.General Halleck ordered it held and General Lee sent
"Stonewall" Jackson to take it, by attacking the fortress on the Virginia
side.Jackson began his march on September 10th with secret instructions from
his commander to encompass and capture the Federal garrison and the vast
store of war material at this place, made famous a few years before by old
John Brown.To conceal his purpose from the inhabitants he inquired along
the route about the roads leading into Pennsylvania.It was from his march
through Frederick that the Barbara Frietchie story took its rise.But
there is every reason to believe that General Jackson never saw the good
old lady, that the story is a myth, and that Mr.Whittier, who has given
us the popular poem under the title of her name, was misinformed.However,
Colonel H. K. Douglas, who was a member of Jackson's staff, relates, in
"Battles and Leaders of the Civil War," an interesting incident where his
commander on entering Middletown was greeted by two young girls waving a
Union flag.The general bowed to the young women, raised his hat, and
remarked to some of his officers, "We evidently have no friends in this
town."Colonel Douglas concludes, "This is about the way he would have
treated Barbara Frietchie."On the day after Jackson left Frederick he crossed the Potomac by means of
a ford near Williamsport and on the 13th he reached Bolivar Heights.Harper's Ferry lies in a deep basin formed by Maryland Heights on the
north bank of the Potomac, Loudon Heights on the south bank, and Bolivar
Heights on the west.The Shenandoah River breaks through the pass between
Loudon and Bolivar Heights and the village lies between the two at the
apex formed by the junction of the two rivers.As Jackson approached the place by way of Bolivar Heights, Walker occupied
Loudon Heights and McLaws invested Maryland Heights.All were unopposed
except McLaws, who encountered Colonel Ford with a force to dispute his
ascent.Ford, however, after some resistance, spiked his guns and retired
to the Ferry, where Colonel Miles had remained with the greater portion of
the Federal troops.Had Miles led his entire force to Maryland Heights he
could no doubt have held his ground until McClellan came to his relief.But General Halleck had ordered him to hold Harper's Ferry to the last,
and Miles interpreted this order to mean that he must hold the town
itself.He therefore failed to occupy the heights around it in sufficient
strength and thus permitted himself to be caught in a trap.During the day of the 14th the Confederate artillery was dragged up the
mountain sides, and in the afternoon a heavy fire was opened on the doomed
Federal garrison.On that day McClellan received word from Miles that the
latter could hold out for two days longer and the commanding general sent
word: "Hold out to the last extremity.If it is possible, reoccupy the
Maryland Heights with your entire force.If you can do that I will
certainly be able to relieve you.... Hold out to the last."McClellan was
approaching slowly and felt confident he could relieve the place.On the morning of the 15th the roar of Confederate artillery again
resounded from hill to hill.From Loudon to Maryland Heights the firing
had begun and a little later the battle-flags of A. P. Hill rose on
Bolivar Heights.Scarcely two hours had the firing continued when Colonel
Miles raised the white flag at Harper's Ferry and its garrison of 12,500,
with vast military stores, passed into the hands of the Confederates.Colonel Miles was struck by a stray fragment of a Confederate shell which
gave him a mortal wound.The force of General Franklin, preparing to move
to the garrison's relief, on the morning of the 15th noted that firing at
the Ferry had ceased and suspected that the garrison had surrendered, as
it had.The Confederate Colonel Douglas, whose account of the surrender is both
absorbing and authoritative, thus describes the surrender in "Battles and
Leaders of the Civil War":

"Under instructions from General Jackson, I rode up the pike and into the
enemy's lines to ascertain the purpose of the white flag.Near the top of
the hill I met General White and staff and told him my mission.He replied
that Colonel Miles had been mortally wounded, that he was in command and
desired to have an interview with General Jackson.... I conducted them to
General Jackson, whom I found sitting on his horse where I had left
him.... The contrast in appearances there presented was striking.General
White, riding a handsome black horse, was carefully dressed and had on
untarnished gloves, boots, and sword.His staff were equally comely in
costume.On the other hand, General Jackson was the dingiest,
worst-dressed and worst-mounted general that a warrior who cared for good
looks and style would wish to surrender to."General Jackson... rode up to Bolivar and down into Harper's Ferry.The
curiosity in the Union army to see him was so great that the soldiers
lined the sides of the road.... One man had an echo of response all about
him when he said aloud: 'Boys, he's not much for looks, but if we'd had
him we wouldn't have been caught in this trap.'"McClellan had failed to reach Harper's Ferry in time to relieve it because
he was detained at South Mountain by a considerable portion of Lee's army
under D. H. Hill and Longstreet.McClellan had come into possession of
Lee's general order, outlining the campaign.Discovering by this order
that Lee had sent Jackson to attack Harper's Ferry he made every effort to
relieve it.The affair at Harper's Ferry, as that at South Mountain, was but a prelude
to the tremendous battle that was to follow two days later on the banks of
the little stream called Antietam Creek, in Maryland.When it was known
that Lee had led his army across the Potomac the people were filled with
consternation--the people, not only of the immediate vicinity, but of
Harrisburg, of Baltimore, of Philadelphia.Their fear was intensified by
the memory of the Second Bull Run of a few weeks earlier, and by the fact
that at this very time General Bragg was marching northward across
Kentucky with a great army, menacing Louisville and Cincinnati.As one year before, the hopes of the North had centered in George B.
McClellan, so it was now with the people of the East.They were ready to
forget his failure to capture Richmond in the early summer and to contrast
his partial successes on the Peninsula with the drastic defeat of his
successor at the Second Bull Run.When McClellan, therefore, passed through Maryland to the scene of the
coming battle, many of the people received him with joy and enthusiasm.At
Frederick City, he tells us in his "Own Story," he was "nearly overwhelmed
and pulled to pieces," and the people invited him into their houses and
gave him every demonstration of confidence.The first encounter, a double one, took place on September 14th, at two
passes of South Mountain, a continuation of the Blue Ridge, north of the
Potomac.General Franklin, who had been sent to relieve Harper's Ferry,
met a Confederate force at Crampton's Gap and defeated it in a sharp
battle of three hours' duration.Meanwhile, the First and Ninth Army
Corps, under Burnside, encountered a stronger force at Turner's Gap seven
miles farther up.The battle here continued many hours, till late in the
night, and the Union troops were victorious.Lee's loss was nearly twenty-seven hundred, of whom eight hundred were
prisoners.The Federals lost twenty-one hundred men and they failed to
save Harper's Ferry.Lee now placed Longstreet and D. H. Hill in a strong position near
Keedysville, but learning that McClellan was advancing rapidly, the
Confederate leader decided to retire to Sharpsburg, where he could be more
easily joined by Jackson.September 16th was a day of intense anxiety and
unrest in the valley of the Antietam.The people who had lived in the
farmhouses that dotted the golden autumn landscape in this hitherto quiet
community had now abandoned their homes and given place to the armed
forces.It was a day of marshaling and maneuvering of the gathering
thousands, preparatory to the mighty conflict that was clearly seen to be
inevitable.Lee had taken a strong position on the west bank of Antietam
Creek a few miles from where it flows into the Potomac.He made a display
of force, exposing his men to the fire of the Federal artillery, his
object being to await the coming of Jackson's command from Harper's Ferry.It is true that Jackson himself had arrived, but his men were weary with
marching and, moreover, a large portion of his troops under A. P. Hill and
McLaws had not yet reached the field.McClellan spent the day arranging his corps and giving directions for
planting batteries.With a few companions he rode along the whole front,
frequently drawing the fire of the Confederate batteries and thus
revealing their location.The right wing of his army, the corps of
Generals Hooker, Mansfield, and Sumner, lay to the north, near the village
of Keedysville.General Porter with two divisions of the Fifth Corps
occupied the center and Burnside was on the left of the Union lines.Back
of McClellan's lines was a ridge on which was a signal station commanding
a view of the entire field.Late on the afternoon of the 16th, Hooker
crossing the Antietam, advanced against Hood's division on the Confederate
left.For several hours there was heavy skirmishing, which closed with the
coming of darkness.The two great armies now lay facing each other in a grand double line
three miles in length.At one point (the Union right and the Confederate
left) they were so near together that the pickets could hear each other's
tread.It required no prophet to foretell what would happen on the morrow.Beautiful and clear the morning broke over the Maryland hills on the
fateful 17th of September, 1862.The sunlight had not yet crowned the
hilltops when artillery fire announced the opening of the battle.Hooker's
infantry soon entered into the action and encountered the Confederates in
an open field, from which the latter were presently pressed back across
the Hagerstown pike to a line of woods where they made a determined stand.Hooker then called on General Mansfield to come to his aid, and the latter
quickly did so, for he had led his corps across the Antietam after dark
the night before.Mansfield, however, a gallant and honored veteran, fell
mortally wounded while deploying his troops, and General Alpheus S.
Williams, at the head of his first division, succeeded to the command.There was a wood west of the Sharpsburg and Hagerstown turnpike which,
with its outcropping ledges of rock, formed an excellent retreat for the
Confederates and from this they pushed their columns into the open fields,
chiefly of corn, to meet the Union attacks.For about two hours the battle
raged at this point, the lines swaying to and fro, with fearful slaughter
on both sides.At length, General Greene, who commanded a division of the
fallen Mansfield's corps, gained possession of part of the coveted forest,
near a little white church, known as the Dunker's Chapel.This was on high
ground and was the key to the Confederate left wing.But Greene's troops
were exposed to a galling fire from D. H. Hill's division and he called
for reenforcements.General Sumner then sent Sedgwick's division across the stream and
accompanied the troops to the aid of their hard-pressed comrades.And the
experience of this body of the gallant Second Corps during the next hour
was probably the most thrilling episode of the whole day's battle.Sedgwick's troops advanced straight toward the conflict.They found Hooker
wounded and his and Williams' troops quite exhausted.A sharp artillery
fire was turned on Sedgwick before he reached the woods west of the
Hagerstown pike, but once in the shelter of the thick trees he passed in
safety to the western edge.Heavy Confederate reenforcements--ten brigades, in fact--Walker's men, and
McLaws', having arrived from Harper's Ferry--were hastening up, and they
not only blocked the front, but worked around to the rear of Sedgwick's
isolated brigades.Sedgwick was wounded in the awful slaughter that
followed, but he and Sumner finally extricated their men with a loss of
two thousand, over three hundred left dead on the ghastly field.Franklin
now sent forward some fresh troops and after obstinately fighting, the
Federals finally held a cornfield and most of the coveted wood over which
the conflict had raged till the ground was saturated with blood.Before the close of this bloody conflict on the Union right another,
almost if not quite as deadly, was in progress near the center.General
French, soon joined by General Richardson, both of Sumner's corps, crossed
the stream and made a desperate assault against the Southerners of D. H.
Hill's division, stationed to the south of where the battle had previously
raged--French on a line of heights strongly held by the Confederates,
Richardson in the direction of a sunken road, since known as "Bloody
Lane."The fighting here was of a most desperate character and continued
nearly four hours.French captured a few flags, several hundred prisoners,
and gained some ground, but he failed to carry the heights.Richardson was
mortally wounded while leading a charge and was succeeded by General
Hancock; but his men finally captured Bloody Lane with the three hundred
living men who had remained to defend it.The final Federal charge at this
point was made by Colonel Barlow, who displayed the utmost bravery and
self-possession in the thickest of the fight, where he won a
brigadier-generalship.He was wounded, and later carried off the field.The Confederates had fought desperately to hold their position in Bloody
Lane, and when it was captured it was filled with dead bodies.It was now
about one o'clock and the infantry firing ceased for the day on the Union
right, and center.Let us now look on the other part of the field.Burnside held the Federal
left wing against Lee's right, and he remained inactive for some hours
after the battle had begun at the other end of the line.In front of
Burnside was a triple-arched stone bridge across the Antietam, since known
as "Burnside's Bridge."Opposite this bridge, on the <DW72> which extends
to a high ridge, were Confederate breastworks and rifle-pits, which
commanded the bridge with a direct or enfilading fire.While the Federal
right was fighting on the morning of the 17th, McClellan sent an order to
Burnside to advance on the bridge, to take possession of it and cross the
stream by means of it.It must have been about ten o'clock when Burnside
received the order as McClellan was more than two miles away.Burnside's chief officer at this moment was General Jacob D. Cox
(afterward Governor of Ohio), who had succeeded General Reno, killed at
South Mountain.On Cox fell the task of capturing the stone bridge.The
defense of the bridge was in the hands of General Robert Toombs, a former
United States senator and a member of Jefferson Davis' Cabinet.Perhaps
the most notable single event in the life of General Toombs was his
holding of the Burnside Bridge at Antietam for three hours against the
assaults of the Federal troops.The Confederates had been weakened at this
point by the sending of Walker to the support of Jackson, where, as we
have noticed, he took part in the deadly assault upon Sedgwick's division.Toombs, therefore, with his one brigade had a heavy task before him in
defending the bridge with his small force, notwithstanding his advantage
of position.McClellan sent several urgent orders to advance at all hazards.Burnside
forwarded these to Cox, and in the fear that the latter would be unable to
carry the bridge by a direct front attack, he sent Rodman with a division
to cross the creek by a ford some distance below.Meanwhile, in rapid succession, one assault after
another was made upon the bridge and, about one o'clock, it was carried,
at the cost of five hundred men.A lull in the
fighting along the whole line of battle now ensued.Burnside, however, received another order from McClellan to push on up the
heights and to the village of Sharpsburg.The great importance of this
move, if successful, was that it would cut Lee out from his line of
retreat by way of Shepherdstown.After replenishing the ammunition and adding some fresh troops, Cox
advanced at three o'clock with the utmost gallantry toward Sharpsburg.The
Confederates disputed the ground with great bravery.But Cox swept all
before him and was at the edge of the village when he was suddenly
confronted by lines in blue uniforms who instantly opened fire.The
Federals were astonished to see the blue-clad battalions before them.They
must be Union soldiers; but how did they get there?They were A. P. Hill's division of Lee's army which had just
arrived from Harper's Ferry, and they had dressed themselves in the
uniforms that they had taken from the Federal stores.Hill had come just in time to save Lee's headquarters from capture.He
checked Cox's advance, threw a portion of the troops into great confusion,
and steadily pressed them back toward the Antietam.In this, the end of
the battle, General Rodman fell mortally wounded.Cox retired in good
order and Sharpsburg remained in the hands of the Confederates.Thus, with the approach of nightfall, closed the memorable battle of
Antietam.For fourteen long hours more than one hundred thousand men, with
five hundred pieces of artillery, had engaged in titanic combat.As the
pall of battle smoke rose and cleared away, the scene presented was one to
make the stoutest heart shudder.There lay upon the ground, scattered for
three miles over the valleys and the hills or in the improvised hospitals,
more than twenty thousand men.Horace Greeley was probably right in
pronouncing this the bloodiest day in American history.Although tactically it was a drawn battle, Antietam was decisively in
favor of the North inasmuch as it ended the first Confederate attempt at a
Northern invasion.General Lee realized that his ulterior plans had been
thwarted by this engagement and after a consultation with his corps
commanders he determined to withdraw from Maryland.On the night of the
18th the retreat began and early the next morning the Confederate army had
all safely recrossed the Potomac.The great mistake of the Maryland campaign from the standpoint of the
Confederate forces, thought General Longstreet, was the division of Lee's
army, and he believed that if Lee had kept his forces together he would
not have been forced to abandon the campaign.At Antietam, he had less
than forty thousand men, who were in poor condition for battle while
McClellan had about eighty-seven thousand, most of whom were fresh and
strong, though not more than sixty thousand were in action.The moral effect of the battle of Antietam was incalculably great.It
aroused the confidence of the Northern people.It emboldened President
Lincoln to issue five days after its close the proclamation freeing the
slaves in the seceded states.He had written the proclamation long before,
but it had lain inactive in his desk at Washington.All through the
struggles of the summer of 1862 he had looked forward to the time when he
could announce his decision to the people.With the doubtful success of Federal arms, to make such a bold step would
have been a mockery and would have defeated the very end he sought.The South had now struck its first desperate blow at the gateways to the
North.By daring, almost unparalleled in warfare, it had swung its
courageous army into a strategical position where with the stroke of
fortune it might have hammered down the defenses of the National capital
on the south and then sweep on a march of invasion into the North.The
Northern soldiers had parried the blow.They had saved themselves from
disaster and had held back the tide of the Confederacy as it beat against
the Mason and Dixon line, forcing it back into the State of Virginia where
the two mighty fighting bodies were soon to meet again in a desperate
struggle for the right-of-way at Fredericksburg.[Illustration: JEFFERSON DAVIS

ACCORDING TO HIS WIDOW THE ONLY WAR-TIME PHOTOGRAPH OF THE PRESIDENT OF
THE CONFEDERACY

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Thus appeared Jefferson Davis, who on the eve of Antietam was facing one
of the gravest crises of his career.Eighteen months previously, on
February 9, 1861, he had been unanimously elected president of the
Confederate States of America.He maintained
that the secession of the Southern states should be regarded as a purely
peaceful move.But events had swiftly drawn him and his government into
the most stupendous civil conflict of modern times.Now, in September,
1862, he was awaiting the decision of fate.The Southern forces had
advanced northward triumphantly.Elated by success, they were at this
moment invading the territory of the enemy under the leadership of Lee,
whose victories had everywhere inspired not only confidence but enthusiasm
and devotion.Should he overthrow the Northern armies, the Confederacy
would be recognized abroad and its independence probably established at
home.Should he be defeated, no one could foretell the result.From this time the fortunes of the Confederacy waned.[Illustration: LEE LOCKS THE GATES

COPYRIGHT 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Sharpsburg, Maryland, September 17, 1862.There were long minutes on that
sunny day in the early fall of 1862 when Robert E. Lee, at his
headquarters west of Sharpsburg, must have been in almost entire ignorance
of how the battle went.Outnumbered he knew his troops were; outfought he
knew they never would be.Longstreet, Hood, D. H. Hill, Evans, and D. R.
Jones had turned back more than one charge in the morning; but, as the day
wore on, Lee perceived that the center must be held.He had deceived McClellan as to his numerical strength and he must
continue to do so.At one time
General Longstreet reported from the center to General Chilton, Lee's
Chief of Staff, that Cooke's North Carolina regiment--still keeping its
colors at the front--had not a cartridge left.None but veteran troops
could hold a line like this, supported by only two guns of Miller's
battery of the Washington Artillery.Of this crisis in the battle General
Longstreet wrote afterward: "We were already badly whipped and were
holding our ground by sheer force of desperation."Actually in line that
day on the Confederate side were only 37,000 men, and opposed to them were
numbers that could be footed up to 50,000 more.At what time in the day
General Lee must have perceived that the invasion of Maryland must come to
an end cannot be told.He had lost 20,000 of his tired, footsore army by
straggling on the march, according to the report of Longstreet, who adds:
"Nearly one-fourth of the troops who went into the battle were killed or
wounded."At dark Lee's rearward movement had begun.[Illustration: A REGIMENT THAT FOUGHT AT SOUTH MOUNTAIN--THE THIRTY-FIFTH

A HERO OF SEDGWICK'S CHARGE]

Early in the morning of September 17, 1862, Knap's battery (shown below)
got into the thick of the action of Antietam.General Mansfield had posted
it opposite the north end of the West Woods, close to the Confederate
line.The guns opened fire at seven o'clock.Practically unsupported, the
battery was twice charged upon during the morning; but quickly
substituting canister for shot and shell, the men held their ground and
stemmed the Confederate advance.Near this spot General Mansfield was
mortally wounded while deploying his troops.About noon a section of
Knap's battery was detached to the assistance of General Greene, in the
East Woods.[Illustration: KNAP'S BATTERY, JUST AFTER THE BLOODY WORK AT ANTIETAM

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.This photograph was taken back of the rail fence on the Hagerstown pike,
where "Stonewall" Jackson's men attempted to rally in the face of Hooker's
ferocious charge that opened the bloodiest day of the Civil War--September
17, 1862.Hooker, advancing to seize high ground nearly three-quarters of
a mile distant, had not gone far before the glint of the rising sun
disclosed the bayonet-points of a large Confederate force standing in a
cornfield in his immediate front.This was a part of Jackson's Corps which
had arrived during the morning of the 16th from the capture of Harper's
Ferry and had been posted in this position to surprise Hooker in his
advance.The outcome was a terrible surprise to the Confederates.All of
Hooker's batteries hurried into action and opened with canister on the
cornfield.The Confederates stood bravely up against this fire, and as
Hooker's men advanced they made a determined resistance.Back and still
farther back were Jackson's men driven across the open field, every stalk
of corn in which was cut down by the battle as closely as a knife could
have done it.On the ground the slain lay in rows precisely as they had
stood in ranks.From the cornfield into a small patch of woods (the West
Woods) the Confederates were driven, leaving the sad result of the
surprise behind them.As the edge of the woods was approached by Hooker's
men the resistance became stronger and more stubborn.Nearly all the units
of two of Jackson's divisions were now in action, and cavalry and
artillery were aiding them."The two lines," says General Palfrey, "almost
tore each other to pieces."General Starke and Colonel Douglas on the
Confederate side were killed.More than half of Lawton's and Hays'
brigades were either killed or wounded.On the Federal side General
Ricketts lost a third of his division.The energy of both forces was
entirely spent and reinforcements were necessary before the battle could
be continued.Many of Jackson's men wore trousers and caps of Federal
blue, as did most of the troops which had been engaged with Jackson in the
affair at Harper's Ferry.A. P. Hill's men, arriving from Harper's Ferry
that same afternoon, were dressed in new Federal uniforms--a part of their
booty--and at first were mistaken for Federals by the friends who were
anxiously awaiting them.[Illustration: THE THRICE-FOUGHT GROUND

Confederate dead.Over this open space swept Sedgwick's division of
Sumner's Second Corps, after passing through the East and entering the
West Woods.This is near where the Confederate General Ewell's division,
reenforced by McLaws and Walker, fell upon Sedgwick's left flank and rear.Nearly two thousand Federal soldiers were struck down, the division losing
during the day more than forty per cent.One
regiment lost sixty per cent.--the highest regimental loss sustained.Later the right of the Confederate line crossed the turnpike at the Dunker
church (about half a mile to the left of the picture) and made two
assaults upon Greene, but they were repulsed with great slaughter.General
D. R. Jones, of Jackson's division, had been wounded.The brave Starke who
succeeded him was killed; and Lawton, who followed Starke, had fallen
wounded.[Illustration: RUIN OF MUMMA'S HOUSE, ANTIETAM]

A flaming mansion was the guidon for the extreme left of Greene's division
when (early in the morning) he had moved forward along the ridge leading
to the East Woods.This dwelling belonged to a planter by the name of
Mumma.It stood in the very center of the Federal advance, and also at the
extreme left of D. H. Hill's line.The house had been fired by the
Confederates, who feared that its thick walls might become a vantage-point
for the Federal infantry.It burned throughout the battle, the flames
subsiding only in the afternoon.Before it, just across the road, a
battery of the First Rhode Island Light Artillery had placed its guns.Twice were they charged, but each time they were repulsed.From Mumma's
house it was less than half a mile across the open field to the Dunker
church.The fence-rails in the upper picture were those of the field
enclosing Mumma's land, and the heroic dead pictured lying there were in
full sight from the burning mansion.[Illustration: THE HARVEST OF "BLOODY LANE"

blow of which the Federals could boast in the day's fighting at Antietam,
September 17, 1862.In the lower picture we see the officers whose work
first began to turn the tide of battle into a decisive advantage which the
Army of the Potomac had every reason to expect would be gained by its
superior numbers.On the Federal right Jackson, with a bare four thousand
men, had taken the fight out of Hooker's eighteen thousand in the morning,
giving ground at last to Sumner's fresh troops.On the Federal left,
Burnside (at the lower bridge) failed to advance against Longstreet's
Corps, two-thirds of which had been detached for service elsewhere.It was
at the center that the forces of French and Richardson, skilfully fought
by their leaders, broke through the Confederate lines and, sweeping beyond
the sunken road, seized the very citadel of the center.Meagher's Irish
Brigade had fought its way to a crest from which a plunging fire could be
poured upon the Confederates in the sunken road.Meagher's ammunition was
exhausted, and Caldwell threw his force into the position and continued
the terrible combat.When the Confederates executed their flanking
movement to the left, Colonel D. R. Cross, of the Fifth New Hampshire,
seized a position which exposed Hill's men to an enfilading fire.(In the

[Illustration: SHERRICK'S HOUSE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.In three distinct localities the battle waxed fierce from dawn to dusk on
that terrible day at Antietam, September 17, 1862.First at the Federal
right around the Dunker church; then at the sunken road, where the centers
of both armies spent themselves in sanguinary struggle; lastly, late in
the day, the struggle was renewed and ceased on the Sharpsburg road.When
Burnside finally got his troops in motion, Sturgis' division of the Ninth
Corps was first to cross the creek; his men advanced through an open
ravine under a withering fire till they gained the opposite crest and held
it until reenforced by Wilcox.To their right ran the Sharpsburg road, and
an advance was begun in the direction of the Sherrick house.[Illustration: GENERAL A. P. HILL, C. S.The fighting along the Sharpsburg road might have resulted in a
Confederate disaster had it not been for the timely arrival of the troops
of General A. P. Hill.His six brigades of Confederate veterans had been
the last to leave Harper's Ferry, remaining behind Jackson's main body in
order to attend to the details of the surrender.Just as the Federal Ninth
Corps was in the height of its advance, a cloud of dust on Harper's Ferry
road cheered the Confederates to redoubled effort.Out of the dust the
brigades of Hill debouched upon the field.Their fighting blood seemed to
have but mounted more strongly during their march of eighteen miles.Without waiting for orders, Hill threw his men into the fight and the
progress of the Ninth Corps was stopped.Lee had counted on the arrival of
Hill in time to prevent any successful attempt upon the Confederate right
held by Longstreet's Corps, two-thirds of which had been detached in the
thick of the fighting of the morning, when Lee's left and center suffered
so severely.Burnside's delay at the bridge could not have been more
fortunate for Lee if he had fixed its duration himself.Had the
Confederate left been attacked at the time appointed, the outcome of
Antietam could scarcely have been other than a decisive victory for the
Federals.Even at the time when Burnside's tardy advance began, it must
have prevailed against the weakened and wearied Confederates had not the
fresh troops of A. P. Hill averted the disaster.[Illustration: AFTER THE ADVANCE]

In the advance along the Sharpsburg road near the Sherrick house the 79th
New York "Highlanders" deployed as skirmishers.From orchards and
cornfields and from behind fences and haystacks the Confederate
sharpshooters opened upon them, but they swept on, driving in a part of
Jones' division and capturing a battery just before A. P. Hill's troops
arrived.With these reenforcements the Confederates drove back the brave
Highlanders from the suburbs of Sharpsburg, which they had reached.Stubborn Scotch blood would permit only a reluctant retreat.Sharp
fighting occurred around the Sherrick house with results seen in the lower
picture.[Illustration: THE SEVENTEENTH NEW YORK ARTILLERY DRILLING BEFORE THE

Army of the Potomac, as he had done at Harrison's Landing.Puzzled to
understand how Lee could have circumvented a superior force on the

    As it is, the battle of Stone's River seems less clearly a Federal
    victory than the battle of Shiloh.The latter decided the fall of
    Corinth; the former did not decide the fall of Chattanooga.Offensively it was a drawn battle, as looked at from either side.As a
    defensive battle, however, it was clearly a Union victory.--_John
    Fiske in "The Mississippi Valley in the Civil War."_


The battle of Corinth developed a man--William S. Rosecrans--whose
singular skill in planning the battle, and whose dauntless courage in
riding between the firing-lines at the opportune moment, drew the
country's attention almost as fully as Grant had done at Fort Donelson.And at this particular moment the West needed, or thought it needed, a
man.The autumn months of 1862 had been spent by Generals Bragg and Buell
in an exciting race across Kentucky, each at the head of a great army.Buell had saved Louisville from the legions of Bragg, and he had driven
the Confederate Army of the Mississippi from the State; but he had not
prevented his opponent from carrying away a vast amount of plunder, nor
had he won decisive results at the battle of Perryville, which took place
October 8, 1862, four days after the battle of Corinth.Thereupon the
Federal authorities decided to relieve Buell of the Army of the Ohio and
to give it to General Rosecrans.On October 30, 1862, Rosecrans assumed command at Nashville of this force,
which was now designated as the Army of the Cumberland.Bragg had
concentrated his army at Murfreesboro, in central Tennessee, about thirty
miles southeast of Nashville and a mile east of a little tributary of the
Cumberland River called Stone's River.Here occurred, two months later,
the bloodiest single day's battle in the West, a conflict imminent as
soon as the news came (on December 26th) that the Federals were advancing
from Nashville.General Bragg did not lose a moment in marshaling his army into well-drawn
battle-lines.His army was in two corps with a cavalry division under
General Wheeler, Forrest and Morgan being on detached service.The left
wing, under General Hardee, and the center, under Polk, were sent across
Stone's River, the right wing, a division under John C. Breckinridge,
remaining on the eastern side of the stream to guard the town.The line
was three miles in length, and on December 30th the Federal host that had
come from Nashville stood opposite, in a parallel line.The left wing, opposite Breckinridge, was commanded by
Thomas L. Crittenden, whose brother was a commander in the Confederacy.They were sons of the famous United States senator from Kentucky, John J.
Crittenden.The Federal center, opposite Polk, was commanded by George H.
Thomas, and the right wing, opposing the Confederate left, was led by
Alexander McD.McCook, one of the well-known "Fighting McCook" brothers.The effective Federal force was about forty-three thousand men; the
Confederate army numbered about thirty-eight thousand.That night they
bivouacked within musket range of each other and the camp-fires of each
were clearly seen by the other as they shone through the cedar groves that
interposed.Thus lay the two great armies, ready to spring upon each other
in deadly combat with the coming of the morning.Rosecrans had permitted McCook to thin out his lines over too much space,
while on that very part of the field Bragg had concentrated his forces for
the heaviest attack.The plans of battle made by the two opposing
commanders were strikingly similar.Rosecrans' plan was to throw his left
wing, under Crittenden, across the river upon the Confederate right under
Breckinridge, to crush it in one impetuous dash, and to swing around
through Murfreesboro to the Franklin road and cut off the Confederate
line of retreat.Bragg, on the other hand, intended to make a similar dash
upon the Union right, pivot upon his center, press back McCook upon that
center, crumpling the Federals and seizing the Nashville turnpike to cut
off Rosecrans' retreat toward Nashville.Neither, of course, knew of the
other's plan, and much would depend on who would strike first.At the early light of the last day of the year the Confederate left wing
moved upon the Union right in a magnificent battle-line, three-quarters of
a mile in length and two columns deep.At the same time the Confederate
artillery opened with their cannon.McCook was astonished at so fierce and
sudden a charge.The gallant Patrick Cleburne, one of the ablest
commanders in the Southern armies, led his division, which had been
brought from the Confederate right, in the charge.The Federal lines were
ill prepared for this sudden onslaught, and before McCook could arrange
them several batteries were overpowered and eleven of the heavy guns were
in the hands of the Confederates.Slowly the Union troops fell back, firing as they went; but they had no
power to check the impetuous, overwhelming charge of the onrushing foe.McCook's two right divisions, under Johnson and Jeff.C. Davis, were
driven back, but his third division, which was commanded by a young
officer who had attracted unusual attention at the battle of
Perryville--Philip H. Sheridan--held its ground.At the first Confederate
advance, Sill's brigade of Sheridan's division drove the troops in front
of it back into their entrenchments, and in the charge the brave Sill lost
his life.While the battle raged with tremendous fury on the Union right, Rosecrans
was three miles away, throwing his left across the river.Hearing the
terrific roar of battle at the other end of the line, Rosecrans hastened
to begin his attack on Breckinridge hoping to draw a portion of the
Confederate force away from McCook.But as the hours of the forenoon
passed he was dismayed as he noted that the sound of battle was coming
nearer, and he rightly divined that his right wing was receding before the
dashing soldiers of the South.He ordered McCook to dispute every inch of
the ground; but McCook's command was soon torn to pieces and disorganized,
except the division of Sheridan.The latter stood firm against the overwhelming numbers, a stand that
attracted the attention of the country and brought him military fame.He
checked the onrushing Confederates at the point of the bayonet; he formed
a new line under fire.In his first position Sheridan held his ground for
two hours.The Confederate attack had also fallen heavily on Negley, who
was stationed on Sheridan's left, and on Palmer, both of Thomas' center.Rousseau commanding the reserves, and Van Cleve of Crittenden's forces
were ordered to the support of the Union center and right.Here, for two
hours longer the battle raged with unabated fury, and the slaughter of
brave men on both sides was appalling.Three times the whole Confederate
left and center were thrown against the Union divisions, but failed to
break the lines.At length when their cartridge boxes were empty
Sheridan's men could do nothing but retire for more ammunition, and they
did this in good order to a rolling plain near the Nashville road.But
Rousseau of Thomas' center was there to check the Confederate advance.It was now past noon, and still the battle roar resounded unceasingly
through the woods and hills about Murfreesboro.Though both hosts had
struggled and suffered since early morning, they still held to their guns,
pouring withering volleys into each other's ranks.The Federal right and
center had been forced back at right angles to the position they had held
when day dawned; and the Confederate left was swung around at right angles
to its position of the morning.The Federal left rested on Stone's River,
while Bragg's right was on the same stream and close to the line in blue.Meantime, Rosecrans had massed his artillery on a little hill overlooking
the field of action.He had also re-formed the broken lines of the right
and center and called in twelve thousand fresh troops.Then, after a brief
lull, the battle opened again and the ranks of both sides were torn with
grape and canister and bursting shells.In answer to Bragg's call for reenforcements came Breckinridge with all
but one brigade of his division, a host of about seven thousand fresh
troops.The new Confederate attack began slowly, but increased its speed
at every step.Suddenly, a thundering volley burst from the line in blue,
and the front ranks of the attacking column disappeared.Again, a volley
tore through the ranks in gray, and the assault was abandoned.The battle had raged for nearly eleven hours, when night enveloped the
scene, and the firing abated slowly and died away.It had been a bloody
day--this first day's fight at Stone's River--and except at Antietam it
had not thus far been surpassed in the war.The advantage was clearly with
the Confederates.They had pressed back the Federals for two miles, had
routed their right wing and captured many prisoners and twenty-eight heavy
guns.But Rosecrans determined to hold his ground and try again.The next day was New Year's and but for a stray fusillade, here and there,
both armies remained inactive, except that each quietly prepared to renew
the contest on the morrow.The renewal of the battle on January 2nd was
fully expected on both sides, but there was little fighting till four in
the afternoon.Rosecrans had sent General Van Cleve's division on January
1st across the river to seize an elevation from which he could shell the
town of Murfreesboro.Bragg now sent Breckinridge to dislodge the
division, and he did so with splendid effect.But Breckinridge's men came
into such a position as to be exposed to the raking fire of fifty-two
pieces of Federal artillery on the west side of the river.Returning the
deadly and constant fire as best they could, they stood the storm of shot
and shell for half an hour when they retreated to a place of safety,
leaving seventeen hundred of their number dead or wounded on the field.That night the two armies again lay within musket shot of each other.The
next day brought no further conflict and during that night General Bragg
moved away to winter quarters at Shelbyville, on the Elk River.Murfreesboro, or Stone's River, was one of the great battles of the war.The losses were about thirteen thousand to the Federals and over ten
thousand to the Confederates.Both sides claimed victory--the South
because of Bragg's signal success on the first day; the North because of
Breckinridge's fearful repulse at the final onset and of Bragg's
retreating in the night and refusing to fight again.A portion of the
Confederate army occupied Shelbyville, Tennessee, and the larger part
entrenched at Tullahoma, eighteen miles to the southeast.Six months after the battle of Stone's River, the Federal army suddenly
awoke from its somnolent condition--a winter and spring spent in raids and
unimportant skirmishes--and became very busy preparing for a long and
hasty march.Rosecrans' plan of campaign was brilliant and proved most
effective.He realized that Tullahoma was the barrier to Chattanooga, and
determined to drive the Confederates from it.On June 23, 1863, the advance began.The cavalry, under General Stanley,
had received orders to advance upon Shelbyville on the 24th, and during
that night to build immense and numerous camp-fires before the Confederate
stronghold at Shelbyville, to create the impression that Rosecrans' entire
army was massing at that point.But the wily leader of the Federals had
other plans, and when Stanley, supported by General Granger, had built his
fires, the larger force was closing in upon Tullahoma.The stratagem dawned upon Bragg too late to check Rosecrans' plans.Stanley and Granger made a brilliant capture of Shelbyville, and Bragg
retired to Tullahoma; but finding here that every disposition had been
made to fall upon his rear, he continued his southward retreat toward
Chattanooga.[Illustration: MEN WHO LEARNED WAR WITH SHERMAN

so that they could never be used again.The wrecking of a railroad might
postpone a maneuver for months, or might terminate a campaign suddenly in
defeat.Each side in retreat burned its bridges and destroyed the railroad
behind it.Again advancing, each had to pause for the weary work of
repair.[Illustration: SKIRMISHERS AT CHANCELLORSVILLE._Painted by J. W. Gies._

FREDERICKSBURG--DISASTER FOR A NEW UNION LEADER

    The Army of the Potomac had fought gallantly; it had not lost a single
    cannon, all its attacks being made by masses of infantry; it had
    experienced neither disorder nor rout.But the defeat was complete,
    and its effects were felt throughout the entire country as keenly as
    in the ranks of the army.The little confidence that Burnside had been
    able to inspire in his soldiers had vanished, and the respect which
    everybody entertained for the noble character of the unfortunate
    general could not supply its place.--_Comte de Paris, in "History of
    the Civil War in America."_


The silent city of military graves at Fredericksburg is a memorial of one
of the bloodiest battles of the Civil War.The battle of Antietam had been
regarded a victory by the Federals and a source of hope to the North,
after a wearisome period of inaction and defeats.General George B.
McClellan, in command of the Army of the Potomac, failed to follow up this
advantage and strike fast and hard while the Southern army was shattered
and weak.President Lincoln's impatience was brought to a climax;
McClellan was relieved and succeeded by General Ambrose E. Burnside, who
was looked upon with favor by the President, and who had twice declined
this proffered honor.It was on November 5, 1862, nearly two months after
Antietam, when this order was issued.The Army of the Potomac was in
splendid form and had made plans for a vigorous campaign.On the 9th
Burnside assumed command, and on the following day McClellan took leave of
his beloved troops.Burnside at once changed the whole plan of campaign, and decided to move
on Fredericksburg, which lay between the Union and Confederate armies.He
organized his army into three grand divisions, under Generals Sumner,
Hooker, and Franklin, commanding the right, center, and left, and moved
his troops from Warrenton to Falmouth.A delay of some two weeks was due
to the failure of arrival of the pontoons.In a council of war held on the
night of December 10th the officers under Burnside expressed themselves
almost unanimously as opposed to the plan of battle, but Burnside
disregarded their views and determined to carry out his original plans
immediately.After some delay and desultory fighting for two days, the
crossing of the army was effected by the morning of December 13th.By this
time General Robert E. Lee, commanding the Confederates, had his army
concentrated and entrenched on the hills surrounding the town.In their
efforts to place their bridges the Federals were seriously hindered by the
firing of the Confederate sharpshooters--"hornets that were stinging the
Army of the Potomac into a frenzy."The Confederate fire continued until
silenced by a heavy bombardment of the city from the Federal guns, when
the crossing of the army into Fredericksburg was completed without further
interference.The forces of Lee were in battle array about the town.Their line
stretched for five miles along the range of hills which spread in crescent
shape around the lowland where the city lay, surrounding it on all sides
save the east, where the river flowed.The strongest Confederate position
was on the <DW72>s of the lowest hill of the range, Marye's Heights, which
rose in the rear of the town.Along the foot of this hill there was a
stone wall, about four feet in height, bounding the eastern side of the
Telegraph road, which at this point runs north and south, being depressed
a few feet below the surface of the stone wall, thus forming a breastwork
for the Confederate troops.Behind it a strong force was concealed, while
higher up, in several ranks, the main army was massed, stretching along
the line of hills.The right wing, consisting of thirty thousand troops on
an elevation near Hamilton's Crossing of the Fredericksburg and Potomac
Railroad, was commanded by "Stonewall" Jackson.The left, on Marye's
Heights and Marye's Hill, was commanded by the redoubtable Longstreet.The
Southern forces numbered about seventy-eight thousand.Into the little city below and the adjoining valleys, the Federal troops
had been marching for two days.Franklin's Left Grand Division of forty
thousand was strengthened by two divisions from Hooker's Center Grand
Division, and was ordered to make the first attack on the Confederate
right under Jackson.Sumner's Right Grand Division, also reenforced from
Hooker's forces, was formed for assault against the Confederate's
strongest point at Marye's Hill.All this magnificent and portentous battle formation had been effected
under cover of a dense fog, and when it lifted on that fateful Saturday
there was revealed a scene of truly military grandeur.Concealed by the
somber curtain of nature the Southern hosts had fixed their batteries and
entrenched themselves most advantageously upon the hills, and the Union
legions, massed in menacing strength below, now lay within easy
cannon-shot of their foe.The Union army totaled one hundred and thirteen
thousand men.After skirmishing and gathering of strength, it was at
length ready for the final spring and the death-grapple.When the sun's rays broke through the fog during the forenoon of December
13th, Franklin's Grand Division was revealed in full strength in front of
the Confederate right, marching and countermarching in preparation for the
coming conflict.Officers in new, bright uniforms, thousands of bayonets
gleaming in the sunshine, champing steeds, rattling gun-carriages whisking
artillery into proper range of the foe, infantry, cavalry, batteries, with
officers and men, formed a scene of magnificent grandeur which excited the
admiration even of the Confederates.This maneuver has been called the
grandest military scene of the war.Yet with all this brave show, we have seen that Burnside's subordinate
officers were unanimous in their belief in the rashness of the
undertaking.The English military writer,
Colonel Henderson, has explained why this was so:

    And yet that vast array, so formidable of aspect, lacked that moral
    force without which physical power, even in its most terrible form, is
    but an idle show.Not only were the strength of the Confederate
    position, the want of energy of preliminary movements, the insecurity
    of their own situation, but too apparent to the intelligence of the
    regimental officers and men, but they mistrusted their commander.Northern writers have recorded that the Army of the Potomac never went
    down to battle with less alacrity than on this day at Fredericksburg.The first advance began at 8:30 in the morning, while the fog was still
dense, upon Jackson's right.Reynolds ordered Meade with a division,
supported by two other divisions under Doubleday and Gibbon, to attack
Jackson at his weakest point, the extreme right of the Confederate lines,
and endeavor to seize one of the opposing heights.The advance was made in
three lines of battle, which were guarded in front and on each flank by
artillery which swept the field in front as the army advanced.The
Confederates were placed to have an enfilading sweep from both flanks
along the entire front line of march.When Reynolds' divisions had
approached within range, Jackson's small arms on the left poured in a
deadly fire, mowing down the brave men in the Union lines in swaths,
leaving broad gaps where men had stood.This fire was repeated again and again, as the Federals pressed on, only
to be repulsed.Once only was the Confederate line broken, when Meade
carried the crest, capturing flags and prisoners.The ground lost by the
Confederates was soon recovered, and the Federals were forced to retire.Some of the charges made by the Federals during this engagement were
heroic in the extreme, only equaled by the opposition met from the foe.In one advance, knapsacks were unslung and bayonets fixed; a brigade
marched across a plowed field, and passed through broken lines of other
brigades, which were retiring to the rear in confusion from the leaden
storm.The fire became incessant and destructive; many fell, killed or wounded;
the front line slackened its pace, and without orders commenced firing.A
halt seemed imminent, and a halt in the face of the terrific fire to which
the men were exposed meant death; but, urged on by regimental commanders
in person, the charge was renewed, when with a shout they leaped the
ditches, charged across the railroad, and upon the foe, killing many with
the bayonet and capturing several hundred prisoners.But this was only a
temporary gain.In every instance the Federals were shattered and driven
back.Men were lying dead in heaps, the wounded and dying were groaning in
agony.Soldiers were fleeing; officers were galloping to and fro urging
their lines forward, and begging their superior officers for assistance
and reenforcement.A dispatch to Burnside from Franklin, dated 2:45, was as follows: "My left
has been very badly handled; what hope is there of getting reenforcements
across the river?"Another dispatch, dated 3:45, read: "Our troops have
gained no ground in the last half hour."In their retreat the fire was almost as destructive as during the assault.Most of the wounded were brought from the field after this engagement, but
the dead were left where they fell.It was during this engagement that
General George D. Bayard was mortally wounded by a shot which had severed
the sword belt of Captain Gibson, leaving him uninjured.The knapsack of a
soldier who was in a stooping posture was struck by a ball, and a deck of
cards was sent flying twenty feet in the air.Those witnessing the
ludicrous scene called to him, "Oh, deal me a hand!"thus indicating the
spirit of levity among soldiers even amid such surroundings.Another
soldier sitting on the ground suddenly leaped high above the heads of his
comrades as a shell struck the spot, scooping a wheelbarrowful of earth,
but the man was untouched.Entirely independent of the action in which the Left Grand Division under
Franklin was engaged against the right wing of the Confederate line,
Sumner's Right Grand Division was engaged in a terrific assault upon the
works on Marye's Heights, the stronghold of the Confederate forces.Their
position was almost impregnable, consisting of earthworks, wood, and stone
barricades running along the sunken road near the foot of Marye's Hill.The Federals were not aware of the sunken road, nor of the force of
twenty-five hundred under General Cobb concealed behind the stone wall,
this wall not being new work as a part of the entrenchments, but of
earlier construction.When the advance up the road was made they were
harassed by shot and shell and rifle-balls at every step, but the men came
dashing into line undismayed by the terrific fire which poured down upon
them.The Irish Brigade, the second of Hancock's division, under General
Meagher, made a wonderful charge.When they returned from the assault but
two hundred and fifty out of twelve hundred men reported under arms from
the field, and all these were needed to care for their wounded comrades.The One Hundred and Sixteenth Pennsylvania regiment was new on the field
of battle, but did fearless and heroic service.The approach was
completely commanded by the Confederate guns.Repeatedly the advance was
repulsed by well-directed fire from the batteries.Once again Sumner's gallant men charged across a railroad cut, running
down one side and up the other, and still again attempted to escape in the
same manner, but each time they were forced to retire precipitately by a
murderous fire from the Confederate batteries.Not only was the
Confederate fire disastrous upon the approach and the successive repulses
by the foe, but it also inflicted great damage upon the masses of the
Federal army in front of Marye's Hill.The Confederates' effective and
successful work on Marye's Hill in this battle was not alone due to the
natural strength of their position, but also to the skill and generalship
of the leaders, and to the gallantry, courage, and well-directed aim of
their cannoneers and infantry.Six times the heroic Union troops dashed against the invulnerable
position, each time to be repulsed with terrific loss.General Couch, who
had command of the Second Corps, viewing the scene of battle from the
steeple of the court-house with General Howard, says: "The whole plain was
covered with men, prostrate and dropping, the live men running here and
there, and in front closing upon each other, and the wounded coming back.I had never before seen fighting like that, nothing approaching it in
terrible uproar and destruction."General Howard reports that Couch exclaimed: "Oh, great God!see how our
men, our poor fellows, are falling!"At half-past one Couch signaled
Burnside: "I am losing.The point and method of attack made by Sumner was anticipated by the
Confederates, careful preparation having been made to meet it.The fire
from the Confederate batteries harassed the Union lines, and as they
advanced steadily, heroically, without hurrah or battle-cry, the ranks
were cut to pieces by canister and shell and musket-balls.Heavy artillery
fire was poured into the Union ranks from front, right, and left with
frightful results.Quickly filling up the decimated ranks they approached
the stone wall masking the death-trap where General Cobb lay with a strong
force awaiting the approach.Torrents of lead poured into the bodies of
the defenseless men, slaying, crushing, destroying the proud army of a few
hours before.As though in pity, a cloud of smoke momentarily shut out the
wretched scene but brought no balm to the helpless victims of this awful
carnage.The ground was so thickly strewn with dead bodies as seriously to
impede the movements of a renewed attack.These repeated assaults in such
good order caused some apprehension on the part of General Lee, who said
to Longstreet after the third attack, "General, they are massing very
heavily and will break your line, I am afraid."But the great general's
fears proved groundless.General Cobb was borne from the field mortally wounded, and Kershaw took
his place in the desperate struggle.The storm of shot and shell which met
the assaults was terrific.Men fell almost in battalions; the dead and
wounded lay in heaps.Late in the day the dead bodies, which had become
frozen from the extreme cold, were stood up in front of the soldiers as a
protection against the awful fire to shield the living, and at night were
set up as dummy sentinels.The steadiness of the Union troops, and the silent, determined heroism of
the rank and file in these repeated, but hopeless, assaults upon the
Confederate works, were marvelous, and amazed even their officers.The
real greatness in a battle is the fearless courage, the brave and heroic
conduct, of the men under withering fire.It was the enlisted men who were
the glory of the army.It was they, the rank and file, who stood in the
front, closed the gaps, and were mowed down in swaths like grass by cannon
and musket-balls.After the sixth disastrous attempt to carry the works of the Confederate
left it was night; the Federal army was repulsed and had retired; hope was
abandoned, and it was seen that the day was lost to the Union side.Then
the shattered Army of the Potomac sought to gather the stragglers and care
for the wounded.Fredericksburg, the beautiful Virginia town, was a
pitiable scene in contrast to its appearance a few days before.Ancestral
homes were turned into barracks and hospitals.The charming drives and
stately groves, the wonted pleasure grounds of Colonial dames and Southern
cavaliers, were not filled with grand carriages and gay parties, but with
war horses, soldiers, and military accouterments.Aside from desultory
firing by squads and skirmishers at intervals there was no renewal of the
conflict.The bloody carnage was over, the plan of Burnside had ended in failure,
and thousands of patriotic and brave men, blindly obedient to their
country's command, were the toll exacted from the Union army.Burnside,
wild with anguish at what he had done, walking the floor of his tent,
exclaimed, "Oh, those men--those men over there," pointing to the
battlefield, "I am thinking of them all the time."In his report of the
battle to Washington, Burnside gave reasons for the issue, and in a manly
way took the responsibility upon himself, and most highly commended his
officers and men.He said, "For the failure in the attack I am
responsible, as the extreme gallantry, courage, and endurance shown by
them [officers and men] were never excelled."President Lincoln's verdict in regard to this battle is adverse to the
almost unanimous opinion of the historians.In his reply, December 22d, to
General Burnside's report of the battle, he says, "Although you were not
successful, the attempt was not an error, nor the failure other than an
accident."Burnside, at his own request, was relieved of the command of
the Army of the Potomac, however, on January 25, 1863, and was succeeded
by General Hooker.The Union loss in killed, wounded, and missing was
12,653, and the Confederates lost 5,377.After the battle the wounded lay on the field in their agony exposed to
the freezing cold for forty-eight hours before arrangements were effected
to care for them.Many were burned to death by the long, dead grass
becoming ignited by cannon fire.The scene witnessed by the army of those
screaming, agonizing, dying comrades was dreadful and heart-rending.Burnside's plan had been to renew the battle, but the overwhelming opinion
of the other officers prevailed.The order was withdrawn and the defeated
Union army slipped away under the cover of darkness on December 15th, and
encamped in safety across the river.The battle of Fredericksburg had
passed into history.[Illustration: THE SECOND LEADER AGAINST RICHMOND

COPYRIGHT 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Major-General Ambrose Everett Burnside was a West Point graduate, inventor
of a breech-loading rifle, commander of a brigade in the first battle of
Bull Run, captor of Roanoke Island and Newberne (North Carolina), and
commander of the Federal left at Antietam.He was appointed to the command
of the Army of the Potomac and succeeded General George B. McClellan on
November 8, 1862.He was a brave soldier, but was an impatient leader and
inclined to be somewhat reckless.He pressed rapidly his advance against
Lee and massed his entire army along Stafford Heights, on the east bank of
the Rappahannock, opposite Fredericksburg.According to General W. B.
Franklin (who commanded the left grand division of the army), the notion
that a serious battle was necessary to Federal control of the town "was
not entertained by any one."General Sumner (who led the advance of
Burnside's army) held this opinion but he had not received orders to cross
the river.Crossing was delayed nearly a month and this delay resulted in
the Federal disaster on December 13th.This put an abrupt end to active
operations by Burnside against Lee.This picture was taken at Warrenton,
November 24th, on the eve of the departure of the army for its march to
Fredericksburg.[Illustration: THE DETAINED GUNS

town had suffered its bombardment in December of the previous year.Again
the armies were separated by the Rappahannock River.There was a new
commander at the head of the Army of the Potomac--General Hooker.The
plundered and deserted town now held by the Confederates was to be made
the objective of another attack.The heights beyond were once more to be
assaulted; bridges were to be rebuilt.This ground
of much contention was deserted some time before Lee advanced to his
invasion of Pennsylvania.Very slowly the inhabitants of Fredericksburg
had returned to their ruined homes.The town was a vast Federal cemetery,
the dead being buried in gardens and backyards, for during its occupancy
almost every dwelling had been turned into a temporary hospital.After the
close of the war these bodies were gathered and a National Cemetery was
established on Willis' Hill, on Marye's Heights, the point successfully
defended by Lee's veterans.Heavy pontoon-boats, each on its separate wagon, were sometimes as
necessary as food or ammunition.At every important crossing of the many
rivers that had to be passed in the Peninsula Campaign the bridges had
been destroyed.There were few places where these streams were fordable.Pontoons, therefore, made a most important adjunct to the Army of the
Potomac.[Illustration: PONTOON-BOATS IN TRANSIT]

scene.On those memorable days of December 11 and 12, 1862, from these
very trenches shown in the foreground, the ragged gray riflemen saw on
that hillside across the river the blue of the uniforms of the massed
Federal troops.The lines of tents made great white spaces, but the ground
could hardly be seen for the host of men who were waiting, alas!to die by
thousands on this coveted shore.From these hills, too, burst an incessant
flaming and roaring cannon fire.Siege-guns and field artillery poured
shot and shell into the town of Fredericksburg.Every house became a
target, though deserted except for a few hardy and venturesome riflemen.Ruined and battered and
bloody, Fredericksburg three times was a Federal hospital, and its
backyards became little cemeteries.[Illustration: A TARGET AT FREDERICKSBURG FOR THE FEDERAL GUNS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]At Franklin Crossing, on the Rappahannock, occurred an incident that
proves how little things may change the whole trend of the best-laid
plans.The left Union wing under the command of General Franklin, composed
of the First Army Corps under General Reynolds, and the Sixth under
General W. F. Smith, was crossing to engage in the battle of
Fredericksburg.For two days they poured across these yielding planks
between the swaying boats to the farther shore.Now, in the crossing of
bridges, moving bodies of men must break step or even well-built
structures might be threatened.The colonel of one of the regiments in
General Devens' division that led the van ordered his field music to
strike up just as the head of the column swept on to the flimsy planking;
before the regiment was half-way across, unconsciously the men had fallen
into step and the whole fabric was swaying to the cadenced feet.Vibrating
like a great fiddle-string, the bridge would have sunk and parted, but a
keen eye had seen the danger.was the order, and a
staff officer spurred his horse through the men, shouting at top voice.The lone charge was made through the marching column: some jumped into the
pontoons to avoid the hoofs; a few went overboard; but the head of the
column was reached at last, and the music stopped.A greater blunder than
this, however, took place on the plains beyond.Owing to a
misunderstanding of orders, 37,000 troops were never brought into action;
17,000 men on their front bore the brunt of a long day's fighting.[Illustration: OFFICERS OF THE FAMOUS "IRISH BRIGADE"

advanced in Hancock's Division to the first assault at Marye's Heights, on
December 13, 1862.In this charge the Irish soldiers moved steadily up the
ridge until within a few yards of a sunken road, from which unexpected
fire mowed them down.Of the 1,315 men which Meagher led into battle, 545
fell in that charge.The officer standing is Colonel Patrick Kelly, of the
Eighty-eighth New York, who was one of the valiant heroes of this charge,
and succeeded to the command of the Irish Brigade after General Meagher.The officer seated is Captain Clooney, of the

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Marye's House marked the center of the Confederate position on the
Heights, before which the Federals fell three deep in one of the bravest
and bloodiest assaults of the war.The eastern boundary of the Marye
estate was a retaining wall, along which ran a sunken road; on the other
side of this was a stone wall, shoulder high, forming a perfect infantry
parapet.Here two brigades of Confederates were posted and on the crest
above them were the supporting batteries, while the <DW72> between was
honeycombed with the rifle-pits of the sharpshooters, one of which is seen
in the picture.Six times did the Federals, raked by the deadly fire of
the Washington Artillery, advance to within a hundred yards of the sunken
road, only to be driven back by the rapid volleys of the Confederate
infantry concealed there.Less than three of every five men in Hancock's
division came back from their charge on these death-dealing heights.The
complete repulse of the day and the terrific slaughter were the barren
results of an heroic effort to obey orders.[Illustration: THE FATEFUL CROSSING

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.From this, the Lacy House, which Sumner had made his headquarters, he
directed the advance of his right grand division of the Army of the
Potomac on December 11, 1862.Little did he dream that his men of the
Second Corps were to bear the brunt of the fighting and the most crushing
blow of the defeat on the 13th.Soon after three o'clock on the morning of
the 11th the columns moved out with alacrity to the river bank and before
daybreak, hidden at first by the fog, the pontoniers began building the
bridges.Confederate sharpshooters drove off the working party from the
bridge below the Lacy House and also from the middle bridge farther down.As the mist cleared, volunteers ferried themselves over in the boats and
drove off the riflemen.At last, at daybreak of the 12th, the town of
Fredericksburg was occupied, but the whole of another foggy day was
consumed in getting the army concentrated on the western shore.Nineteen
batteries (one hundred and four guns) accompanied Sumner's troops, but all
save seven of these were ordered back or left in the streets of
Fredericksburg.Late on the morning of the 13th the confused and belated
orders began to arrive from Burnside's headquarters across the river; one
was for Sumner to assault the Confederate batteries on Marye's Heights.At
nightfall Sumner's men retired into Fredericksburg, leaving 4,800 dead or
wounded on the field."Oh, those men, those men over there!I cannot get
them out of my mind!"wailed Burnside in an agony of failure.Yet he was
planning almost in the same breath to lead in person his old command, the
Ninth Corps, in another futile charge in the morning.On the night of the
14th, better judgment prevailed and the order came to retire across the
Rappahannock.[Illustration: NEW LEADERS AND NEW PLANS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.These were the men whose work it was,
during the winter after Fredericksburg, to restore the _esprit de corps_
of the Army of the Potomac.The tireless energy and magnetic personality
of Hooker soon won officers from their disaffection and put an end to
desertions--which had been going on at the rate of two hundred per day
before he took command.By spring everything seemed propitious for an
aggressive campaign, the plans for which were brilliantly drawn and at
first vigorously carried out, giving truth to Lincoln's expressed belief
that Hooker was "a trained and skilful soldier."In that remarkable letter
of admonition to Hooker upon assuming command, Lincoln added: "But beware
of rashness, beware of rashness; with energy and with sleepless vigilance
go forward and give us victories."By some strange fate it was not
rashness but quite the contrary which compassed the failure of "Fighting
Joe" Hooker at Chancellorsville.His first forward advance was executed
with his usual bold initiative.Before Lee could fully divine his purpose,
Hooker with thirty-six thousand men was across his left flank in a
favorable position, with the main body of his army at hand ready to give
battle.Then came Hooker's inexplicable order to fall back upon
Chancellorsville.That very night, consulting in the abandoned Federal
position, Lee and Jackson formed the plan which drove Hooker back across
the Rappahannock in ignominious defeat.CHANCELLORSVILLE AND JACKSON'S FLANKING MARCH


After the Fredericksburg campaign the Union forces encamped at Falmouth
for the winter, while Lee remained with the Southern army on the site of
his successful contest at Fredericksburg.Thus the two armies lay facing
each other within hailing distance, across the historic river, waiting for
the coming of spring.Major-General Joseph Hooker, popularly known as
"Fighting Joe" Hooker, who had succeeded Burnside in command of the Army
of the Potomac, soon had the troops on a splendid campaign footing.His
force was between 125,000 and 130,000 men; Lee's, about 60,000.Hooker conceived a plan of campaign which was ingenious and masterful, and
had he carried it out there would have been a different story to tell
about Chancellorsville.The plan was to deploy a portion of the army to
serve as a decoy to Lee, while the remainder of the host at the same time
occupied the vicinity of Chancellorsville, a country mansion, in the
center of the wilderness that stretched along the Rappahannock.Lee was a great general and a master in strategy.He had learned of
Hooker's plan and, paying but little attention to Sedgwick east of
Fredericksburg, had turned to face Hooker.By a rapid night march he met
the Union army before it had reached its destination.He was pushed back,
however, by Sykes, of Meade's corps, who occupied the position assigned to
him.Meade was on the left, and Slocum on the right, with adequate support
in the rear.All was in readiness and most favorable for the "certain
destruction" of the Confederates predicted by "Fighting Joe" when, to the
amazement and consternation of all his officers, Hooker ordered the whole
army to retire to the position it had occupied the day before, leaving the
advantage to his opponents.Lee quickly moved his army into the position thus relinquished, and began
feeling the Federal lines with skirmishers and some cannonading during the
evening of May 1st.By the next morning the two armies were in line of
battle.The danger in which the Confederate army now found itself was extreme.One
large Federal army was on its front, while another was at its rear, below
Fredericksburg.But Lee threw the hopes of success into one great and
decisive blow at Hooker's host.Dividing an army in the face of the foe is
extremely dangerous and contrary to all accepted theories of military
strategy; but there comes a time when such a course proves the salvation
of the legions in peril.Such was the case at Chancellorsville on May 2,
1863.the cannonading began its death-song and was soon followed by
infantry demonstrations, but without serious results.Early in the afternoon, Hooker by a ruse was beguiled into the
belief that Lee's army was in full retreat.What Hooker had seen and
believed to be a retreat was the marching of Jackson's forces, about
twenty-six thousand strong, from the battlefield.What he did not see,
however, was that, after a few miles, Jackson turned abruptly and made for
the right flank of the Federal host, the Eleventh Corps, under Howard.It
was after half-past five when Jackson broke from the woods into which he
had marched in a paralyzing charge upon the unprepared troops of Howard.The approach of this Confederate force was first intimated to the Federals
by the bending of shrubbery, the stampede of rabbits and squirrels, and
the flocks of birds in wild flight, as before a storm.Then appeared a few
skirmishers, then a musket volley, and then the storm broke in all its
fury--the war scream, the rattling musketry, the incessant roar of cannon.The knowledge that "Old Jack" was on
the field was inspiration enough for them.The charge was so precipitous,
so unexpected and terrific that it was impossible for the Federals to hold
their lines and stand against the impact of that awful onslaught which
carried everything before it.The regiments in Jackson's path, resisting
his advance, were cut to pieces and swept along as by a tidal wave, rolled
up like a scroll, multitudes of men, horses, mules, and cattle being piled
in an inextricable mass.Characteristic of Jackson's brilliant and
unexpected movements, it was like an electric flash, knocking the Eleventh
Corps into impotence, as Jackson expected it would.This crowning and
final stroke of Jackson's military genius was not impromptu, but the
result of his own carefully worked-out plan, which had been approved by
Lee.General Hooker was spending the late afternoon hours in his headquarters
at the Chancellor house.To the eastward there was considerable firing,
where his men were carrying out the plan of striking Lee in flank.Jackson
was retreating, of that he was sure, and Sickles, with Pleasanton's
cavalry and other reenforcements, was in pursuit.About half-past six the sounds of battle grew suddenly louder
and seemed to come from another direction.A staff-officer went to the
front of the house and turned his field-glass toward the west.At the startled cry Hooker sprang upon his horse and dashed down the road.He encountered portions of the Eleventh Corps pouring out of the forest--a
badly mixed crowd of men, wagons, and ambulances.They brought the news
that the right wing was overwhelmed.Hurriedly Hooker sought his old
command, Berry's division of the Third Corps, stationed in support of the
Eleventh.An officer who witnessed the scene says the division advanced with a firm
and steady step, cleaving the multitude of disbanded Federals as the bow
of a vessel cleaves the waves of the sea.It struck the advance of the
Confederates obliquely and checked it, with the aid of the Twelfth Corps
artillery.A dramatic, though tragic, feature of the rout was the charge of the
Eighth Pennsylvania cavalry, under Major Keenan, in the face of almost
certain death, to save the artillery of the Third Corps from capture.The
guns rested upon low ground and within reach of the Confederates.The
Federals had an equal opportunity to seize the artillery, but required a
few minutes to prepare themselves for action.The Confederate advance must
be checked for these few moments, and for this purpose Keenan gallantly
led his five hundred cavalrymen into the woods, while his comrades brought
the guns to bear upon the columns in gray.He gained the necessary time,
but lost his life at the head of his regiment, together with Captain
Arrowsmith and Adjutant Haddock, who fell by his side.The light of day had faded from the gruesome scene.The mighty turmoil was
silenced as darkness gathered, but the day's carnage was not ended.No
camp-fires were lighted in the woods or on the plain.The two hostile
forces were concealed in the darkness, watching through the shadows,
waiting for--they knew not what.Finally at midnight the order "Forward"
was repeated in subdued tones along the lines of Sickles' corps.Out over
the open and into the deep, dark thicket the men in blue pursued their
stealthy advance upon the Confederate position.Then the tragedies of the
night were like that of the day, and the moon shed her peaceful rays down
upon those shadowy figures as they struggled forward through the woods, in
the ravines, over the hillocks.The Federals, at heavy loss, gained the
position, and the engagement assumed the importance of a victory.It was on this day that death robbed the South of one of her most beloved
warriors.After darkness had overspread the land, Jackson, accompanied by
members of his staff, undertook a reconnaissance of the Federal lines.He came upon a line of Union infantry lying
on its arms and was forced to turn back along the plank road, on both
sides of which he had stationed his own men with orders to fire upon any
body of men approaching from the direction of the Federal battle-lines.The little cavalcade of Confederate officers galloped along the highway,
directly toward the ambuscade, and apparently forgetful of the strict
orders left with the skirmishers.A sudden flash of flame lighted the
scene for an instant, and within that space of time the Confederacy was
deprived of one of its greatest captains.Jackson was severely wounded,
and by his own men and through his own orders.When the news spread
through Jackson's corps and through the Confederate army the grief of the
Southern soldiers was heartbreaking to witness.The sorrow spread even
into the ranks of the Federal army, which, while opposed to the wounded
general on many hard-fought battle-grounds, had learned to respect and
admire "Stonewall" Jackson.Sandra travelled to the bathroom.The loss of Jackson to the South was incalculable.Lee had pronounced him
the right arm of the whole army.Next to Lee, Jackson was considered the
ablest general in the Confederate army.His shrewdness of judgment, his
skill in strategy, his lightning-like strokes, marked him as a unique and
brilliant leader.Devoutly religious, gentle and noble in character, the
nation that was not to be disunited lost a great citizen, as the
Confederate army lost a great captain, when a few days later General
Jackson died.That night orders passed from the Federal headquarters to Sedgwick, below
Fredericksburg, eleven miles away.Between him and Hooker stood the
Confederate army, flushed with its victories of the day.Immediately in
his front was Fredericksburg, with a strong guard of Southern warriors.Beyond loomed Marye's Heights, the battle-ground on which Burnside had in
the preceding winter left so many of his brave men in the vain endeavor to
drive the Confederate defenders from the crest.The courageous Sedgwick, notwithstanding the formidable obstacles that lay
on the road to Chancellorsville, responded immediately to Hooker's order.He was already on the south side of the river, but he was farther away
than Hooker supposed.Shortly after midnight he began a march that was
fraught with peril and death.Strong resistance was offered the advancing
blue columns as they came to the threshold of Fredericksburg, but they
swept on and over the defenders, and at dawn were at the base of the
heights.On the crest waved the standards of the Confederate Washington
Artillery.At the foot of the <DW72> was the stone wall before which the
Federals had fought and died but a few months before, in the battle of
Fredericksburg.Reenforcements were arriving in the Confederate trenches
constantly.The crest and <DW72>s bristled with cannon and muskets.The
pathways around the heights were barricaded.The route to the front seemed
blocked; still, the cry for help from Hooker was resounding in the ears of
Sedgwick.Gathering his troops, he attacked directly upon the stone wall and on up
the hillside, in the face of a terrific storm of artillery and musketry.The first assault failed; a flank movement met with no better success; and
the morning was nearly gone when the Confederates finally gave way at the
point of the bayonet before the irresistible onset of men in blue.The way
to Chancellorsville was open; but the cost to the Federals was appalling.Hundreds of the soldiers in blue lay wrapped in death upon the bloody
<DW72>s of Marye's Heights.It was the middle of the afternoon, and not at daybreak, as Hooker had
directed, when Sedgwick appeared in the rear of Lee's legions.A strong
force of Confederates under Early prevented his further advance toward a
juncture with Hooker's army at Chancellorsville.Since five o'clock in
the morning the battle had been raging at the latter place, and Jackson's
men, now commanded by Stuart, though being mowed down in great numbers,
vigorously pressed the attack of the day while crying out to one another
"Remember Jackson," as they thought of their wounded leader.While this engagement was at its height General Hooker, leaning against a
pillar of the Chancellor house, was felled to the ground, and for a moment
it was thought he was killed.The pillar had been shattered by a
cannon-ball.Hooker soon revived under the doctor's care and with great
force of will he mounted his horse and showed himself to his anxious
troops.He then withdrew his army to a stronger position, well guarded
with artillery.The Confederates did not attempt to assail it.The third
day's struggle at Chancellorsville was finished by noon, except in Lee's
rear, where Sedgwick fought all day, without success, to reach the main
body of Hooker's army.The Federals suffered very serious losses during
this day's contest.Even then it was believed that the advantage rested
with the larger Army of the Potomac and that the Federals had an
opportunity to win.Thirty-seven thousand Union troops, the First, and
three-quarters of the Fifth Corps, had been entirely out of the fight on
that day.Five thousand men of the Eleventh Corps, who were eager to
retrieve their misfortune, were also inactive.When night came, and the shades of darkness hid the sights of suffering on
the battlefield, the Federal army was resting in a huge curve, the left
wing on the Rappahannock and the right on the Rapidan.In this way the
fords across the rivers which led to safety were in control of the Army of
the Potomac.Lee moved his corps close to the bivouacs of the army in
blue.But, behind the Confederate battle-line, there was a new factor in
the struggle in the person of Sedgwick, with the remnants of his gallant
corps, which had numbered nearly twenty-two thousand when they started for
the front, but now were depleted by their terrific charge upon Marye's
Heights and the subsequent hard and desperate struggle with Early in the
afternoon.Lee was between two fires--Hooker in front and Sedgwick in the rear, both
of whose forces were too strong to be attacked simultaneously.Again the
daring leader of the Confederate legions did the unexpected, and divided
his army in the presence of the foe, though he was without the aid of his
great lieutenant, "Stonewall" Jackson.During the night Lee made his preparations, and when dawn appeared in the
eastern skies the movement began.Sedgwick, weak and battered by his
contact with Early on the preceding afternoon, resisted bravely, but to no
avail, and the Confederates closed in upon him on three sides, leaving the
way to Banks's Ford on the Rappahannock open to escape.Slowly the
Federals retreated and, as night descended, rested upon the river bank.After dark the return to the northern side was begun by Sedgwick's men,
and the Chancellorsville campaign was practically ended.The long, deep trenches full of Federal and Confederate dead told the
awful story of Chancellorsville.If we gaze into these trenches, which by
human impulse we are led to do, after the roar and din of the carnage is
still, the scene greeting the eye will never be forgotten.Side by side,
the heroes in torn and bloody uniforms, their only shrouds, were gently
laid.The Union loss in killed and wounded was a little over seventeen thousand,
and it cost the South thirteen thousand men to gain this victory on the
banks of the Rappahannock.The loss to both armies in officers was very
heavy.The two armies were weary and more than decimated.It appeared that both
were glad at the prospect of a cessation of hostilities.On the night of
May 5th, in a severe storm, Hooker conveyed his corps safely across the
river and settled the men again in their cantonments of the preceding
winter at Falmouth.The Confederates returned to their old encampment at
Fredericksburg.[Illustration: A MAN OF WHOM MUCH WAS EXPECTED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]A daring and experienced veteran of the Mexican
War, Hooker had risen in the Civil War from brigade commander to be the
commander of a grand division of the Army of the Potomac, and had never
been found wanting.His advancement to the head of the Army of the
Potomac, on January 26, 1863, was a tragic episode in his own career and
in that of the Federal arms.Gloom hung heavy over the North after
Fredericksburg.Upon Hooker fell the difficult task of redeeming the
unfulfilled political pledges for a speedy lifting of that gloom.It was
his fortune only to deepen it.[Illustration: "STONEWALL" JACKSON--TWO WEEKS BEFORE HIS MORTAL WOUND

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The austere, determined features of the victor of Chancellorsville, just
as they appeared two weeks before the tragic shot that cost the
Confederacy its greatest Lieutenant-General--and, in the opinion of sound
historians, its chief hope for independence.Only once had a war
photograph of Jackson been taken up to April, 1863, when, just before the
movement toward Chancellorsville, he was persuaded to enter a
photographer's tent at Hamilton's Crossing, some three miles below
Fredericksburg, and to sit for his last portrait.At a glance one can feel
the self-expression and power in this stern worshiper of the God of
Battles; one can understand the eulogy written by the British military
historian, Henderson: "The fame of 'Stonewall' Jackson is no longer the
exclusive property of Virginia and the South; it has become the birthright
of every man privileged to call himself an American."[Illustration: WHERE "STONEWALL" JACKSON FELL]

In this tangled nook Lee's right-hand man was shot through a terrible
mistake of his own soldiers.After his
brilliant flank march, the evening attack on the rear of Hooker's army had
just been driven home.About half-past eight, Jackson had ridden beyond
his lines to reconnoiter for the final advance.A single rifle-shot rang
out in the darkness.The outposts of the two armies were engaged.Jackson
turned toward his own line, where the Eighteenth North Carolina was
stationed.The regiment, keenly on the alert and startled by the group of
strange horsemen riding through the gloom, fired a volley that brought
several men and horses to the earth.Jackson was struck once in the right
hand and twice in the left arm, a little below the shoulder.His horse
dashed among the trees; but with his bleeding right hand Jackson succeeded
in seizing the reins and turning the frantic animal back into the road.Only with difficulty was the general taken to the rear so that his wounds
might be dressed.To his attendants he said, "Tell them simply that you
have a wounded Confederate officer."To one who asked if he was seriously
hurt, he replied: "Don't bother yourself about me.Win the battle first
and attend to the wounded afterward."He was taken to Guiney's Station.At
first it was hoped that he would recover, but pneumonia set in and his
strength gradually ebbed.On Sunday evening, May 10th, he uttered the
words which inspired the young poet, Sidney Lanier, to write his elegy,
beautiful in its serene resignation.[Illustration: THE STONE WALL AT FREDERICKSBURG

was ordered to assault it.It was defended the second time with the same
death-dealing stubbornness but with less than a fourth of the former
numbers--9,000 Confederates against 20,000 Federals.At eleven o'clock in
the morning the line of battle, under Colonel Hiram Burnham, moved out
over the awful field of the year before, supported to right and left by
flanking columns.Up to within twenty-five yards of the wall they pressed,
when again the flame of musketry fire belched forth, laying low in six
minutes 36.5 per cent.The
assailants wavered and rallied, and then with one impulse both columns and
line of battle hurled themselves upon the wall in a fierce hand-to-hand
combat.A soldier of the Seventh Massachusetts happened to peer through a
crack in a board fence and saw that it covered the flank of the double
line of Confederates in the road.Up and over the fence poured the
Federals and drove the Confederates from the heights.[Illustration: THE WORK OF ONE SHELL

thousand men had not yet come up.Hooker was unwilling to suffer further
loss without the certainty of his cooperation.The movement was the signal for increased artillery fire from
the Confederate batteries, marking the doom of the old Chancellor house.Its end was accompanied by some heartrending scenes.Major Bigelow thus
describes them: "Missiles pierced the walls or struck in the brickwork;
shells exploded in the upper rooms, setting the building on fire; the
chimneys were demolished and their fragments rained down upon the wounded
about the building.All this time the women and children (including some
slaves) of the Chancellor family, nineteen persons in all, were in the
cellar.The wounded were removed from in and around the building, men of
both armies nobly assisting one another in the work."[Illustration: RED MEN WHO SUFFERED IN SILENCE

Federal army.The Confederates enlisted many more in Missouri, Arkansas,

VICKSBURG AND PORT HUDSON

    On the banks of this, the greatest river in the world, the most
    decisive and far-reaching battle of the war was fought.Here at
    Vicksburg over one hundred thousand gallant soldiers and a powerful
    fleet of gunboats and ironclads in terrible earnestness for forty days
    and nights fought to decide whether the new Confederate States should
    be cut in twain; whether the great river should flow free to the Gulf,
    or should have its commerce hindered.We all know the result--the
    Union army under General Grant, and the Union navy under Admiral
    Porter were victorious.The Confederate army, under General Pemberton,
    numbering thirty thousand men, was captured and General Grant's army
    set free for operating in other fields.It was a staggering blow from
    which the Confederacy never rallied.--_Lieutenant-General Stephen D.
    Lee, C. S. A., at the dedication of the Massachusetts Volunteers'
    statue at the Vicksburg National Military Park, Vicksburg,
    Mississippi, November 14, 1903._


The Mississippi River, in its lower course, winds like a mighty serpent
from side to side along a vast alluvial bottom, which in places is more
than forty miles in width.On the eastern bank, these great coils here and
there sweep up to the bluffs of the highlands of Tennessee and
Mississippi.On these cliffs are situated Memphis, Port Hudson, Grand
Gulf, and Vicksburg.The most important of these from a military point of
view was Vicksburg, often called the "Gibraltar of the West."Situated two
hundred feet above the current, on a great bend of the river, its cannon
could command the waterway for miles in either direction, while the
obstacles in the way of a land approach were almost equally
insurmountable.The Union arms had captured New Orleans, in the spring of 1862, and
Memphis in June of that year; but the Confederates still held Vicksburg
and Port Hudson and the two hundred and fifty miles of river that lies
between them.The military object of the Federal armies in the West was
to gain control of the entire course of the great Mississippi that it
might "roll unvexed to the sea," to use Lincoln's terse expression, and
that the rich States of the Southwest, from which the Confederacy drew
large supplies and thousands of men for her armies, might be cut off from
the rest of the South.If Vicksburg were captured, Port Hudson must fall.The problem, therefore, was how to get control of Vicksburg.On the promotion of Halleck to the command of all the armies of the North,
with headquarters at Washington, Grant was left in superior command in the
West and the great task before him was the capture of the "Gibraltar of
the West."Vicksburg might have been occupied by the Northern armies at
any time during the first half of the year 1862, but in June of that year
General Bragg sent Van Dorn with a force of fifteen thousand to occupy and
fortify the heights.Van Dorn was a man of prodigious energy.In a short
time he had hundreds of men at work planting batteries, digging rifle-pits
above the water front and in the rear of the town, mounting heavy guns and
building bomb-proof magazines in tiers along the hillsides.All through
the summer, the work progressed under the direction of Engineer S. H.
Lockett, and by the coming of winter the city was a veritable Gibraltar.From the uncompleted batteries on the Vicksburg bluffs, the citizens and
the garrison soldiers viewed the advance division of Farragut's fleet,
under Commander Lee, in the river, on May 18, 1862.Fifteen hundred
infantry were on board, under command of General Thomas Williams, and with
them was a battery of artillery.Williams reconnoitered the works, and
finding them too strong for his small force he returned to occupy Baton
Rouge.The authorities at Washington now sent Farragut peremptory orders
to clear the Mississippi and accordingly about the middle of June, a
flotilla of steamers and seventeen mortar schooners, under Commander D. D.
Porter, departed from New Orleans and steamed up the river.Simultaneously Farragut headed a fleet of three war vessels and seven
gunboats, carrying one hundred and six guns, toward Vicksburg from Baton
Rouge.Many transports accompanied the ships from Baton Rouge, on which
there were three thousand of Williams' troops.The last days of June witnessed the arrival of the combined naval forces
of Farragut and Porter below the Confederate stronghold.Williams
immediately disembarked his men on the Louisiana shore, opposite
Vicksburg, and they were burdened with implements required in digging
trenches and building levees.The mighty Mississippi, at this point and in those days, swept in a
majestic bend and formed a peninsula of the western, or Louisiana shore.Vicksburg was situated on the eastern, or Mississippi shore, below the top
of the bend.Its batteries of cannon commanded the river approach for
miles in either direction.Federal engineers quickly recognized the
strategic position of the citadel on the bluff; and also as quickly saw a
method by which the passage up and down the river could be made
comparatively safe for their vessels, and at the same time place Vicksburg
"high and dry" by cutting a channel for the Mississippi through the neck
of land that now held it in its sinuous course.While Farragut stormed the Confederate batteries at Vicksburg, Williams
began the tremendous task of diverting the mighty current across the
peninsula.Farragut's bombardment by his entire fleet failed to silence
Vicksburg's cannon-guards, although the defenders likewise failed to stop
the progress of the fleet.The Federal naval commander then determined to
dash past the fortifications, trusting to the speed of his vessels and the
stoutness of their armor to survive the tremendous cannonade that would
fall upon his flotilla.Early in the morning of June 28th the thrilling
race against death began, and after two hours of terrific bombardment
aided by the mortar boats stationed on both banks, Farragut's fleet with
the exception of three vessels passed through the raging inferno to the
waters above Vicksburg, with a loss of fifteen killed and thirty wounded.On the 1st of July Flag-Officer Davis with his river gunboats arrived from
Memphis and joined Farragut.Williams and his men, including one thousand <DW64>s, labored like Titans
to complete their canal, but a sudden rise of the river swept away the
barriers with a terrific roar, and the days of herculean labor went for
naught.Again Williams' attempt to subdue the stronghold was abandoned,
and he returned with his men when Farragut did, on July 24th, to Baton
Rouge to meet death there on August 5th when General Breckinridge made a
desperate but unsuccessful attempt to drive the Union forces from the
Louisiana capital.Farragut urged upon General Halleck the importance of occupying the city
on the bluff with a portion of his army; but that general gave no heed;
and while even then it was too late to secure the prize without a contest,
it would have been easy in comparison to that which it required a year
later.In the mean time, the river steamers took an important part in the
preliminary operations against the city.Davis remained at Memphis with
his fleet for about three weeks after the occupation of that city on the
6th of June, meanwhile sending four gunboats and a transport up the White
River, with the Forty-sixth Indiana regiment, under Colonel Fitch.The
object of the expedition, undertaken at Halleck's command, was to destroy
Confederate batteries and to open communication with General Curtis, who
was approaching from the west.It failed in the latter purpose but did
some effective work with the Southern batteries along the way.The one extraordinary incident of the expedition was the disabling of the
_Mound City_, one of the ironclad gunboats, and the great loss of life
that it occasioned.Charles the troops under Fitch were
landed, and the _Mound City_ moving up the river, was fired on by
concealed batteries under the direction of Lieutenant Dunnington.A
32-pound shot struck the vessel, crashed through the side and passed
through the steam-drum.Many of
the men were so quickly enveloped in the scalding vapor that they had no
chance to escape.Others leaped overboard, some being drowned and some
rescued through the efforts of the _Conestoga_ which was lying near.While
straining every nerve to save their lives, the men had to endure a shower
of bullets from Confederate sharpshooters on the river banks.Of the one
hundred and seventy-five officers and men of the _Mound City_ only
twenty-five escaped death or injury in that fearful catastrophe.Meanwhile, Colonel Fitch with his land forces rushed upon the Confederate
batteries and captured them.The unfortunate vessel was at length repaired
and returned to service.For some time it had been known in Federal military and naval circles that
a powerful ironclad similar to the famous _Monitor_ of Eastern waters was
being rushed to completion up the Yazoo.The new vessel was the
_Arkansas_.On July 15th, she steamed through the Union fleet, bravely
exchanging broadsides, and lodged safely under the guns of Vicksburg.That
evening the Federal boats in turn ran past the doughty _Arkansas_, but
failed to destroy her.The month of July had not been favorable to the Federal hopes.Farragut
had returned to New Orleans.General Williams had gone with him as far as
Baton Rouge.Davis now went with his fleet back to Helena.Halleck was
succeeded by Grant.Vicksburg entered upon a period of quiet.The city's experience of blood and fire
had only begun.During the summer and autumn of 1862, the one thought
uppermost in the mind of General Grant was how to gain possession of the
stronghold.He was already becoming known for his bull-dog tenacity.In
the autumn, two important changes took place, but one day apart.On
October 14th, General John C. Pemberton succeeded Van Dorn in command of
the defenses of Vicksburg, and on the next day David D. Porter succeeded
Davis as commander of the Federal fleet on the upper Mississippi.So arduous was the task of taking Vicksburg that the wits of General
Grant, and those of his chief adviser, General W. T. Sherman, were put to
the test in the last degree to accomplish the end.Grant knew that the
capture of this fortified city was of great importance to the Federal
cause, and that it would ever be looked upon as one of the chief acts in
the drama of the Civil War.The first plan attempted was to divide the army, Sherman taking part of it
from Memphis and down the Mississippi on transports, while Grant should
move southward along the line of the Mississippi Central Railroad to
cooperate with Sherman, his movements to be governed by the efforts of the
scattered Confederate forces in Mississippi to block him.But the whole
plan was destined to failure, through the energies of General Van Dorn and
others of the Confederate army near Grant's line of communication.The authorities at Washington preferred the river move upon Vicksburg, as
the navy could keep the line of communication open.The stronghold now
stood within a strong line of defense extending from Haynes' Bluff on the
Yazoo to Grand Gulf on the Mississippi, thirty miles below Vicksburg.To
prepare for Sherman's attack across the swamps of the Yazoo, Admiral
Porter made several expeditions up that tortuous stream to silence
batteries and remove torpedoes.In one of these he lost one of the Eads
ironclads, the _Cairo_, blown up by a torpedo, and in another the brave
Commander Gwin, one of the heroes of Shiloh, was mortally wounded.Sherman, with an army of thirty-two thousand men, left Memphis on December
20th, and landed a few days later some miles north of Vicksburg on the
banks of the Yazoo.On the 29th he made a daring attack in three columns
on the Confederate lines of defense at Chickasaw Bayou and suffered a
decisive repulse.His loss was nearly two thousand men; the Confederate
loss was scarcely two hundred.Two hundred feet above the bayou, beyond where the Federals were
approaching, towered the Chickasaw Bluffs, to which Pemberton hastened
troops from Vicksburg as soon as he learned Sherman's object.At the base
of the bluff, and stretching away to the north and west were swamps and
forests intersected by deep sloughs, overhung with dense tangles of vines
and cane-brakes.Federal valor vied with Confederate pluck in this fight
among the marshes and fever-infested jungle-land.One of Sherman's storming parties, under General G. W. Morgan, came upon a
broad and deep enlargement of the bayou, McNutt Lake, which interposed
between it and the Confederates in the rifle-pits on the <DW72>s and crest
of the bluff.In the darkness of the night of December 28th, the Federal
pontoniers labored to construct a passage-way across the lake.When
morning dawned the weary pontoniers were chagrined to discover their
well-built structure spanning a slough leading in another direction than
toward the base of the bluff.The bridge was quickly taken up, and the
Federals recommenced their labors, this time in daylight and within sight
and range of the Southern regiments on the hill.The men in blue worked
desperately to complete the span before driven away by the foe's cannon;
but the fire increased with every minute, and the Federals finally
withdrew.Another storming party attempted to assail the Confederates from across a
sandbar of the bayou, but was halted at the sight and prospect of
overcoming a fifteen-foot bank on the farther side.The crumbling bank was
surmounted with a levee three feet high; the steep sides of the barrier
had crumbled away, leaving an overhanging shelf, two feet wide.Two
companies of the Sixth Missouri regiment volunteered to cross the two
hundred yards of exposed passage, and to cut a roadway through the rotten
bank to allow their comrades a free path to the bluff beyond.To add to
the peril of the crossing, the sandbar was strewn with tangles of
undergrowth and fallen trees, and the Confederate shells and bullets were
raining upon the ground.Still, the gallant troops began their dash.From
the very start, a line of wounded and dead Missourians marked the passage
of the volunteers.The survivors reached the bank and desperately sought
to dig the roadway.From the shrubbery on the bank suddenly appeared
Confederate sharpshooters who poured their fire into the laboring
soldiers; the flame of the discharging muskets burned the clothing of the
Federals because the hostile forces were so close.Human endurance could
not stand before this carnage, and the brave Missourians fled from the
inferno.Sherman now found the northern pathway to Vicksburg impassable,
and withdrew his men to the broad Mississippi.Earlier in the same month had occurred two other events which, with the
defeat of Chickasaw, go to make up the triple disaster to the Federals.On
the 11th, General Nathan Forrest, one of the most brilliant cavalry
leaders on either side, began one of those destructive raids which
characterize the Civil War.With twenty-five hundred horsemen, Forrest
dashed unopposed through the country north of Grant's army, tore up sixty
miles of railroad and destroyed all telegraph lines.Meantime, on December 20th, the day on which Sherman left Memphis, General
Van Dorn pounced upon Holly Springs, in Mississippi, like an eagle on its
prey, capturing the guard of fifteen hundred men and burning the great
store of supplies, worth $1,500,000, which Grant had left there.Through
the raids of Forrest and Van Dorn, Grant was left without supplies and for
eleven days without communication with the outside world.He marched
northward to Grand Junction, in Tennessee, a distance of eighty miles,
living off the country.It was not until January 8, 1863, that he heard,
through Washington, of the defeat of Sherman in his assault on Chickasaw
Bluffs.Grant and Sherman had no thought of abandoning Vicksburg because of this
failure.But a month of unfortunate military dissension over rank in the
command of Sherman's army resulted in General John A. McClernand, armed
with authority from Washington, coming down from Illinois and superseding
Sherman.On January 11, 1864, he captured Arkansas Post, a stronghold on
the Arkansas River.But Grant, having authority to supersede McClernand in
the general proceedings against Vicksburg, did so, on January 30th, and
arguments on military precedence were forgotten.Grant was determined to lead his Army of the Tennessee below Vicksburg and
approach the city from the south, without breaking with his base of
supplies up the river.Two projects, both of which were destined to fail,
were under way during the winter and spring months of 1863.One of these
was to open a way for the river craft through Lake Providence, west of the
Mississippi, through various bayous and rivers into the Red River, a
detour of four hundred miles.Another plan was to cut a channel through the peninsula of the great bend
of the Mississippi, opposite Vicksburg.For six weeks, thousands of men
worked like marmots digging this ditch; but, meantime, the river was
rising and, on March 8th, it broke over the embankment and the men had to
run for their lives.Many horses were drowned and a great number of
implements submerged.The "Father of Waters" had put a decisive veto on
the project and it had to be given up.Still another plan that failed was
to cut through the Yazoo Pass and approach from the north by way of the
Coldwater, the Tallahatchie, and the Yazoo rivers.He _would_ take
Vicksburg.It was to transfer
his army by land down the west bank of the Mississippi to a point below
the city and approach it from the south and west.This necessitated the
running of the batteries by Porter's fleet--an extremely perilous
enterprise.The army was divided into four corps, commanded respectively
by Sherman, McClernand, McPherson, and Hurlbut.On March 29th, the movement of McClernand from Milliken's Bend
to a point opposite Grand Gulf was begun.He was soon followed by
McPherson and a few weeks later by Sherman.It required a month for the
army, with its heavy artillery, to journey through the swamps and bogs of
Louisiana.While this march was in progress, something far more exciting was taking
place on the river.Porter ran the batteries of Vicksburg with his fleet.After days of preparation the fleet of vessels, protected by cotton bales
and hay about the vital parts of the boats, with heavy logs slung near the
water-line--seven gunboats, the ram _General Price_, three transports, and
various barges were ready for the dangerous journey on the night of April
16th.Silently in the darkness, they left their station near the mouth of
the Yazoo, at a quarter past nine.For an hour and a half all was silence
and expectancy.The bluffs on the east loomed black against the night sky.Suddenly, the flash of musketry fire pierced the darkness.In a few minutes every battery overlooking the river was a center of
spurting flame.A storm of shot and shell was rained upon the passing
vessels.The water of the river
was lashed into foam by the shots and shell from the batteries.The air was filled with flying
missiles.Several houses on the Louisiana shore burst into flame and the
whole river from shore to shore was lighted with vivid distinctness.A
little later, a giant flame leaped from the bosom of the river.It burned to the
water's edge, nearly all its crew escaping to other vessels.Grant
described the scene as "magnificent, but terrible"; Sherman pronounced it
"truly sublime."By three in the morning, the fleet was below the city and ready to
cooperate with the army.One vessel had been destroyed, several others
were crippled; thirteen men had been wounded, but Grant had the assistance
he needed.About a week later, six more transports performed the same feat
and ran the batteries; each had two barges laden with forage and rations
in tow.Grant's next move was to transfer the army across the river and to secure
a base of supplies.There, on the bluff, was Grand Gulf, a tempting spot.But the Confederate guns showed menacingly over the brow of the hill.After a fruitless bombardment by the fleet on April 29th, it was decided
that a more practical place to cross the river must be sought below.Meanwhile, Sherman was ordered by his chief to advance upon the formidable
Haynes' Bluff, on the Yazoo River, some miles above the scene of his
repulse in the preceding December.The message had said, "Make a
demonstration on Haynes' Bluff, and make all the _show_ possible."Sherman's transports, and three of Porter's gunboats, were closely
followed by the Confederate soldiers who had been stationed at the series
of defenses on the range of hills, and when they arrived at Snyder's Mill,
just below Haynes' Bluff, on April 30th, General Hebert and several
Louisiana regiments were awaiting them.On that day and the next the
Confederates fiercely engaged the Union fleet and troops, and on May 2d
Sherman withdrew his forces to the western bank of the Mississippi and
hastened to Grant.The Confederates
had been prevented from sending reenforcements to Grand Gulf, and Grant's
crossing was greatly facilitated.The fleet passed the batteries of Grand Gulf and stopped at Bruinsburg,
six miles below.A landing was soon made, the army taken across on April
30th, and a march to Port Gibson, twelve miles inland, was begun.General
Bowen, Confederate commander at Grand Gulf, came out and offered battle.He was greatly outnumbered, but his troops fought gallantly throughout
most of the day, May 1st, before yielding the field.Port Gibson was then
occupied by the Union army, and Grand Gulf, no longer tenable, was
abandoned by the Confederates.Grant now prepared for a campaign into the interior of Mississippi.His
first intention was to cooperate with General Banks in the capture of Port
Hudson, after which they would move together upon Vicksburg.But hearing
that Banks would not arrive for ten days, Grant decided that he would
proceed to the task before him without delay.His army at that time
numbered about forty-three thousand.That under Pemberton probably forty
thousand, while there were fifteen thousand Confederate troops at Jackson,
Mississippi, soon to be commanded by General Joseph E. Johnston, who was
hastening to that capital.The Federal leader now determined on the bold plan of making a dash into
the interior of Mississippi, beating Johnston and turning on Pemberton
before their forces could be joined.This campaign is pronounced the most
brilliant in the Civil War.It was truly Napoleonic in conception and
execution.Grant knew that his base of supplies at Grand Gulf would be cut
off by Pemberton as soon as he moved away from it.He decided, therefore,
against the advice of his generals, to abandon his base altogether.With a few days'
rations in their haversacks the troops were to make a dash that would
possibly take several weeks into the heart of a hostile country.When General Halleck heard of Grant's daring
scheme he wired the latter from Washington, ordering him to move his army
down the river and cooperate with Banks.Fortunately, this order was
received too late to interfere with Grant's plans.As soon as Sherman's divisions joined the main army the march was begun,
on May 7th.An advance of this character must be made with the greatest
celerity and Grant's army showed amazing speed.McPherson, who commanded
the right wing, proceeded toward Jackson by way of Raymond and at the
latter place encountered five thousand Confederates, on May 12th, who
blocked his way and were prepared for fight.McPherson was completely successful and the Confederates
hastened to join their comrades in Jackson.He moved on toward Jackson, and as the last of his
command left Raymond the advance of Sherman's corps reached it.That
night, May 13th, Grant ordered McPherson and Sherman to march upon Jackson
next morning by different roads, while McClernand was held in the rear
near enough to reenforce either in case of need.The rain fell in torrents
that night and, as Grant reported, in places the water was a foot deep in
the road.At eleven o'clock
in the morning of the 14th, a concerted attack was made on the capital of
Mississippi.A few hours' brisk fighting concluded this act of the drama,
and the Stars and Stripes were unfurled on the State capitol.Among the
spoils were seventeen heavy guns.That night, Grant slept in the house
which Johnston had occupied the night before.Meantime, Johnston had ordered Pemberton to detain Grant by attacking him
in the rear.But Pemberton considered it more advisable to move toward
Grand Gulf to separate Grant from his base of supplies, not knowing that
Grant had abandoned his base.And now, with Johnston's army scattered,
Grant left Sherman to burn bridges and military factories, and to tear up
the railroads about Jackson while he turned fiercely on Pemberton.McPherson's corps took the lead.Grant called on McClernand to follow
without delay.Then, hearing that Pemberton was marching toward him, he
called on Sherman to hasten from Jackson.At Champion's Hill (Baker's
Creek) Pemberton stood in the way, with eighteen thousand men.The battle was soon in progress--the heaviest of the campaign.It
continued for seven or eight hours.The Confederates were defeated with a
loss of nearly all their artillery and about half their force, including
four thousand men who were cut off from the main army and failed to rejoin
it.On the banks of the Big Black River, a few miles westward, the
Confederates made another stand, and here the fifth battle of the
investment of Vicksburg took place.The
Confederates suffered heavy losses and the remainder hastened to the
defenses of Vicksburg.They had set fire to the bridge across the Big
Black, and Grant's army was detained for a day--until the Confederates
were safely lodged in the city.The Federal army now invested Vicksburg, occupying the surrounding hills.It was May 18th when the remarkable campaign to reach Vicksburg came to an
end.In eighteen days, the army had marched one hundred and eighty miles
through a hostile country, fought and won five battles, captured a State
capital, had taken twenty-seven heavy cannon and sixty field-pieces, and
had slain or wounded six thousand men and captured as many more.As Grant
and Sherman rode out on the hill north of the city, the latter broke into
enthusiastic admiration of his chief, declaring that up to that moment he
had felt no assurance of success, and pronouncing the campaign one of the
greatest in history.The great problem of investing Vicksburg was solved at last.Around the
doomed city gleamed the thousands of bayonets of the Union army.The
inhabitants and the army that had fled to it as a city of refuge were
penned in.But the Confederacy was not to yield without a stubborn
resistance.On May 19th, an advance was made on the works and the
besieging lines drew nearer and tightened their coils.Three days later,
on May 22nd, Grant ordered a grand assault by his whole army.The troops,
flushed with their victories of the past three weeks, were eager for the
attack.All the corps commanders set their watches by Grant's in order to
begin the assault at all points at the same moment--ten o'clock in the
morning.At the appointed time, the cannon from the encircling lines burst
forth in a deafening roar.Then came the answering thunders from the
mortar-boats on the Louisiana shore and from the gunboats anchored beneath
the bluff.The gunboats' fire was answered from within the bastions
protecting the city.The opening of the heavy guns on the land side was
followed by the sharper crackle of musketry--thousands of shots,
indistinguishable in a continuous roll.The men in the Federal lines leaped from their hiding places and ran to
the parapets in the face of a murderous fire from the defenders of the
city, only to be mowed down by hundreds.Others came, crawling over the
bodies of their fallen comrades--now and then they planted their colors on
the battlements of the besieged city, to be cut down by the galling
Confederate fire.Thus it continued hour after hour, until the coming of
darkness.The Union loss was about three thousand
brave men; the Confederate loss was probably not much over five hundred.Grant had made a fearful sacrifice; he was paying a high price but he had
a reason for so doing--Johnston with a reenforcing army was threatening
him in the rear; by taking Vicksburg at this time he could have turned on
Johnston, and could have saved the Government sending any more Federal
troops; and, to use his own words, it was needed because the men "would
not have worked in the trenches with the same zeal, believing it
unnecessary, as they did after their failure, to carry the enemy's works."On the north side of the city overlooking the river, were the powerful
batteries on Fort Hill, a deadly menace to the Federal troops, and Grant
and Sherman believed that if enfiladed by the gunboats this position could
be carried.At their request Admiral Porter sent the _Cincinnati_ on May
27th to engage the Confederate guns, while four vessels below the town did
the same to the lower defenses.In half an hour five of the
_Cincinnati's_ guns were disabled; and she was in a sinking condition.She
was run toward the shore and sank in three fathoms of water.The army now settled down to a wearisome siege.For six weeks, they
encircled the city with trenches, approaching nearer and nearer to the
defending walls; they exploded mines; they shot at every head that
appeared above the parapets.One by one the defending batteries were
silenced.The sappers slowly worked their way toward the Confederate
ramparts.Miners were busy on both sides burrowing beneath the
fortifications.At three o'clock on the afternoon of June 25th a redoubt
in the Confederate works was blown into the air, breaking into millions of
fragments and disclosing guns, men, and timber.With the mine explosion,
the Federal soldiers before the redoubt began to dash into the opening,
only to meet with a withering fire from an interior parapet which the
Confederates had constructed in anticipation of this event.The carnage
was appalling to behold; and when the soldiers of the Union finally
retired they had learned a costly lesson which withheld them from attack
when another mine was exploded on July 1st.Meantime, let us take a view of the river below and the life of the people
within the doomed city.Far down the river, two hundred and fifty miles
from Vicksburg, was Port Hudson.The place was fortified and held by a
Confederate force under General Gardner.Like Vicksburg, it was besieged
by a Federal army, under Nathaniel P. Banks, of Cedar Mountain fame.On
May 27th, he made a desperate attack on the works and was powerfully aided
by Farragut with his fleet in the river.But aside from dismounting a few
guns and weakening the foe at a still heavier cost to their own ranks, the
Federals were unsuccessful.Again, on June 10th, and still again on the
14th, Banks made fruitless attempts to carry Port Hudson by storm.He
then, like Grant at Vicksburg, settled down to a siege.The defenders of
Port Hudson proved their courage by enduring every hardship.At Vicksburg, during the whole six weeks of the siege, the men in the
trenches worked steadily, advancing the coils about the city.Grant
received reenforcement and before the end of the siege his army numbered
over seventy thousand.Day and night, the roar of artillery continued.From the mortars across the river and from Porter's fleet the shrieking
shells rose in grand parabolic curves, bursting in midair or in the
streets of the city, spreading havoc in all directions.The people of the
city burrowed into the ground for safety.Many whole families lived in
these dismal abodes, their walls of clay being shaken by the roaring
battles that raged above the ground.In one of these dens, sixty-five
people found a home.The food supply ran low, and day by day it became
scarcer.At last, by the end of June, there was nothing to eat except mule
meat and a kind of bread made of beans and corn meal.It was ten o'clock in the morning of July 3d.White flags were seen above
the parapet.A strange quietness rested over the scene
of the long bombardment.On the afternoon of that day, the one, too, on
which was heard the last shot on the battlefield of Gettysburg, Grant and
Pemberton stood beneath an oak tree, in front of McPherson's corps, and
opened negotiations for the capitulation.On the following morning, the
Nation's birthday, about thirty thousand soldiers laid down their arms as
prisoners of war and were released on parole.The losses from May 1st to
the surrender were about ten thousand on each side.Three days later, at Port Hudson, a tremendous cheer arose from the
besieging army.The Confederates within the defenses were at a loss to
know the cause.Then some one shouted the news, "Vicksburg has
surrendered!"Port Hudson could not hope to stand alone; the greater
fortress had fallen.Two days later, July 9th, the gallant garrison, worn
and weary with the long siege, surrendered to General Banks.The whole
course of the mighty Mississippi was now under the Stars and Stripes.[Illustration: BEFORE VICKSBURG]

The close-set mouth, squared shoulders and lowering brow in this
photograph of Grant, taken in December, 1862, tell the story of the
intensity of his purpose while he was advancing upon Vicksburg--only to be
foiled by Van Dorn's raid on his line of communications at Holly Springs.His grim expression and determined jaw betokened no respite for the
Confederates, however.Six months later he marched into the coveted
stronghold.This photograph was taken by James Mullen at Oxford,
Mississippi, in December, 1862, just before Van Dorn's raid balked the
general's plans.[Illustration: AFTER VICKSBURG]

This photograph was taken in the fall of 1863, after the capture of the
Confederacy's Gibraltar had raised Grant to secure and everlasting fame.His attitude is relaxed and his eyebrows no longer mark a straight line
across the grim visage.The right brow is slightly arched with an almost
jovial expression.But the jaw is no less vigorous and determined, and the
steadfast eyes seem to be peering into that future which holds more
victories.He still has Chattanooga and his great campaigns in the East to
fight and the final magnificent struggle in the trenches at Petersburg.[Illustration: WHERE GRANT'S CAMPAIGN WAS HALTED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The second attempt to capture
Vicksburg originated with Grant.Since he had sprung into fame at Fort
Donelson early in 1862, he had done little to strengthen his reputation;
but to all urgings of his removal Lincoln replied: "I can't spare this
man; he fights."He proposed to push southward through Mississippi to
seize Jackson, the capital.If this could be accomplished, Vicksburg
(fifty miles to the west) would become untenable.At Washington his plan
was overruled to the extent of dividing his forces.Sherman, with a
separate expedition, was to move from Memphis down the Mississippi
directly against Vicksburg.It was Grant's hope that by marching on he
could unite with Sherman in an assault upon this key to the Mississippi.Pushing forward from Grand Junction, sixty miles, Grant reached Oxford
December 5, 1862, but his supplies were still drawn from Columbus,
Kentucky, over a single-track road to Holly Springs, and thence by wagon
over roads which were rapidly becoming impassable.Delay ensued in which
Van Dorn destroyed Federal stores at Holly Springs worth $1,500,000.This
put an end to Grant's advance.In the picture we see an Illinois regiment
guarding some of the 1200 Confederate prisoners taken during the advance
and here confined in the Courthouse.[Illustration: WHERE VICKSBURG'S FATE WAS SEALED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Here on May 16, 1863, Grant crowned
his daring maneuver against Vicksburg from the south with complete
success.Once across the river below Grand Gulf, after an easy victory at
Port Gibson, he was joined by Sherman.The army struck out across the
strange country south of the Big Black River and soon had driven
Pemberton's southern outposts across that stream.Grant was now on solid
ground; he had successfully turned the flank of the Confederates and he
grasped the opportunity to strike a telling blow.Pressing forward to
Raymond and Jackson, he captured both, and swept westward to meet the
astounded Pemberton, still vacillating between attempting a junction with
Johnston or attacking Grant in the rear.But Grant, moving with wonderful
precision, prevented either movement.On May 16th a battle ensued which
was most decisive around Champion's Hill.Pemberton was routed and put to
flight, and on the next day the Federals seized the crossings of the Big
Black River.Spiking their guns at Haynes' Bluff, the Confederates retired
into Vicksburg, never to come out again except as prisoners.In eighteen
days from the time he crossed the Mississippi, Grant had gained the
advantage for which the Federals had striven for more than a year at
Vicksburg.[Illustration: THE BRIDGE THE CONFEDERATES BURNED AT BIG BLACK RIVER

men fled with precipitate haste over the dreary swamp to the river and
crossed over and burned the railroad and other bridges just in time to
prevent McClernand from following.The necessary delay was aggravating to
Grant's forces.The rest of the day and night was consumed in building
bridges.Sherman had the only pontoon-train with the army and his bridge
was the first ready at Bridgeport, early in the evening.[Illustration: Vicksburg, taken under fire.COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]THE GATE TO THE MISSISSIPPI

Rover."In his album he pasted this unique photograph from the western
shore of the river where the Federal guns and mortars threw a thousand
shells into Vicksburg during the siege.The prominent building is the
courthouse, the chief landmark during the investment.Here at Vicksburg
the Confederates were making their last brave stand for the possession of
the Mississippi River, that great artery of traffic.If it were wrested
from them the main source of their supplies would be cut off.Pemberton, a
brave and capable officer and a Pennsylvanian by birth, worked
unremittingly for the cause he had espoused.Warned by the early attacks
of General Williams and Admiral Farragut, he had left no stone unturned to
render Vicksburg strongly defended.It had proved impregnable to attack on
the north and east, and the powerful batteries planted on the river-front
could not be silenced by the fleet nor by the guns of the Federals on the
opposite shore.But Grant's masterful maneuver of cutting loose from his
base and advancing from the south had at last out-generaled both Pemberton
and Johnston.Nevertheless, Pemberton stoutly held his defenses.His high
river-battery is photographed below, as it frowned upon the Federals
opposite.[Illustration]


[Illustration: THE WELL-DEFENDED CITADEL

gathered his twenty-one thousand troops to make the last stand for the
saving of the Mississippi to the Confederacy.In the upper picture we see
Fort Castle, one of the strongest defenses of the Confederacy.It had full
sweep of the river; here "Whistling Dick" (one of the most powerful guns
in possession of the South) did deadly work.In the lower picture we see
the fortifications to the east of the town, before which Grant's army was
now entrenching.When Vicksburg had first been threatened in 1862, the
Confederate fortifications had been laid out and work begun on them in
haste with but five hundred spades, many of the soldiers delving with
their bayonets.The sites were so well chosen and the work so well done
that they had withstood attacks for a year.They were to hold out still
longer.By May 18th the Federals had completely invested Vicksburg, and
Grant and Sherman rode out to Haynes' Bluff to view the open river to the
north, down which abundant supplies were now coming for the army.Sherman,
who had not believed that the plan could succeed, frankly acknowledged his
mistake.Sherman, assaulting the
fortifications of Vicksburg, the next day, was repulsed.A second attack,
on the 22d, failed and on the 25th Grant settled down to starve Pemberton
out.[Illustration]


[Illustration: THE WORK OF THE BESIEGERS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Battery Sherman, on the Jackson Road, before Vicksburg.Settling down to a
siege did not mean idleness for Grant's army.Fortifications had to be
opposed to the formidable one of the Confederates and a constant
bombardment kept up to silence their guns, one by one.It was to be a
drawn-out duel in which Pemberton, hoping for the long-delayed relief from
Johnston, held out bravely against starvation and even mutiny.For twelve
miles the Federal lines stretched around Vicksburg, investing it to the
river bank, north and south.More than eighty-nine battery positions were
constructed by the Federals.Battery Sherman was exceptionally well
built--not merely revetted with rails or cotton-bales and floored with
rough timber, as lack of proper material often made necessary.Gradually
the lines were drawn closer and closer as the Federals moved up their guns
to silence the works that they had failed to take in May.At the time of
the surrender Grant had more than 220 guns in position, mostly of heavy
caliber.By the 1st of July besieged and besiegers faced each other at a
distance of half-pistol shot.Starving and ravaged by disease, the
Confederates had repelled repeated attacks which depleted their forces,
while Grant, reenforced to three times their number, was showered with
supplies and ammunition that he might bring about the long-delayed victory
which the North had been eagerly awaiting since Chancellorsville.[Illustration: INVESTING BY INCHES

<DW72> on the Jackson road.Upon these troops fell most of the labor of
sapping and mining, which finally resulted in the wrecking of the fort so
gallantly defended by the veterans of the Third Louisiana.As the Federal
lines crept up, the men working night and day were forced to live in
burrows.They became proficient in such gopher work as the picture shows.Up to the "White House" (Shirley's) the troops could be marched in
comparative safety, but a short distance beyond they were exposed to the
Confederate sharpshooters, who had only rifles and muskets to depend on;
their artillery had long since been silenced.Near this house was
constructed "Coonskin's" Tower; it was built of railway iron and
cross-ties under the direction of Second Lieutenant Henry C. Foster, of
Company B, Twenty-third Indiana.A backwoodsman and dead-shot, he was
particularly active in paying the Confederate sharpshooters in their own
coin.He habitually wore a cap of raccoon fur, which gave him his nickname
and christened the tower, from which the interior of the Confederate works
could be seen.[Illustration: THE FIRST MONUMENT AT THE MEETING PLACE]

Independence Day, 1863, was a memorable anniversary of the nation's birth;
it brought to the anxious North the momentous news that Meade had won at
Gettysburg and that Vicksburg had fallen in the West.The marble shaft in
the picture was erected to mark the spot where Grant and Pemberton met on
July 3d to confer about the surrender.Under a tree, within a few hundred
feet of the Confederate lines, Grant greeted his adversary as an old
acquaintance.They had fought in the same division for a time in the
Mexican War.Each spoke but two sentences as to the surrender, for Grant
lived up to the nickname he gained at Donelson, and Pemberton's pride was
hurt.The former comrades walked and talked awhile on other things, and
then returned to their lines.Next day the final terms were arranged by
correspondence, and the Confederates marched out with colors flying; they
stacked their arms and, laying their colors upon them, marched back into
the city to be paroled.Those who signed the papers not to fight until
exchanged numbered 29,391.The tree where the commanders met was soon
carried away, root and branch, by relic-hunters.Subsequently the monument
which replaced it was chipped gradually into bits, and in 1866 a
64-pounder cannon took its place as a permanent memorial.[Illustration: VICKSBURG IN POSSESSION OF THE FEDERALS

In the picture the "Silver Lake" is lying off Vicksburg after its fall.While Admiral Porter was busy attacking Vicksburg with the Mississippi
squadron, Lieutenant-Commander Le Roy Fitch, with a few small gunboats,
was actively patrolling the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers.It was soon
seen that the hold upon Tennessee and Kentucky gained by the Federals by
the fall of Forts Henry and Donelson would be lost without adequate
assistance from the navy, and Admiral Porter was authorized to purchase
small light-draft river steamers and add them to Fitch's flotilla as
rapidly as they could be converted into gunboats.One of the first to be
completed was the "Silver Lake."The little stern-wheel steamer first
distinguished herself on February 3, 1863, at Dover, Tennessee, where she
(with Fitch's flotilla) assisted in routing 4,500 Confederates, who were
attacking the Federals at that place.The little vessel continued to
render yeoman's service with the other gunboats, ably assisted by General
A. W. Ellet's marine brigade.[Illustration]

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The Levee at Vicksburg, February, 1864.For seven months the Federals had
been in possession of the city, and the Mississippi--now open through its
entire course--cut off the struggling Confederacy in the East from the
South and Southwest, the storehouses of their resources and their main
dependence in continuing the struggle.But even such a blow as this,
coming on top of Gettysburg, did not force the brave people of the South
to give up the struggle.In the picture the only remaining warlike signs
are the tents on the opposite shore.But on both sides of the river the
Confederates were still desperately striving to reunite their territory.In the East another year and more of the hardest kind of fighting was
ahead; another severing in twain of the South was inevitable before peace
could come, and before the muskets could be used to shoot the crows, and
before their horses could plough the neglected fields.WITHIN THE PARAPET AT PORT HUDSON IN THE SUMMER OF 1863

These fortifications withstood every attack of Banks' powerful army from
May 24 to July 9, 1863.Like Vicksburg, Port Hudson could be reduced only
by a weary siege.These pictures, taken within the fortifications, show in
the distance the ground over which the investing army approached to the
two unsuccessful grand assaults they made upon the Confederate defenders.A continuous line of parapet,
equally strong, had been thrown up for the defense of Port Hudson,
surrounding the town for a distance of three miles and more, each end
terminating on the riverbank.Four powerful forts were located at the
salients, and the line throughout was defended by thirty pieces of field
artillery.Brigadier-General Beall, who commanded the post in 1862,
constructed these works.Major-General Frank Gardner succeeded him in
command at the close of the year.[Illustration: THE WELL-DEFENDED WORKS]

[Illustration: CONFEDERATE FORTIFICATIONS BEFORE PORT HUDSON]

Gardner was behind these defenses with a garrison of about seven thousand
when Banks approached Port Hudson for the second time on May 24th.Gardner
was under orders to evacuate the place and join his force to that of
Johnston at Jackson, Mississippi, but the courier who brought the order
arrived at the very hour when Banks began to bottle up the Confederates.On the morning of May 25th Banks drove in the Confederate skirmishers and
outposts and, with an army of thirty thousand, invested the fortifications
from the eastward.At 10 A.M., after an artillery duel of more than four
hours, the Federals advanced to the assault of the works.Fighting in a
dense forest of magnolias, amid thick undergrowth and among ravines choked
with felled timber, the progress of the troops was too slow for a telling
attack.The battle has been described as "a gigantic bushwhack."The
Federals at the center reached the ditch in front of the Confederate works
but were driven off.It had cost
Banks nearly two thousand men.[Illustration: THE GUN THAT FOOLED THE FEDERALS]

A "Quaker gun" that was mounted by the Confederates in the fortifications
on the bluff at the river-front before Port Hudson.This gun was hewn out
of a pine log and mounted on a carriage, and a black ring was painted
around the end facing the river.Throughout the siege it was mistaken by
the Federals for a piece of real ordnance.To such devices as this the
beleaguered garrison was compelled constantly to resort in order to
impress the superior forces investing Port Hudson with the idea that the
position they sought to capture was formidably defended.Port Hudson was not again attacked from the river after the
passing of Farragut's two ships.[Illustration: WITHIN "THE CITADEL"

second effort to capture the position.The only result was simply to
advance the Federal lines from fifty to two hundred yards nearer.In front

THE FUTURE ADMIRAL AS CIVIL WAR LIEUTENANT

In the fight with the batteries at Port Hudson, March 14, 1863, Farragut,
in the "Hartford" lashed to the "Albatross," got by, but the fine old
consort of the "Hartford," the "Mississippi," went down--her gunners
fighting to the last.Farragut, in anguish, could see her enveloped in
flames lighting up the river.She had grounded under the very guns of a
battery, and not until actually driven off by the flames did her men
leave her.When the "Mississippi" grounded, the shock threw her
lieutenant-commander into the river, and in confusion he swam toward the
shore; then, turning about, he swam back to his ship.Captain Smith thus
writes in his report: "I consider that I should be neglecting a most
important duty should I omit to mention the coolness of my executive
officer, Mr.Dewey, and the steady, fearless, and gallant manner in which
the officers and men of the 'Mississippi' defended her, and the orderly
and quiet manner in which she was abandoned after being thirty-five
minutes aground under the fire of the enemy's batteries.There was no
confusion in embarking the crew, and the only noise was from the enemy's
cannon."Lieutenant-Commander George Dewey, here mentioned at the age of
26, was to exemplify in Manila Bay on May 1, 1898, the lessons he was
learning from Farragut.[Illustration]

DURING THE FAMOUS ADDRESS IN DEDICATION OF THE CEMETERY

The most important American address is brief: "Fourscore and seven years
ago our fathers brought forth on this continent a new nation, conceived in
liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or
any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure.We are met on a
great battlefield of that war.We have come to dedicate a portion of that
field as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives that
that nation might live.It is altogether fitting and proper that we should
do this.But in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate,
we cannot hallow this ground.The brave men, living and dead, who
struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or
detract.The world will little note, nor long remember, what we say here,
but it can never forget what they did here.It is for us, the living,
rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought
here have thus far so nobly advanced.It is rather for us to be here
dedicated to the great task remaining before us;--that from these honored
dead, we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the
last full measure of devotion;--that we here highly resolve that these
dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation, under God, shall have
a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people,
for the people, shall not perish from the earth."[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG--THE HIGH-WATER MARK OF THE CIVIL WAR


The military operations of the American Civil War were carried on for the
most part south of the Mason and Dixon line; but the greatest and most
famous of the battles was fought on the soil of the old Keystone State,
which had given birth to the Declaration of Independence and to the
Constitution of the United States.Gettysburg is a quiet hamlet, nestling among the hills of Adams County,
and in 1863 contained about fifteen hundred inhabitants.It had been
founded in 1780 by James Gettys, who probably never dreamed that his name
thus given to the village would, through apparently accidental
circumstances, become famous in history for all time.The hills immediately around Gettysburg are not rugged or precipitous;
they are little more than gentle swells of ground, and many of them were
covered with timber when the hosts of the North and the legions of the
South fought out the destiny of the American republic on those memorable
July days in 1863.Lee's army was flushed with victory after Chancellorsville and was
strengthened by the memory of Fredericksburg.Southern hopes were high
after Hooker's defeat on the Rappahannock, in May, 1863, and public
opinion was unanimous in demanding an invasion of Northern soil.On the
other hand, the Army of the Potomac, under its several leaders, had met
with continual discouragement, and, with all its patriotism and valor, its
two years' warfare showed but few bright pages to cheer the heart of the
war-broken soldier, and to inspire the hopes of the anxious public in the
North.Leaving General Stuart with ten thousand cavalry and a part of Hill's
corps to prevent Hooker from pursuing, Lee crossed the Potomac early in
June, 1863, concentrated his army at Hagerstown, Maryland, and prepared
for a campaign in Pennsylvania, with Harrisburg as the objective.His army
was organized in three corps, under the respective commands of Longstreet,
Ewell, and A. P. Hill.Lee had divided his army so as to approach
Harrisburg by different routes and to assess the towns along the way for
large sums of money.Late in June, he was startled by the intelligence
that Stuart had failed to detain Hooker, and that the Federals had crossed
the Potomac and were in hot pursuit.Lee was quick to see that his plans must be changed.He knew that to
continue his march he must keep his army together to watch his pursuing
antagonist, and that such a course in this hostile country would mean
starvation, while the willing hands of the surrounding populace would
minister to the wants of his foe.Again, if he should scatter his forces
that they might secure the necessary supplies, the parts would be attacked
singly and destroyed.Lee saw, therefore, that he must abandon his
invasion of the North or turn upon his pursuing foe and disable him in
order to continue his march.But that foe was a giant of strength and
courage, more than equal to his own; and the coming together of two such
forces in a mighty death-struggle meant that a great battle must be
fought, a greater battle than this Western world had hitherto known.The Army of the Potomac had again changed leaders, and George Gordon Meade
was now its commander.Hooker, after a dispute with Halleck, resigned his
leadership, and Meade, the strongest of the corps commanders, was
appointed in his place, succeeding him on June 28th.The two great
armies--Union and Confederate--were scattered over portions of Maryland
and southern Pennsylvania.Both were marching northward, along almost
parallel lines.The Confederates were gradually pressing toward the east,
while the Federals were marching along a line eastward of that followed by
the Confederates.The new commander of the Army of the Potomac was keeping
his forces interposed between the legions of Lee and the Federal capital,
and watching for an opportunity to force the Confederates to battle where
the Federals would have the advantage of position.It was plain that they
must soon come together in a gigantic contest; but just where the shock of
battle would take place was yet unknown.Meade had ordered a general
movement toward Harrisburg, and General Buford was sent with four thousand
cavalry to intercept the Confederate advance guard.On the night of June 30th Buford encamped on a low hill, a mile west of
Gettysburg, and here on the following morning the famous battle had its
beginning.On the morning of July 1st the two armies were still scattered, the
extremes being forty miles apart.But General Reynolds, with two corps of
the Union army, was but a few miles away, and was hastening to Gettysburg,
while Longstreet and Hill were approaching from the west.Buford opened
the battle against Heth's division of Hill's corps.Reynolds soon joined
Buford, and three hours before noon the battle was in progress on Seminary
Ridge.Reynolds rode out to his fighting-lines on the ridge, and while
placing his troops, a little after ten o'clock in the morning, he received
a sharpshooter's bullet in the brain.John F. Reynolds, who had been promoted for gallantry at Buena Vista
in the Mexican War, was one of the bravest and ablest generals of the
Union army.No casualty of the war brought more widespread mourning to the
North than the death of Reynolds.But even this calamity could not stay the fury of the battle.By one
o'clock both sides had been greatly reenforced, and the battle-line
extended north of the town from Seminary Ridge to the bank of Rock Creek.Here for hours the roar of the battle was unceasing.About the middle of
the afternoon a breeze lifted the smoke that had enveloped the whole
battle-line in darkness, and revealed the fact that the Federals were
being pressed back toward Gettysburg.General Carl Schurz, who after
Reynolds' death directed the extreme right near Rock Creek, leaving nearly
half of his men dead or wounded on the field, retreated toward Cemetery
Hill, and in passing through the town the Confederates pursued and
captured a large number of the remainder.The left wing, now unable to
hold its position owing to the retreat of the right, was also forced back,
and it, too, took refuge on Cemetery Hill, which had been selected by
General O. O. Howard; and the first day's fight was over.It was several
hours before night, and had the Southerners known of the disorganized
condition of the Union troops, they might have pursued and captured a
large part of the army.Meade, who was still some miles from the field,
hearing of the death of Reynolds, had sent Hancock to take general command
until he himself should arrive.Hancock had ridden at full speed and arrived on the field between three
and four o'clock in the afternoon.His presence soon brought order out of
chaos.His superb bearing, his air of confidence, his promise of heavy
reenforcements during the night, all tended to inspire confidence and to
renew hope in the ranks of the discouraged army.Had this day ended the
affair at Gettysburg, the usual story of the defeat of the Army of the
Potomac would have gone forth to the world.Only the advance portions of
both armies had been engaged; and yet the battle had been a formidable
one.A great commander had fallen, and the rank
and file had suffered the fearful loss of ten thousand men.Meade reached the scene late in the night, and chose to make this field,
on which the advance of both armies had accidentally met, the place of a
general engagement.Lee had come to the same decision, and both called on
their outlying legions to make all possible speed to Gettysburg.Before
morning, nearly all the troops of both armies had reached the field.The
Union army rested with its center on Cemetery Ridge, with its right thrown
around to Culp's Hill and its left extended southward toward the rocky
peak called Round Top.The Confederate army, with its center on Seminary
Ridge, its wings extending from beyond Rock Creek on the north to a point
opposite Round Top on the south, lay in a great semi-circle, half
surrounding the Army of the Potomac.First,
"Stonewall" Jackson was gone, and second, Stuart was absent with his ten
thousand cavalry.Furthermore, Meade was on the defensive, and had the
advantage of occupying the inner ring of the huge half circle.Thus lay
the two mighty hosts, awaiting the morning, and the carnage that the day
was to bring.It seemed that the fate of the Republic was here to be
decided, and the people of the North and the South watched with breathless
eagerness for the decision about to be made at Gettysburg.The dawn of July 2d betokened a beautiful summer day in southern
Pennsylvania.The hours of the night had been spent by the two armies in
marshaling of battalions and maneuvering of corps and divisions, getting
into position for the mighty combat of the coming day.But, when morning
dawned, both armies hesitated, as if unwilling to begin the task of
bloodshed.They remained inactive, except for a stray shot here and there,
until nearly four o'clock in the afternoon.The fighting on this second day was chiefly confined to the two extremes,
the centers remaining comparatively inactive.Longstreet commanded the
Confederate right, and opposite him on the Union left was General Daniel
E. Sickles.The Confederate left wing, under Ewell, was opposite Slocum
and the Union right stationed on Culp's Hill.The plan of General Meade had been to have the corps commanded by General
Sickles connect with that of Hancock and extend southward near the base of
the Round Tops.Sickles found this ground low and disadvantageous as a
fighting-place.In his front he saw the high ground along the ridge on the
side of which the peach orchard was situated, and advanced his men to this
position, placing them along the Emmitsburg road, and back toward the
Trostle farm and the wheat-field, thus forming an angle at the peach
orchard.The left flank of Hancock's line now rested far behind the right
flank of Sickles' forces.The Third Corps was alone in its position in
advance of the Federal line.The Confederate troops later marched along
Sickles' front so that Longstreet's corps overlapped the left wing of the
Union army.The Northerners grimly watched the bristling cannon and the
files of men that faced them across the valley, as they waited for the
battle to commence.The boom of cannon from Longstreet's batteries announced the beginning of
the second day's battle.Lee had ordered Longstreet to attack Sickles in
full force.The fire was quickly answered by the Union troops, and before
long the fight extended from the peach orchard through the wheatfield and
along the whole line to the base of Little Round Top.The musketry
commenced with stray volleys here and there--then more and faster, until
there was one continuous roar, and no ear could distinguish one shot from
another.Longstreet swept forward in a magnificent line of battle, a mile
and a half long.He pressed back the Union infantry, and was seriously
threatening the artillery.At the extreme left, close to the Trostle house, Captain John Bigelow
commanded the Ninth Battery, Massachusetts Light Artillery.He was ordered
to hold his position at all hazards until reenforced.With double charges
of grape and canister, again and again he tore great gaps in the advancing
line, but it re-formed and pressed onward until the men in gray reached
the muzzles of the Federal guns.Again Bigelow fired, but the heroic band
had at last to give way to the increased numbers of the attack, which
finally resulted in a hand-to-hand struggle with a Mississippi regiment.Bigelow was wounded, and twenty-eight of his hundred and four men were
left on the bloody field, while he lost sixty-five out of eighty-eight
horses, and four of six guns.Such was one of many deeds of heroism
enacted at Gettysburg.But the most desperate struggle of the day was the fight for the
possession of Little Round Top.Just before the action began General Meade
sent his chief engineer, General G. K. Warren, to examine conditions on
the Union left.The battle was raging in the peach orchard when he came to
Little Round Top.It was unoccupied at the time, and Warren quickly saw
the great importance of preventing its occupation by the Confederates, for
the hill was the key to the whole battle-ground west and south of Cemetery
Ridge.Before long, the engineer saw Hood's division of Longstreet's corps
moving steadily toward the hill, evidently determined to occupy it.Had
Hood succeeded, the result would have been most disastrous to the Union
army, for the Confederates could then have subjected the entire Union
lines on the western edge of Cemetery Ridge to an enfilading fire.Warren
and a signal officer seized flags and waved them, to deceive the
Confederates as to the occupation of the height.Sykes' corps, marching to
the support of the left, soon came along, and Warren, dashing down the
side of the hill to meet it, caused the brigade under Colonel Vincent and
a part of that under General Weed to be detached, and these occupied the
coveted position.Hazlett's battery was dragged by hand up the rugged
<DW72> and planted on the summit.Meantime Hood's forces had come up the hill, and were striving at the very
summit; and now occurred one of the most desperate hand-to-hand conflicts
of the war--in which men forgot that they were human and tore at each
other like wild beasts.The opposing forces, not having time to reload,
charged each other with bayonets--men assaulted each other with clubbed
muskets--the Blue and the Gray grappled in mortal combat and fell dead,
side by side.The privates in the front ranks fought their way onward
until they fell, the officers sprang forward, seized the muskets from the
hands of the dying and the dead, and continued the combat.The furious
struggle continued for half an hour, when Hood's forces gave way and were
pressed down the hillside.But they rallied and advanced again by way of a
ravine on the left, and finally, after a most valiant charge, were driven
back at the point of the bayonet.Little Round Top was saved to the Union army, but the cost was appalling.The hill was covered with hundreds of the slain.Scores of the Confederate
sharpshooters had taken position among the crevasses in the Devil's Den,
where they could overlook the position on Little Round Top, and their
unerring aim spread death among the Federal officers and gunners.Colonel
O'Rourke and General Vincent were dead.General Weed was dying; and, as
Hazlett was stooping to receive Weed's last message, a sharpshooter's
bullet laid him--dead--across the body of his chief.During this attack, and for some hours thereafter, the battle continued in
the valley below on a grander scale and with demon-like fury.Sickles' whole line was pressed back to the base
of the hill from which it had advanced in the morning.Sickles' leg was
shattered by a shell, necessitating amputation, while scores of his brave
officers, and thousands of his men, lay on the field of battle when the
struggle ceased at nightfall.This valley has been appropriately named the
"Valley of Death."Before the close of this main part of the second day's battle, there was
another clash of arms, fierce but of short duration, at the other extreme
of the line.Lee had ordered Ewell to attack Cemetery Hill and Culp's Hill
on the north, held by Slocum, who had been weakened by the sending of a
large portion of the Twelfth Corps to the assistance of the left wing.Ewell had three divisions, two of which were commanded by Generals Early
and Johnson.It was nearly sunset when he sent Early to attack Cemetery
Hill.Early was repulsed after an hour's bloody and desperate hand-to-hand
fight, in which muskets and bayonets, rammers, clubs, and stones were
used.Johnson's attack on Culp's Hill was more successful.After a severe
struggle of two or three hours General Greene, who alone of the Twelfth
Corps remained on the right, succeeded, after reenforcement, in driving
the right of Johnson's division away from its entrenchments, but the left
had no difficulty in taking possession of the abandoned works of Geary and
Ruger, now gone to Round Top and Rock Creek to assist the left wing.Thus closed the second day's battle at Gettysburg.The harvest of death
had been frightful.The Union loss during the two days had exceeded twenty
thousand men; the Confederate loss was nearly equal.The Confederate army
had gained an apparent advantage in penetrating the Union breastworks on
Culp's Hill.But the Union lines, except on Culp's Hill, were unbroken.On
the night of July 2d, Lee and his generals held a council of war and
decided to make a grand final assault on Meade's center the following day.His counsel was that
Lee withdraw to the mountains, compel Meade to follow, and then turn and
attack him.But Lee was encouraged by the arrival of Pickett's division
and of Stuart's cavalry, and Longstreet's objections were overruled.Meade
and his corps commanders had met and made a like decision--that there
should be a fight to the death at Gettysburg.That night a brilliant July moon shed its luster upon the ghastly field on
which thousands of men lay, unable to rise.Their last battle was over, and their spirits had fled to the great
Beyond.But there were great numbers, torn and gashed with shot and shell,
who were still alive and calling for water or for the kindly touch of a
helping hand.Here and there in the
moonlight little rescuing parties were seeking out whom they might succor.They carried many to the improvised hospitals, where the surgeons worked
unceasingly and heroically, and many lives were saved.All through the night the Confederates were massing artillery along the
crest of Seminary Ridge.The sound horses were carefully fed and watered,
while those killed or disabled were replaced by others.The ammunition was
replenished and the guns were placed in favorable positions and made ready
for their work of destruction.On the other side, the Federals were diligently laboring in the moonlight,
and ere the coming of the day they had planted batteries on the brow of
the hill above the town as far as Little Round Top.The coming of the
morning revealed the two parallel lines of cannon, a mile apart, which
signified only too well the story of what the day would bring forth.The people of Gettysburg, which lay almost between the armies, were
awakened on that fateful morning--July 3, 1863--by the roar of artillery
from Culp's Hill, around the bend toward Rock Creek.This knoll in the
woods had, as we have seen, been taken by Johnson's men the night before.When Geary and Ruger returned and found their entrenchments occupied by
the Confederates they determined to recapture them in the morning, and
began firing their guns at daybreak.Seven hours of fierce bombardment and
daring charges were required to regain them.Every rod of space was
disputed at the cost of many a brave man's life.At eleven o'clock this
portion of the Twelfth Corps was again in its old position.But the most desperate onset of the three days' battle was yet to
come--Pickett's charge on Cemetery Ridge--preceded by the heaviest
cannonading ever heard on the American continent.With the exception of the contest at Culp's Hill and a cavalry fight east
of Rock Creek, the forenoon of July 3d passed with only an occasional
exchange of shots at irregular intervals.At noon there was a lull, almost
a deep silence, over the whole field.It was the ominous calm that
precedes the storm.At one o'clock signal guns were fired on Seminary
Ridge, and a few moments later there was a terrific outburst from one
hundred and fifty Confederate guns, and the whole crest of the ridge, for
two miles, was a line of flame.The scores of batteries were soon enveloped in smoke, through which the
flashes of burning powder were incessant.The long line of Federal guns withheld their fire for some minutes, when
they burst forth, answering the thunder of those on the opposite hill.An
eye-witness declares that the whole sky seemed filled with screaming
shells, whose sharp explosions, as they burst in mid-air, with the
hurtling of the fragments, formed a running accompaniment to the deep,
tremendous roar of the guns.Many of the Confederate shots went wild, passing over the Union army and
plowing up the earth on the other side of Cemetery Ridge.But others were
better aimed and burst among the Federal batteries, in one of which
twenty-seven out of thirty-six horses were killed in ten minutes.The
Confederate fire seemed to be concentrated upon one point between Cemetery
Ridge and Little Round Top, near a clump of scrub oaks.Here the batteries
were demolished and men and horses were slain by scores.The spot has been
called "Bloody Angle."The Federal fire proved equally accurate and the destruction on Seminary
Ridge was appalling.For nearly two hours the hills shook with the
tremendous cannonading, when it gradually slackened and ceased.The Union
army now prepared for the more deadly charge of infantry which it felt was
sure to follow.As the cannon smoke drifted away from between
the lines fifteen thousand of Longstreet's corps emerged in grand columns
from the wooded crest of Seminary Ridge under the command of General
Pickett on the right and General Pettigrew on the left.Longstreet had
planned the attack with a view to passing around Round Top, and gaining it
by flank and reverse attack, but Lee, when he came upon the scene a few
moments after the final orders had been given, directed the advance to be
made straight toward the Federal main position on Cemetery Ridge.The charge was one of the most daring in warfare.The distance to the
Federal lines was a mile.For half the distance the troops marched gayly,
with flying banners and glittering bayonets.Then came the burst of
Federal cannon, and the Confederate ranks were torn with exploding shells.Pettigrew's columns began to waver, but the lines re-formed and marched
on.When they came within musket-range, Hancock's infantry opened a
terrific fire, but the valiant band only quickened its pace and returned
the fire with volley after volley.Pettigrew's troops succumbed to the
storm.For now the lines in blue were fast converging.Federal troops from
all parts of the line now rushed to the aid of those in front of Pickett.The batteries which had been sending shell and solid shot changed their
ammunition, and double charges of grape and canister were hurled into the
column as it bravely pressed into the sea of flame.The Confederates came
close to the Federal lines and paused to close their ranks.Each moment
the fury of the storm from the Federal guns increased."Forward," again rang the command along the line of the Confederate front,
and the Southerners dashed on.The first line of the Federals was driven
back.A stone wall behind them gave protection to the next Federal force.Riflemen rose from behind and hurled a
death-dealing volley into the Confederate ranks.A defiant cheer answered
the volley, and the Southerners placed their battle-flags on the ramparts.General Armistead grasped the flag from the hand of a falling bearer, and
leaped upon the wall, waving it in triumph.Almost instantly he fell
among the Federal troops, mortally wounded.General Garnett, leading his
brigade, fell dead close to the Federal line.General Kemper sank,
wounded, into the arms of one of his men.Troops from all directions rushed upon
him.Clubbed muskets and barrel-staves now became weapons of warfare.The
Confederates began surrendering in masses and Pickett ordered a retreat.Yet the energy of the indomitable Confederates was not spent.Several
supporting brigades moved forward, and only succumbed when they
encountered two regiments of Stannard's Vermont brigade, and the fire of
fresh batteries.As the remnant of the gallant division returned to the works on Seminary
Ridge General Lee rode out to meet them.His
features gave no evidence of his disappointment.With hat in hand he
greeted the men sympathetically."It was all my fault," he said."Now help
me to save that which remains."The
losses of the two armies reached fifty thousand, about half on either
side.More than seven thousand men had fallen dead on the field of battle.The tide could rise no higher; from this point the ebb must begin.Not
only here, but in the West the Southern cause took a downward turn; for at
this very hour of Pickett's charge, Grant and Pemberton, a thousand miles
away, stood under an oak tree on the heights above the Mississippi and
arranged for the surrender of Vicksburg.Lee could do nothing but lead his army back to Virginia.The Federals
pursued but feebly.The Union victory was not a very decisive one, but,
supported as it was by the fall of Vicksburg, the moral effect on the
nation and on the world was great.It
required but little prophetic vision to foresee that the Republic would
survive the dreadful shock of arms.[Illustration: THE CRISIS BRINGS FORTH THE MAN

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Major-General George Gordon Meade and Staff.Not men, but a man is what
counts in war, said Napoleon; and Lee had proved it true in many a bitter
lesson administered to the Army of the Potomac.At the end of June, 1863,
for the third time in ten months, that army had a new commander.Promptness and caution were equally imperative in that hour.Meade's
fitness for the post was as yet undemonstrated; he had been advanced from
the command of the Fifth Corps three days before the army was to engage in
its greatest battle.Lee must be turned back from Harrisburg and
Philadelphia and kept from striking at Baltimore and Washington, and the
somewhat scattered Army of the Potomac must be concentrated.In the very
first flush of his advancement, Meade exemplified the qualities of sound
generalship that placed his name high on the list of Federal commanders.[Illustration: ROBERT E. LEE IN 1863

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]It was with the gravest misgivings that Lee began his invasion of the
North in 1863.He was too wise a general not to realize that a crushing
defeat was possible.Yet, with Vicksburg already doomed, the effort to win
a decisive victory in the East was imperative in its importance.Magnificent was the courage and fortitude of Lee's maneuvering during that
long march which was to end in failure.Hitherto he had made every one of
his veterans count for two of their antagonists, but at Gettysburg the
odds had fallen heavily against him.Jackson, his resourceful ally, was no
more.Longstreet advised strongly against giving battle, but Lee
unwaveringly made the tragic effort which sacrificed more than a third of
his splendid army.[Illustration: HANCOCK, "THE SUPERB"

1st a foam-flecked charger dashed up Cemetery Hill bearing General
Hancock.He had galloped thirteen miles to take command.Apprised of the
loss of Reynolds, his main dependence, Meade knew that only a man of vigor
and judgment could save the situation.He chose wisely, for Hancock was
one of the best all-round soldiers that the Army of the Potomac had
developed.It was he who re-formed the shattered corps and chose the
position to be held for the decisive struggle.[Illustration: MUTE PLEADERS IN THE CAUSE OF PEACE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, BY PATRIOT PUB.There was little time that could be employed by either side in caring for
those who fell upon the fields of the almost uninterrupted fighting at
Gettysburg.On the morning of the 4th, when Lee began to abandon his
position on Seminary Ridge, opposite the Federal right, both sides sent
forth ambulance and burial details to remove the wounded and bury the dead
in the torrential rain then falling.Under cover of the hazy atmosphere,
Lee was getting his whole army in motion to retreat.Many an unfinished
shallow grave, like the one above, had to be left by the Confederates.In
this lower picture some men of the Twenty-fourth Michigan infantry are
lying dead on the field of battle.This regiment--one of the units of the
Iron Brigade--left seven distinct rows of dead as it fell back from
battle-line to battle-line, on the first day.Three-fourths of its members
were struck down.[Illustration: MEN OF THE IRON BRIGADE]


[Illustration: THE FIRST DAY'S TOLL

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The lives laid down by the blue-clad soldiers in the first day's fighting
made possible the ultimate victory at Gettysburg.The stubborn resistance
of Buford's cavalry and of the First and Eleventh Corps checked the
Confederate advance for an entire day.The delay was priceless; it enabled
Meade to concentrate his army upon the heights to the south of Gettysburg,
a position which proved impregnable.To a Pennsylvanian, General John F.
Reynolds, falls the credit of the determined stand that was made that day.Commanding the advance of the army, he promptly went to Buford's support,
bringing up his infantry and artillery to hold back the Confederates.[Illustration: McPHERSON'S WOODS]

At the edge of these woods General Reynolds was killed by a Confederate
sharpshooter in the first vigorous contest of the day.The woods lay
between the two roads upon which the Confederates were advancing from the
west, and General Doubleday (in command of the First Corps) was ordered to
take the position so that the columns of the foe could be enfiladed by the
infantry, while contending with the artillery posted on both roads.The
Iron Brigade under General Meredith was ordered to hold the ground at all
hazards.As they charged, the troops shouted: "If we can't hold it, where
will you find the men who can?"On they swept, capturing General Archer
and many of his Confederate brigade that had entered the woods from the
other side.As Archer passed to the rear, Doubleday, who had been his
classmate at West Point, greeted him with "Good morning![Illustration: FEDERAL DEAD AT GETTYSBURG, JULY 1, 1863

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.All the way from McPherson's Woods back to Cemetery Hill lay the Federal
soldiers, who had contested every foot of that retreat until nightfall.The Confederates were massing so rapidly from the west and north that
there was scant time to bring off the wounded and none for attention to
the dead.There on the field lay the shoes so much needed by the
Confederates, and the grim task of gathering them began.The dead were
stripped of arms, ammunition, caps, and accoutrements as well--in fact, of
everything that would be of the slightest use in enabling Lee's poorly
equipped army to continue the internecine strife.It was one of war's
awful expedients.[Illustration: SEMINARY RIDGE, BEYOND GETTYSBURG]

Along this road the Federals retreated toward Cemetery Hill in the late
afternoon of July 1st.The success of McPherson's Woods was but temporary,
for the Confederates under Hill were coming up in overpowering numbers,
and now Ewell's forces appeared from the north.The first Corps, under
Doubleday, "broken and defeated but not dismayed," fell back, pausing now
and again to fire a volley at the pursuing Confederates.It finally joined
the Eleventh Corps, which had also been driven back to Cemetery Hill.Lee
was on the field in time to watch the retreat of the Federals, and advised
Ewell to follow them up, but Ewell (who had lost 3,000 men) decided upon
discretion.Night fell with the beaten Federals, reinforced by the Twelfth
Corps and part of the Third, facing nearly the whole of Lee's army.[Illustration: IN THE DEVIL'S DEN

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Upon this wide, steep hill, about five hundred yards due west of Little
Round Top and one hundred feet lower, was a chasm named by the country
folk "the Devil's Den."When the position fell into the hands of the
Confederates at the end of the second day's fighting, it became the
stronghold of their sharpshooters, and well did it fulfill its name.It
was a most dangerous post to occupy, since the Federal batteries on the
Round Top were constantly shelling it in an effort to dislodge the hardy
riflemen, many of whom met the fate of the one in the picture.Their
deadly work continued, however, and many a gallant officer of the Federals
was picked off during the fighting on the afternoon of the second day.General Vincent was one of the first victims; General Weed fell likewise;
and as Lieutenant Hazlett bent over him to catch his last words, a bullet
through the head prostrated that officer lifeless on the body of his
chief.[Illustration: THE UNGUARDED LINK

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Little Round Top, the key to the Federal left at Gettysburg, which they
all but lost on the second day--was the scene of hand-to-hand fighting
rarely equaled since long-range weapons were invented.Twice the
Confederates in fierce conflict fought their way near to this summit, but
were repulsed.Had they gained it, they could have planted artillery which
would have enfiladed the left of Meade's line, and Gettysburg might have
been turned into an overwhelming defeat.Beginning at the right, the
Federal line stretched in the form of a fish-hook, with the barb resting
on Culp's Hill, the center at the bend in the hook on Cemetery Hill, and
the left (consisting of General Sickles' Third Corps) forming the shank to
the southward as far as Round Top.On his own responsibility Sickles had
advanced a portion of his line, leaving Little Round Top unprotected.Upon
this advanced line of Sickles, at the Peach Orchard on the Emmitsburg
road, the Confederates fell in an effort to turn what they supposed to be
Meade's left flank.Only the promptness of General Warren, who discovered
the gap and remedied it in time, saved the key.[Illustration: THE HEIGHT OF THE BATTLE-TIDE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Near this gate to the local cemetery of Gettysburg there stood during the
battle this sign: "All persons found using firearms in these grounds will
be prosecuted with the utmost rigor of the law."Many a soldier must have
smiled grimly at these words, for this gateway became the key of the
Federal line, the very center of the cruelest use of firearms yet seen on
this continent.On the first day Reynolds saw the value of Cemetery Hill
in case of a retreat.Howard posted his reserves here, and Hancock greatly
strengthened the position.One hundred and fifty Confederate guns were
turned against it that last afternoon.In five minutes every man of the
Federals had been forced to cover; for an hour and a half the shells fell
fast, dealing death and laying waste the summer verdure in the little
graveyard.Up to the very guns of the Federals on Cemetery Hill, Pickett
led his devoted troops.At night of the 3d it was one vast
slaughter-field.On this eminence, where thousands were buried, was
dedicated the soldiers' National Cemetery.[Illustration: PICKETT--THE MARSHALL NEY OF GETTYSBURG]

The Now-or-never Charge of Pickett's Men.When the Confederate artillery
opened at one o'clock on the afternoon of July 3d, Meade and his staff
were driven from their headquarters on Cemetery Ridge.Nothing could live
exposed on that hillside, swept by cannon that were being worked as fast
as human hands could work them.It was the beginning of Lee's last effort
to wrest victory from the odds that were against him.Longstreet, on the
morning of the 3d, had earnestly advised against renewing the battle
against the Gettysburg heights.But Lee saw that in this moment the fate
of the South hung in the balance; that if the Army of Northern Virginia
did not win, it would never again become the aggressor.Pickett's
division, as yet not engaged, was the force Lee designated for the
assault; every man was a Virginian, forming a veritable Tenth Legion in
valor.Auxiliary divisions swelled the charging column to 15,000.In the
middle of the afternoon the Federal guns ceased firing.Twice Pickett asked of Longstreet if he should go
forward."Sir, I shall lead my division
forward," said Pickett at last, and the heavy-hearted Longstreet bowed his
head.As the splendid column swept out of the woods and across the plain
the Federal guns reopened with redoubled fury.For a mile Pickett and his
men kept on, facing a deadly greeting of round shot, canister, and the
bullets of Hancock's resolute infantry.It was magnificent--but every one
of Pickett's brigade commanders went down and their men fell by scores and
hundreds around them.A hundred led by Armistead, waving his cap on his
sword-point, actually broke through and captured a battery, Armistead
falling beside a gun.Longstreet had been right
when he said: "There never was a body of fifteen thousand men who could
make that attack successfully."Before the converging Federals the thinned
ranks of Confederates drifted wearily back toward Seminary Ridge.Victory
for the South was not to be.[Illustration: MEADE'S HEADQUARTERS ON CEMETERY RIDGE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: WHERE PICKETT CHARGED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The prelude to Pickett's magnificent charge was a sudden deluge of shells
from 150 long-range Confederate guns trained upon Cemetery Ridge.General
Meade and his staff were instantly driven from their headquarters (already
illustrated) and within five minutes the concentrated artillery fire had
swept every unsheltered position on Cemetery Ridge clear of men.In the
woods, a mile and a half distant, Pickett and his men watched the effect
of the bombardment, expecting the order to "Go Forward" up the <DW72>
(shown in the picture).The Federals had instantly opened with their
eighty available guns, and for three hours the most terrific artillery
duel of the war was kept up.Then the Federal fire slackened, as though
the batteries were silenced.The Confederates' artillery ammunition also
was now low.And at
Longstreet's reluctant nod the commander led his 14,000 Virginians across
the plain in their tragic charge up Cemetery Ridge.[Illustration: GENERAL L. A. ARMISTEAD, C. S.In that historic charge was Armistead, who achieved a momentary victory
and met a hero's death.On across the Emmitsburg road came Pickett's
dauntless brigades, coolly closing up the fearful chasms torn in their
ranks by the canister.Up to the fence held by Hays' brigade dashed the
first gray line, only to be swept into confusion by a cruel enfilading
fire.Then the brigades of Armistead and Garnett moved forward, driving
Hays' brigade back through the batteries on the crest.Despite the
death-dealing bolts on all sides, Pickett determined to capture the guns;
and, at the order, Armistead, leaping the fence and waving his cap on his
sword-point, rushed forward, followed by about a hundred of his men.Up to
the very crest they fought the Federals back, and Armistead, shouting,
"Give them the cold steel, boys!"For a moment the
Confederate flag waved triumphantly over the Federal battery.For a brief
interval the fight raged fiercely at close quarters.Armistead was shot
down beside the gun he had taken, and his men were driven back.Pickett,
as he looked around the top of the ridge he had gained, could see his men
fighting all about with clubbed muskets and even flagstaffs against the
troops that were rushing in upon them from all sides.Flesh and blood
could not hold the heights against such terrible odds, and with a heart
full of anguish Pickett ordered a retreat.The despairing Longstreet,
watching from Seminary Ridge, saw through the smoke the shattered remnants
drift sullenly down the <DW72> and knew that Pickett's glorious but costly
charge was ended.[Illustration: THE MAN WHO HELD THE CENTER

man pictured here (booted and in full uniform, before his headquarters

charge.With four Pennsylvania regiments (the Sixty-Ninth, Seventy-First,
Seventy-Second, and One Hundred and Sixth) of Hancock's Second Corps, Webb
was equal to the emergency.Stirred to great deeds by the example of a
patriotic ancestry, he felt that upon his holding his position depended
the outcome of the day.His front had been the focus of the Confederate
artillery fire.Batteries to right and left of his line were practically
silenced.Young Lieutenant Cushing, mortally wounded, fired the last
serviceable gun and fell dead as Pickett's men came on.Cowan's First New
York Battery on the left of Cushing's used canister on the assailants at
less than ten yards.Webb at the head of the Seventy-Second Pennsylvania
fought back the on-rush, posting a line of slightly wounded in his rear.Webb himself fell wounded but his command checked the assault till Hall's
brilliant charge turned the tide at this point.[Illustration: MAJOR-GENERAL GEORGE ARMSTRONG CUSTER WITH GENERAL

as the head of a brigade of cavalry distinguished himself at Gettysburg.Later he served with Sheridan in the Shenandoah, won honor at Cedar Creek,
and was brevetted major-general of volunteers on October 19, 1864.Under
Sheridan he participated in the battles of Five Forks, Dinwiddie Court
House, and other important cavalry engagements of Grant's last campaign.[Illustration: SUMTER

defenses of a beleaguered city that stood so severe a bombardment as did
this bravely defended and never conquered fortress of Sumter, in
Charleston Harbor.It is estimated that about eighty thousand projectiles
were discharged from the fleet and the marsh batteries, and yet
Charleston, with its battered water-front, was not abandoned until all
other Confederate positions along the Atlantic Coast were in Federal hands
and Sherman's triumphant army was sweeping in from the West and South.The
picture shows Sumter from the Confederate Fort Johnson.The powerful
batteries in the foreground played havoc with the Federal fleet whenever
it came down the main ship-channel to engage the forts.Protected by
almost impassable swamps, morasses, and a network of creeks to the
eastward, Fort Johnson held an almost impregnable position; and from its
protection by Cummings' Point, on which was Battery Gregg, the Federal
fleet could not approach nearer than two miles.Could it have been taken
by land assault or reduced by gun-fire, Charleston would have fallen.[Illustration: WHERE SHOT AND SHELL STRUCK SUMTER]

These views show the result of the bombardment from August 17 to 23, 1863.The object was to force the surrender of the fort and thus effect an
entrance into Charleston.The report of Colonel John W. Turner, Federal
chief of artillery runs: "The fire from the breaching batteries upon
Sumter was incessant, and kept up continuously from daylight till dark,
until the evening of the 23d.... The fire upon the gorge had, by the
morning of the 23d, succeeded in destroying every gun upon the parapet of
it.The parapet and ramparts of the gorge were completely demolished for
nearly the entire length of the face, and in places everything was swept
off down to the arches, the _debris_ forming an accessible ramp to the top
of the ruins.Nothing further being gained by a longer fire upon this
face, all the guns were directed this day upon the southeasterly flank,
and continued an incessant fire throughout the day.The demolition of the
fort at the close of the day's firing was complete, so far as its
offensive powers were considered."[Illustration: SOME OF THE 450 SHOT A DAY]

the valor and dash of the Federal attack is paralleled by the heroism and
self-sacrifice of the Confederate defense, in spite of wreck and ruin.[Illustration: SCENE OF THE NIGHT ATTACK ON SUMTER, SEPTEMBER 8, 1863]

The lower picture was taken after the war, when relic-hunters had removed
the shells, and a beacon light had been erected where once stood the

the garrison repelled a bold assault with musketry fire alone, causing the
Federals severe loss.The flag of the Confederacy floated triumphantly
over the position during the whole of the long struggle.Every effort of
the Federals to reduce the crumbling ruins into submission was unavailing.It stood the continual bombardment of ironclads until it was nothing but a
mass of brickdust, but still the gallant garrison held it.It is strange
that despite the awful destruction the loss of lives within the fort was
few.For weeks the bombardment, assisted by the guns of the fleet, tore
great chasms in the parapet.Fort Sumter never fell, but was abandoned
only on the approach of Sherman's army.It had withstood continuous
efforts against it for 587 days.From April, 1863, to September of the
same year, the fortress was garrisoned by the First South Carolina
Artillery, enlisted as regulars.Afterward the garrison was made up of
detachments of infantry from Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina.Artillerists also served turns of duty during this period.[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.][Illustration: RALLYING THE LINE._Painted by C. D. Graves._

CHICKAMAUGA--THE BLOODIEST CONFLICT IN THE WEST

    In its dimensions and its murderousness the battle of Chickamauga was
    the greatest battle fought by our Western armies, and one of the
    greatest of modern times.In our Civil War it was exceeded only by
    Gettysburg and the Wilderness; in European history we may compare with
    it such battles as Neerwinden, or Malplaquet, or Waterloo.--_John
    Fiske in "The Mississippi Valley in the Civil War."_


The town of Chattanooga, Tennessee, lies in a great bend of the Tennessee
River and within a vast amphitheater of mountains, ranging in a general
southwesterly direction, and traversed at intervals by great depressions
or valleys.These passes form a natural gateway from the mid-Mississippi
valley to the seaboard States.To dislodge the Confederate army under
General Bragg from this natural fortress would remove the last barrier to
the invading Federals, and permit an easy entry upon the plains of
Georgia.The importance of this position was readily apparent to the
Confederate Government, and any approach by the Federal forces toward this
point was almost certain to be met by stubborn resistance.Rosecrans' forward movement from Murfreesboro, in the early summer of
1863, forced Bragg over the Cumberland Mountains and across the Tennessee.The Confederate leader destroyed the railroad bridge at Bridgeport and
entrenched himself in and around Chattanooga.The three Federal corps
under Crittenden, Thomas and McCook crossed the Tennessee without meeting
resistance, and began to endanger Bragg's lines of communication.But on
September 8th, before their moves had been accomplished, Bragg abandoned
his stronghold.Crittenden the next day marched around the north end of
Lookout and entered the town, while Hazen and Wagner crossed over from the
opposite bank of the Tennessee.Rosecrans believed that Bragg was in full retreat toward Rome, Georgia,
and Crittenden, leaving one brigade in Chattanooga, was ordered to pursue.Bragg encouraged his adversary in the belief that he was avoiding an
engagement and sent spies as deserters into the Federal ranks to narrate
the details of his flight.Meanwhile, he was concentrating at Lafayette,
about twenty-five miles south of Chattanooga.Hither General S. B.
Buckner, entirely too weak to cope with Burnside's heavy column
approaching from Kentucky, brought his troops from Knoxville.Breckinridge
and two brigades arrived from Mississippi, while twelve thousand of Lee's
veterans, under Lee's most trusted and illustrious lieutenant, Longstreet,
were hastening from Virginia to add their numbers to Bragg's Army of
Tennessee.The three corps of the Union army, as we have seen, were now separated
over a wide extent of territory by intervening ridges, so intent was
Rosecrans on intercepting the vanished Bragg.But the latter, by no means
vanished, and with his face toward Chattanooga, considered the position of
his antagonist and discovered his own army almost opposite the Federal
center.Crittenden was advancing toward Ringgold, and the remoteness of
Thomas' corps on his right precluded any immediate union of the Federal
forces.Bragg was quick to grasp the opportunity made by Rosecrans' division of
the army in the face of his opponent.He at once perceived the
possibilities of a master-stroke; to crush Thomas' advanced divisions with
an overwhelming force.The attempt failed, owing to a delay in the attack, which permitted the
endangered Baird and Negley to fall back.Bragg then resolved to throw
himself upon Crittenden, who had divided his corps.Polk was ordered to
advance upon that portion of it at Lee and Gordon's Mills, but when Bragg
came to the front September 13th, expecting to witness the annihilation
of the Twenty-first Corps, he found to his bitter disappointment that the
bishop-general had made no move and that Crittenden had reunited his
divisions and was safe on the west bank of the Chickamauga.Thus his
splendid chances of breaking up the Army of the Cumberland were ruined.When Bragg's position became known to Rosecrans, great was his haste to
effect the concentration of his army.Couriers dashed toward Alpine with
orders for McCook to join Thomas with the utmost celerity.The former
started at once, shortly after midnight on the 13th, in response to
Thomas's urgent call.It was a real race of life and death, attended by
the greatest hardships.Ignorant of the roads, McCook submitted his troops
to a most exhausting march, twice up and down the mountain, fifty-seven
miles of the most arduous toil, often dragging artillery up by hand and
letting it down steep declines by means of ropes.But he closed up with
Thomas on the 17th, and the Army of the Cumberland was saved from its
desperate peril.Crittenden's corps now took position at Lee and Gordon's Mills on the left
bank of Chickamauga Creek, and the Federal troops were all within
supporting distance.In the Indian tongue Chickamauga means "The River of
Death," a name strangely prophetic of that gigantic conflict soon to be
waged by these hostile forces throughout this beautiful and heretofore
peaceful valley.The Confederate army, its corps under Generals Polk, D. H. Hill, and
Buckner, was stationed on the east side of the stream, its right wing
below Lee and Gordon's Mills, and the left extending up the creek toward
Lafayette.On the Federal side Thomas was moved to the left, with
Crittenden in the center and McCook on the right.Their strength has been
estimated at fifty-five to sixty-nine thousand men.On the 18th,
Longstreet's troops were arriving from Virginia, and by the morning of the
19th the greater part of the Confederate army had crossed the
Chickamauga.The two mighty armies were now face to face, and none could
doubt that the impending struggle would be attended by frightful loss to
both sides.It was Bragg's intention to send Polk, commanding the right wing, in a
flanking movement against the Federal left under Thomas, and thus
intervene between it and Chattanooga.The first encounter, at 10 o'clock
in the morning of the 19th, resulted in a Confederate repulse, but fresh
divisions were constantly pushed forward under the deadly fire of the
Federal artillery.The Federals were gradually forced back by the
incessant charge of the Confederates; but assailed and assailant fought
with such great courage and determination that any decided advantage was
withheld from either.Meanwhile, the Federal right was hard pressed by
Hood, commanding Longstreet's corps, and a desperate battle ensued along
the entire line.It seemed, however, more like a struggle between separate
divisions than the clash of two great armies.When night descended the
Federals had been forced back from the creek, but the result had been
indecisive.Disaster to the Union army had been averted by the use of powerful
artillery when the infantry seemed unable to withstand the onslaught.Rosecrans had assumed the defensive, and his troops had so far receded as
to enable the Confederates to form their lines on all the territory fought
over on that day.During the night preparations were made in both camps
for a renewal of the battle on the following morning, which was Sunday.A
fresh disposition of the troops was made by both leaders.Near midnight
General Longstreet arrived on the field, and was once placed in command of
the Confederate left, Polk retaining the right.Not all of Longstreet's
troops arrived in time for the battle, but Bragg's force has been
estimated at fifty-one to seventy-one thousand strong.Thomas was given command of the Union left, with McCook at his right,
while Crittenden's forces occupied the center, but to the rear of both
Thomas and McCook.Thomas had spent the night in throwing up breastworks
on the brow of Snodgrass Hill, as it was anticipated that the Confederates
would concentrate their attack upon his position.Hostilities began with a general movement of the Confederate right wing in
an attempt to flank the Union left.General Bragg had ordered Polk to
begin the attack at daybreak, but it was nearly ten o'clock in the morning
before Breckinridge's division, supported by General Cleburne, advanced
upon Thomas' entrenchments.Fighting desperately, the Confederates did not
falter under the heavy fire of the Federals, and it seemed as if the
latter must be driven from their position.Rosecrans, in response to
urgent requests for reenforcements, despatched troops again and again to
the aid of Thomas, and the assault was finally repulsed.Cleburne's
division was driven back with heavy loss, and Breckinridge, unable to
retain any advantage, was forced to defend his right, which was being
seriously menaced.The battle at this point had been desperately waged,
both sides exhibiting marked courage and determination.As on the previous
day, the Confederates had been the aggressors, but the Federal troops had
resisted all attempts to invade their breastworks.However, the fortunes of battle were soon to incline to the side of the
Southern army.Bragg sent Stewart's division forward, and it pressed
Reynolds' and Brannan's men back to their entrenchments.Rosecrans sent
Wood word to close up on Reynolds.Through some misunderstanding in giving
or interpreting this order, General Wood withdrew his division from its
position on the right of Brannan.By this movement a large opening was
left almost in the center of the battle-line.Johnson's, Hindman's, and
Kershaw's divisions rushed into the gap and fell upon the Union right and
center with an impetus that was irresistible.The Confederate general,
Bushrod Johnson, has given us an unforgetable picture of the thrilling
event: "The resolute and impetuous charge, the rush of our heavy columns
sweeping out from the shadow and gloom of the forest into the open fields
flooded with sunlight, the glitter of arms, the onward dash of artillery
and mounted men, the retreat of the foe, the shouts of the hosts of our
army, the dust, the smoke, the noise of fire-arms--of whistling balls, and
grape-shot, and of bursting shell--made up a battle-scene of unsurpassed
grandeur.Here, General Hood gave me the last order I received from him on
the field, 'Go ahead and keep ahead of everything.'"A moment later, and
Hood fell, severely wounded, with a minie ball in his thigh.Wood's right brigade was shattered even before it had cleared the opening.Sheridan's entire division, and part of Davis' and Van Cleve's, were
driven from the field.Longstreet now gave a fine exhibition of his
military genius.The orders of battle were to separate the two wings of
the opposing army.But with the right wing of his opponents in hopeless
ruin, he wheeled to the right and compelled the further withdrawal of
Federal troops in order to escape being surrounded.The brave
soldier-poet, William H. Lytle, fell at the head of his brigade as he
strove to re-form his line.McCook and Crittenden were unable, in spite of
several gallant efforts, to rally their troops and keep back the onrushing
heroes of Stone's River and Bull Run.The broken mass fled in confusion
toward Chattanooga, carrying with it McCook, Crittenden, and Rosecrans.The latter telegraphed to Washington that his army had been beaten.In
this famous charge the Confederates took several thousand prisoners and
forty pieces of artillery.Flushed with victory, the Confederates now concentrated their attack upon
Thomas, who thus far, on Horseshoe Ridge and its spurs, had repelled all
attempts to dislodge him.The Confederates, with victory within their
grasp, and led by the indomitable Longstreet, swarmed up the <DW72>s in
great numbers, but they were hurled back with fearful slaughter.Thomas
was looking anxiously for Sheridan, whom, as he knew, Rosecrans had
ordered with two brigades to his support.But in Longstreet's rout of the
right wing Sheridan, with the rest, had been carried on toward
Chattanooga, and he found himself completely cut off from Thomas, as the
Confederates were moving parallel to him.Yet the indomitable Sheridan, in
spite of his terrible experience of the morning, did not give up the
attempt.Foiled in his efforts to get through McFarland's Gap, he moved
quickly on Rossville and came down the Lafayette road toward Thomas' left
flank.Meanwhile, advised by the incessant roar of musketry, General Gordon
Granger, in command of the reserve corps near Rossville, advanced rapidly
with his fresh troops.Acting with promptness and alacrity under orders,
Granger sent Steedman to Thomas' right.Directly across the line of Thomas' right was a ridge, on which Longstreet
stationed Hindman with a large command, ready for an attack on Thomas'
flank--a further and terrible menace to the nearly exhausted general, but
it was not all.In the ridge was a small gap, and through this Kershaw was
pouring his division, intent on getting to Thomas' rear.Rosecrans thus
describes the help afforded to Thomas: "Steedman, taking a regimental
color, led the column.Swift was the charge and terrible the conflict, but
the enemy was broken."The fighting grew fiercer, and at intervals was almost hand to hand.The
casualties among the officers, who frequently led their troops in person,
were mounting higher and higher as the moments passed.All the afternoon
the assaults continued, but the Union forces stood their ground.Ammunition ran dangerously low, but Steedman had brought a small supply,
and when this was distributed each man had about ten rounds.Finally, as
the sun was setting in the west, the Confederate troops advanced in a
mighty concourse.The combined forces of Kershaw, Law, Preston, and
Hindman once more rushed forward, gained possession of their lost ridge at
several points, but were unable to drive their attack home.In many places
the Union lines stood firm and both sides rested in the positions taken.The onslaught on the Federal left of the
battlefield was one of the heaviest attacks made on a single point during
the war.History records no grander spectacle than Thomas' stand at Chickamauga.He
was ever afterwards known as "The Rock of Chickamauga."Under the cover of
darkness, Thomas, having received word from Rosecrans to withdraw, retired
his army in good order to Rossville, and on the following day rejoined
Rosecrans in Chattanooga.The battle of Chickamauga, considering the
forces engaged, was one of the most destructive of the Civil War.The
Union army lost approximately sixteen thousand men, and while the loss to
the Confederate army is not definitely known, it was probably nearly
eighteen thousand.The personal daring and tenacious courage displayed in
the ranks of both armies have never been excelled on any battlefield.The
Confederate generals, Helm, Deshler, and Preston Smith were killed; Adams,
Hood, Brown, Gregg, Clayton, Hindman, and McNair were wounded.The battle is generally considered a Confederate victory,
and yet, aside from the terrible loss of human life, no distinct advantage
accrued to either side.The Federal army retained possession of
Chattanooga, but the Confederates had for the time checked the Army of the
Cumberland from a further occupation of Southern soil.It is a singular coincidence that the generals-in-chief of both armies
exercised but little supervision over the movements of their respective
troops.The brunt of the battle fell, for the most part, upon the
commanders of the wings.To the subordinate generals on each side were
awarded the highest honors.Longstreet, because of his eventful charge,
which swept the right wing of the Union army from the field, was
proclaimed the victor of Chickamauga; and to General Thomas, who by his
firmness and courage withstood the combined attack of the Confederate
forces when disaster threatened on every side, is due the brightest
laurels from the adherents of the North.[Illustration: THE CONFEDERATE LEADER AT CHICKAMAUGA

than that of any other Southern leader because of his brilliant record in
the Mexican War.In the Civil War he distinguished himself first at Shiloh
and by meritorious services thereafter.But his delays rendered him
scarcely a match for Rosecrans, to say nothing of Grant and Sherman.Flanked out of two strong positions, he missed the opportunity presented
by Rosecrans' widely separated forces and failed to crush the Army of the
Cumberland in detail, as it advanced to the battle of Chickamauga.The
error cost the Confederates the loss of Tennessee, eventually.[Illustration: THOMAS--THE "ROCK OF CHICKAMAUGA" WHO BECAME THE "SLEDGE OF
NASHVILLE"

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Major-General George Henry Thomas, Virginia-born soldier loyal to the
Union; commended for gallantry in the Seminole War, and for service in
Mexico; won the battle of Mill Spring, January 19, 1862; commanded the
right wing of the Army of the Tennessee against Corinth and at Perryville,
and the center at Stone's River.Only his stability averted overwhelming
defeat for the Federals at Chickamauga.At Lookout Mountain and Missionary
Ridge he was a host in himself.After Sherman had taken Atlanta he sent
Thomas back to Tennessee to grapple with Hood.How he crushed Hood by his
sledge-hammer blows is told in the story of "Nashville."Thomas, sitting
down in Nashville, bearing the brunt of Grant's impatience, and ignoring
completely the proddings from Washington to advance before he was ready,
while he waited grimly for the psychological moment to strike the oncoming
Confederate host under Hood, is one of the really big dramatic figures of
the entire war.It has been well said of Thomas that every promotion he
received was a reward of merit; and that during his long and varied career
as a soldier no crisis ever arose too great for his ability.[Illustration: BEFORE CHICKAMAUGA--IN THE RUSH OF EVENTS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Rarely does the camera afford such a perfectly contemporaneous record of
the march of events so momentous.This photograph shows the hotel at
Stevenson, Alabama, during the Union advance that ended in Chickamauga.Sentinels are parading the street in front of the hotel, several horses
are tied to the hotel posts, and the officers evidently have gone into the
hotel headquarters.General Alexander McDowell McCook, commanding the old
Twentieth Army Corps, took possession of the hotel as temporary
headquarters on the movement of the Army of the Cumberland from Tullahoma.On August 29, 1863, between Stevenson and Caperton's Ferry, on the
Tennessee River, McCook gathered his boats and pontoons, hidden under the
dense foliage of overhanging trees, and when ready for his crossing
suddenly launched them into and across the river.Thence the troops
marched over Sand Mountain and at length into Lookout Valley.During the
movements the army was in extreme peril, for McCook was at one time three
days' march from Thomas, so that Bragg might have annihilated the
divisions in detail.Finally the scattered corps were concentrated along
Chickamauga Creek, where the bloody struggle of September 19th and 20th
was so bravely fought.[Illustration: ON THE WAY TO CHICKAMAUGA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]This solitary observer, if he was standing here September 20, 1863,
shortly before this was photographed, certainly gazed at the base of the
hill to the left.For through the pass called Rossville Gap a column in
blue was streaming--Steedman's Division of the Reserve Corps, rushing to
aid Thomas, so sore pressed at Chickamauga.Those <DW72>s by Chickamauga
Creek witnessed the deadliest battle in the West and the highest in
percentage of killed and wounded of the entire war.It was fought as a
result of Rosecrans' attempt to maneuver Bragg out of Chattanooga.The
Federal army crossed the Tennessee River west of the city, passed through
the mountain-ranges, and came upon Bragg's line of communications.Finding
his position untenable, the Southern leader moved southward and fell upon
the united forces of Rosecrans along Chickamauga Creek.The vital point in
the Federal line was the left, held by Thomas.Should that give way, the
army would be cut off from Chattanooga, with no base to fall back on.The
heavy fighting of September 19th showed that Bragg realized the situation.For a time, the Union army was
driven back.But at nightfall Thomas had regained the lost ground.He
re-formed during the night in order to protect the road leading into
Chattanooga.Since the second day was foggy till the middle of the
forenoon, the fighting was not renewed till late.About noon a break was
made in the right of the Federal battle-line, into which the eager
Longstreet promptly hurled his men.Colonel Dodge writes: "Everything
seems lost.The entire right of the army, with Rosecrans and his staff, is
driven from the field in utter rout.But, unknown even to the commanding
general, Thomas, the Rock of Chickamauga, stands there at bay, surrounded,
facing two to one.Heedless of the wreck of one-half the army, he knows
not how to yield."[Illustration: THE TOO-ADVANCED POSITION

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Crawfish Spring, to the South of the Chickamauga Battle-field.Rosecrans,
in concentrating his troops on the 18th of September, was still possessed
of the idea that Bragg was covering his retreat upon his railroad
connections at Dalton.Instead, the Confederate commander had massed his
forces on the other side of Chickamauga and was only awaiting the arrival
of Longstreet to assume the aggressive.On the morning of the 19th,
McCook's right wing at Crawfish Spring was strongly threatened by the
Confederates, while the real attack was made against the left in an effort
to turn it and cut Rosecrans off from a retreat upon Chattanooga.All day
long, brigade after brigade was marched from the right of the Federal line
in order to extend the left under Thomas and withstand this flanking
movement.Even after nightfall, Thomas, trying to re-form his lines and
carry them still farther to the left for the work of the morrow, brought
on a sharp conflict in the darkness.The Confederates had been held back,
but at heavy cost.That night, at the Widow Glenn's house, Rosecrans
consulted his generals.The exhausted Thomas, when roused from sleep for
his opinion, invariably answered, "I would strengthen the left."There
seemed as yet to be no crisis at hand, and the council closed with a song
by the debonair McCook.[Illustration: WHERE THE LINES WERE SWEPT BACK

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Lee & Gordon's mill, seen in the picture, marked the extreme right of the
Federal line on the second day at Chickamauga.From it, northward, were
posted the commands of McCook and Crittenden, depleted by the detachments
of troops the day before to strengthen the left.All might have gone well
if the main attack of the Confederates had continued to the left, as
Rosecrans expected.But hidden in the woods, almost within a stone's throw
of the Federal right on that misty morning, was the entire corps of
Longstreet, drawn up in columns of brigades at half distance--"a
masterpiece of tactics," giving space for each column to swing right or
left.Seizing a momentous opportunity which would have lasted but thirty
minutes at the most, Longstreet hurled them through a gap which, owing to
a misunderstanding, had been left open, and the entire Federal right was
swept from the field.[Illustration: THE HOUSE WHENCE HELP CAME

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Here, at his headquarters, holding the Federal line of retreat at
Rossville Gap (the Confederate objective in the battle), General Gordon
Granger heard with increasing anxiety the sounds of the conflict, three
miles away, growing more and more ominous.Finally, in disobedience of
orders, he set in motion his three brigades to the relief of Thomas,
pushing forward two of them under Steedman.These arrived upon the field
early in the afternoon, the most critical period of the battle, as
Longstreet charged afresh on Thomas' right and rear.Seizing a
battle-flag, Steedman (at the order of General Granger) led his command in
a counter-charge which saved the Army of the Cumberland.This old house at
Rossville was built by John Ross, a chief of the Cherokee Indians, and he
lived in it till 1832, giving his name to the hamlet.Half-breed
descendants of the Cherokees who had intermarried with both whites and
<DW64>s were numerous in the vicinity of Chickamauga, and many of them
fought with their white neighbors on the Confederate side.THE BATTLES ON LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN AND MISSIONARY RIDGE

    AFTER CHATTANOOGA: "The Confederate lines... could not be rebuilt.The blue-crested
    flood which had broken these lines was not disappearing.The fountains
    which supplied it were exhaustless.It was still coming with an ever
    increasing current, swelling higher and growing more resistless.This
    triune disaster [Vicksburg, Gettysburg, Missionary Ridge] was
    especially depressing to the people because it came like a blight upon
    their hopes which had been awakened by recent Confederate
    victories."--_General John B. Gordon, C. S. A., in "Reminiscences of
    the Civil War."_


Following the defeat of Rosecrans' army at Chickamauga in September 1863
Bragg at once took strong positions on Missionary Ridge and Lookout
Mountain.From these heights he was able to besiege the entire Army of the
Cumberland in Chattanooga and obstruct the main arteries of supply to the
Federal troops.Rosecrans was forced to abandon the route along the south
bank of the Tennessee River, which led from Bridgeport, in Alabama, and to
depend exclusively upon a long and mountainous wagon road on the north
side of the river for the transportation of supplies.The Confederate
cavalry, crossing the Tennessee above Chattanooga, fell upon the trains
entangled in the mud of the Sequatchie valley, destroying in one day three
hundred wagons, and killing or capturing about eighteen hundred mules.Within a short time the wisdom of Bragg's plan became apparent; famine
threatened the Union army and several thousand horses and mules had
already died from starvation.By his relentless vigil, the Confederate
leader seemed destined to achieve a greater victory over his opponent than
had hitherto attended his efforts in actual conflict.Meanwhile, a complete reorganization of the Federal forces in the West was
effected.Under the title of the Military Division of the Mississippi, the
Departments of the Ohio, the Cumberland, and the Tennessee were united
with Grant as general commanding, and Rosecrans was replaced by Thomas at
the head of the Army of the Cumberland.A hurried concentration of the Federal forces was now ordered by General
Halleck.Hooker with fifteen thousand men of the Army of the Potomac came
rapidly by rail to Bridgeport.Sherman, with a portion of his army, about
twenty thousand strong, was summoned from Vicksburg and at once embarked
in steamers for Memphis.General Grant decided to assume personal charge
of the Federal forces; but before he reached his new command, Thomas, ably
assisted by his chief engineer, General W. F. Smith, had begun to act on a
plan which Rosecrans had conceived, and which proved in the end to be a
brilliant conception.This was to seize a low range of hills known as
Raccoon Mountain on the peninsula made by a bend of the river, on its
south side and west of Chattanooga, and establish a wagon road to Kelly's
Ferry, a point farther down the river to which supplies could be brought
by boat from Bridgeport, and at the same time communication effected with
Hooker.A direct line was not only secured to Bridgeport, but Hooker advanced with
a portion of his troops into Lookout Valley and after a short but decisive
skirmish drove the Confederates across Lookout Creek, leaving his forces
in possession of the hills he had gained.The route was now opened between
Bridgeport and Brown's Ferry; abundant supplies were at once available and
the Army of the Cumberland relieved of its perilous position.Unlike the condition which had prevailed at Chickamauga, reenforcements
from all sides were hastening to the aid of Thomas' army; Hooker was
already on the ground; Sherman was advancing rapidly from Memphis, and he
arrived in person on November 15th, while Burnside's forces at Knoxville
offered protection to the left flank of the Federal army.The disposition of the Confederate troops at this time was a formidable
one; the left flank rested on the northern end of Lookout Mountain and the
line extended a distance of twelve miles across Chattanooga Valley to
Missionary Ridge.This position was further strengthened by entrenchments
throughout the lowlands.Despite the danger which threatened his army from
the converging Union forces, General Bragg determined to attack Burnside
and despatched Longstreet with twenty thousand of his best troops to
Knoxville.His army materially weakened, the Confederate general continued
to hold the same extended position, although his combined force was
smaller than had opposed Rosecrans alone at Chickamauga.On the 23d of November, after a long and fatiguing march over roads almost
impassable by reason of continuous rains, Sherman crossed the Tennessee by
the pontoon bridge at Brown's Ferry, recrossed it above Chattanooga, and
was assigned a position to the left of the main army near the mouth of
Chickamauga Creek.Grant had now some eighty thousand men, of whom sixty
thousand were on the scene of the coming battle, and, though fearful lest
Burnside should be dislodged from his position at Knoxville, he would not
be diverted from his purpose of sweeping the Confederates from the front
of Chattanooga.It had been Grant's plan to attack on the 24th, but
information reached him that Bragg was preparing a retreat.He, therefore,
on the 23d, ordered Thomas to advance upon Bragg's center.Preparations for movement were made in full view of the Confederates; from
the appearance of the troops, clad in their best uniforms, the advance
line of the Southern army was content to watch this display, in the belief
that the maneuvering army was parading in review.Suddenly, the peaceful
pageant turned into a furious charge, before which the Confederate
pickets, taken by surprise, retreated from the first line of earthworks,
and Thomas, with little loss to either side, captured Orchard Knob,
between Chattanooga and Missionary Ridge.From this point, which was
almost a mile in advance of the position occupied during the morning,
Grant directed the movements of his army on the following day.The Federal position was of less extent than that occupied by the
Confederates.Sherman was in command of the left wing, while Thomas held
the center, and "Fighting Joe" Hooker, with the Union right in Lookout
Valley, threatened Lookout Mountain.The plan of battle was for Sherman to
engage the Confederate right and sever communications between Bragg and
Longstreet; Hooker was to carry out an assault on the Southern left flank,
and at the same time maintain connection with Bridgeport.With both wings
assailed by a superior force, it was believed that Bragg must reenforce
these positions and permit Thomas, with overwhelming numbers, to
concentrate upon the center.On the 24th, two distinct movements were in progress.Sherman met with but
little opposition in his initial attack upon the Confederate right and
promptly seized and occupied the north end of Missionary Ridge.The
Confederates, late in the afternoon, fought desperately to regain the hill
but were finally repulsed, and Sherman fortified the position he had
gained.In the mean time, Hooker, early in the day, had begun his
operations against Lookout Mountain.Standing like a lone sentinel above
the surrounding valleys, its steep, rocky, and deeply furrowed <DW72>s,
rising into a high, palisaded crest, frowned defiance upon the advancing
troops, while a well-constructed line of defenses completed the imposing
barrier.Hooker had in addition to his own troops a division of Sherman's army
(Osterhaus') which, owing to damage to the pontoon bridge at Brown's
Ferry, had been prevented from joining its own leader.As ordered by
Hooker, General Geary took his division up the valley to Wauhatchie,
crossed the creek and marched down the east bank, sweeping the
Confederate outposts before him.The remainder of the command got across
by bridges lower down.Gaining the <DW72>s of the mountain the Federal
troops rushed on in their advance.From the high palisaded summit,
invisible in the low-hanging clouds, the guns of General Stevenson's
brigades poured an iron deluge upon them.But on they went, climbing over
ledges and boulders, up hill and down, while the soldiers of the South
with musket and cannon tried in vain to check them.Position after
position was abandoned to the onrushing Federals, and by noon Geary's
advanced troops had rounded the north <DW72> of the mountain and passed
from the sight of General Hooker, who was watching the contest from a
vantage point to the west.Grant and Thomas from the headquarters on
Orchard Knob were likewise eager witnesses of the struggle, although the
haze was so dense that they caught a glimpse only now and then as the
clouds would rise.Reenforcements came to the Confederates and they availed nothing.Geary's
troops had been ordered to halt when they reached the foot of the
palisades, but fired by success they pressed impetuously forward.From its
higher position at the base of the cliff Cobham's brigade showered volley
after volley upon the Confederate main line of defense, while that of
Ireland gradually rolled up the flank.The Federal batteries on Moccasin
Point across the river were doing what they could to clear the mountain.The Southerners made a last stand in their walls and pits around the
Craven house, but were finally driven in force over rocks and precipices
into Chattanooga Valley.Such was the "battle in the clouds," a wonderful spectacle denied the
remainder of Hooker's troops holding Lookout Valley.That general says,
"From the moment we had rounded the peak of the mountain it was only from
the roar of battle and the occasional glimpses our comrades in the valley
could catch of our lines and standards that they knew of the strife or
its progress, and when from these evidences our true condition was
revealed to them their painful anxiety yielded to transports of joy which
only soldiers can feel in the earliest moments of dawning victory."By two in the afternoon the clouds had settled completely into the valley
and the ensuing darkness put an end to further operations.Hooker
established and strengthened a new position and waited for reenforcements,
which General Carlin brought from Chattanooga at five o'clock.Until after
midnight an irregular fire was kept up, but the Confederates could not
break the new line.Before dawn General Stevenson abandoned the summit,
leaving behind twenty thousand rations and the camp equipage of his three
brigades.Hooker, anticipating this move, sent several detachments to
scale the palisades.A party of six men from the Eighth Kentucky regiment,
by means of ladders, was the first to reach the summit, and the waving
Stars and Stripes greeted the rising sun of November 25th on Lookout
Mountain, amid the wild and prolonged cheers of "Fighting Joe's" valiant
troops.The fighting of Sherman and Hooker on the 24th secured to Grant's army a
distinct advantage in position.From the north end of Lookout Mountain
across Chattanooga Valley to the north end of Missionary Ridge the Union
forces maintained an unbroken front.The morning of the 25th dawned cold, and an impenetrable mist which lay
deep in the valleys was soon driven away.From Orchard Knob, a point
almost in the center of the united Federal host, General Grant watched the
preparations for the battle.At sunrise, Sherman's command was in motion.In his front, an open space intervened between his position and a ridge
held by the Confederates, while just beyond rose a much higher hill.Toward the first ridge the attacking column, under General Corse, advanced
rapidly and in full view of the foe.For a time it seemed as if the
Confederates must recede before the terrific onslaught, but the advance
was abruptly checked after a very close and stubborn struggle, when
within a short distance of the entrenchment.Unmindful of the numbers which opposed him, General Hardee not only
succeeded in repulsing the attack, but, assuming the offensive, drove back
the forces under General John E. Smith, who had sought to turn his left,
and captured several hundred prisoners.The Federals, quickly re-forming
their lines, renewed the assault and for several hours the fighting was
desperate on both sides.A general advance of the Northern forces had been
withheld, awaiting the arrival of Hooker who, under orders from Grant, was
sweeping down Chickamauga Valley, and was to operate against the
Confederate left and rear, in the expectation that Bragg would further
weaken his line by massing at those points.But Hooker's army had been
delayed several hours by repairs to the bridge crossing Chattanooga Creek.Although Sherman had failed in his attempt to turn the Confederate right
he had forced Bragg to draw heavily upon his center for reenforcements.Grant, satisfied that Hooker was not far off, ordered the signal--six guns
fired in rapid succession from the battery on Orchard Knob--for a general
advance of Thomas' army upon the Confederate center.It was now three o'clock in the afternoon.The four division commanders of
the Army of the Cumberland, Sheridan, Wood, Baird, and Johnson, gave the
word to advance.Between Orchard Knob and the base of Missionary Ridge, a
mile away, is a broad valley covered for the most part with heavy timber.This had to be crossed before the entrenchments at the foot of the hill
could be assaulted.Scarcely were the Cumberland troops in motion when
fifty pieces of artillery on the crest of Missionary Ridge opened a
terrific fire upon them.But the onward rush of the Federals was not
checked in the slightest degree.The line of entrenchments at the base was
carried with little opposition.Most of Breckinridge's men abandoned the
ditches as the Federal skirmishers approached and sought refuge up the
hill, breaking and throwing into confusion other troops as they passed
through.At the foot of Missionary Ridge Thomas' army had reached its goal.But, as General Wood has related, "the
enthusiasm and impetuosity of the troops were such that those who first
reached the entrenchments at the base of the ridge bounded over them and
pressed on up the ascent.... Moreover the entrenchments were no protection
against the artillery on the ridge.To remain would be destruction--to
return would be both expensive in life, and disgraceful.Officers and men,
all seemed impressed with this truth.... Without waiting for an order the
vast mass pressed forward in the race for glory, each man anxious to be
the first on the summit.... Artillery and musketry could not check the
impetuous assault.To have done so would
have been ruinous.Little was left to the commanders of the troops than to
cheer on the foremost--to encourage the weaker of limb and to sustain the
very few who seemed to be faint-hearted."Midway up the <DW72> was a small line of rifle-pits, but these proved of no
use in stemming the Federal tide.In the immediate front, however, Major
Weaver of the Sixtieth North Carolina rallied a sufficient number of the
demoralized Confederates to send a well-directed and effective fire upon
the advancing troops.At this point the first line of oncoming Federals
was vigorously repulsed, and thrown back to the vacated Confederate
trenches.General Bragg, noticing this, rode along the ridge to spread his
good news among the troops, but he had not gone far when word was brought
that the right flank was broken and that the Federal standard had been
seen on the summit.A second and a third flag appeared in quick
succession.Bragg sent General Bate to drive the foe back, but the
disaster was so great that the latter was unable to repair it.Even the
artillery had abandoned the infantry.The Confederate flank had gone, and
within an hour of the start from Orchard Knob the crest of Missionary
Ridge was occupied by Federal troops.He went
down the eastern <DW72>, driving all in front of him toward Chickamauga
Creek.On a more easterly ridge he rested until midnight, when he advanced
to the creek and took many prisoners and stores.While the Army of the Cumberland accomplished these things, Hooker was
advancing his divisions at charging pace from the south.Cruft was on the
crest, Osterhaus in the eastern valley, and Geary in the western--all
within easy supporting distance.Before Cruft's onrush the left wing of
Bragg's army was scattered in all directions from the ridge.Many ran down
the eastern <DW72> into Osterhaus' column and the very few who chose a way
of flight to the west, were captured by Geary.The bulk of them, however,
fell back from trench to trench upon the crest until finally, as the sun
was sinking, they found themselves surrounded by Johnson's division of the
Army of the Cumberland.Such was the fate of Stewart's division; only a
small portion of it got away.On the Confederate right Hardee held his own against Sherman, but with the
left and center routed and in rapid flight Bragg realized the day was
lost.He could do nothing but cover Breckinridge's retreat as best he
might and order Hardee to retire across Chickamauga Creek.Bragg's army had been wholly
defeated, and, after being pursued for some days, it found a resting place
at Dalton among the mountains of Georgia.The Federal victory was the
result of a campaign carefully planned by Generals Halleck and Grant and
ably carried out by the efforts of the subordinate generals.The losses in killed and wounded sustained by Grant were over fifty-eight
hundred and those of Bragg about sixty-six hundred, four thousand being
prisoners.But the advantage of the great position had been forever
wrested from the Southern army.[Illustration: THE BESIEGED

ground overlooking the stream, was posted Battery McAloon to keep the
Confederates back from the river, so that timber and firewood could be
rafted down to the besieged army.In the chill of autumn, with scanty
rations, the soldiers had a hard time keeping warm, as all fuel within the
lines had been consumed.The Army of the Cumberland was almost conquered
by hardship.Grant feared that the soldiers "could not be got out of their
trenches to assume the offensive."But it was these very men who achieved
the most signal victory in the battle of Chattanooga.[Illustration: OPENING "THE CRACKER LINE"

on the upper Tennessee River.Had the gunboats on the Ohio been able to
come up the Tennessee River nearly three hundred miles, to the assistance
of Rosecrans, Bragg could never have bottled him up in Chattanooga.But
between Florence and Decatur, Alabama, Muscle Shoals lay in the stream,
making the river impassable.While Bragg's pickets invested the railroad
and river, supplies could not be brought up from Bridgeport; and besides,
with the exception of one small steamboat (the _Dunbar_), the Federals had
no boats on the river.General W. F. Smith, Chief Engineer of the Army of
the Cumberland, had established a saw-mill with an old engine at
Bridgeport for the purpose of getting out lumber from logs rafted down the
river, with which to construct pontoons.Here Captain Arthur Edwards,
Assistant Quartermaster, had been endeavoring since the siege began to
build a steamboat consisting of a flat-bottom scow, with engine, boiler,
and stern-wheel mounted upon it.On October 24th, after many difficulties
and discouragements had been overcome, the vessel was launched
successfully and christened the _Chattanooga_.On the 29th she made her
trial trip.That very night, Hooker, in the battle of Wauhatchie,
definitely established control of the new twelve-mile "Cracker Line" from
Kelley's Ferry, which Grant had ordered for the relief of the starving
army.The next day the little _Chattanooga_, with steam up, was ready to
start from Bridgeport with a heavy load of the much-needed supplies, and
her arrival was anxiously awaited at Kelley's Ferry, where the
wagon-trains were all ready to rush forward the rations and forage to
Chattanooga.The mechanics were still at work upon the little vessel's
unfinished pilot-house and boiler-deck while she and the two barges she
was to tow were being loaded, and at 4 A.M.on November 30th she set out
to make the 45-mile journey against unfavorable head-winds.[Illustration: THE WELCOME NEWCOMER

day, and then was enveloped in one of the darkest of nights, out of which
a blinding rain stung the faces of her anxious crew.Assistant
Quartermaster William G. Le Duc, in command of the expedition, helped the
pilot to feel his way through the darkness.At last the camp-fires of the
Federals became guiding beacons from the shore and soon the _Chattanooga_
tied up safely at Kelley's Ferry.The "Cracker Line" was at last opened in

Confederates and captured Orchard Knob (or Indian Hill) a day before it
had been planned to do so.Still another surprise awaited Grant on the
25th, when from this eminence he watched the magnificent spectacle of the
battle of Chattanooga.Thomas' men again pressed forward in what was

more.At two o'clock in the afternoon the mist became so heavy that Hooker
and his men could not see what they were doing, and paused to entrench.By
four o'clock, however, he had pushed on to the summit and reported to
Grant that his position was impregnable.Direct communication was then
established and reenforcements sent.[Illustration: THE PEAK OF VICTORY--THE MORNING AFTER THE BATTLE

THE BATTLE IN THE WILDERNESS

    The volunteers who composed the armies of the Potomac and Northern
    Virginia were real soldiers now, inured to war, and desperate in their
    determination to do its work without faltering or failure.This
    fact--this change in the temper and _morale_ of the men on either
    side--had greatly simplified the tasks set for Grant and Lee to solve.They knew that those men would stand against
    anything, endure slaughter without flinching, hardship without
    complaining, and make desperate endeavor without shrinking.The two
    armies had become what they had not been earlier in the contest,
    _perfect instruments of war_, that could be relied upon as confidently
    as the machinist relies upon his engine scheduled to make so many
    revolutions per minute at a given rate of horse-power, and with the
    precision of science itself.--_George Cary Eggleston, in "The History
    of the Confederate War."_


After the battle of Gettysburg, Lee started for the Potomac, which he
crossed with some difficulty, but with little interruption from the
Federals, above Harper's Ferry, on July 14, 1863.The thwarted invader of
Pennsylvania wished to get to the plains of Virginia as quickly as
possible, but the Shenandoah was found to be impassable.Meade, in the
mean time, had crossed the Potomac east of the Blue Ridge and seized the
principal outlets from the lower part of the Valley.Lee, therefore, was
compelled to continue his retreat up the Shenandoah until Longstreet, sent
in advance with part of his command, had so blocked the Federal pursuit
that most of the Confederate army was able to emerge through Chester Gap
and move to Culpeper Court House.Ewell marched through Thornton's Gap and
by the 4th of August practically the whole Army of Northern Virginia was
south of the Rapidan, prepared to dispute the crossing of that river.But
Meade, continuing his flank pursuit, halted at Culpeper Court House,
deeming it imprudent to attempt the Rapidan in the face of the strongly
entrenched Confederates.In the entire movement there had been no fighting
except a few cavalry skirmishes and no serious loss on either side.On the 9th of September, Lee sent Longstreet and his corps to assist Bragg
in the great conflict that was seen to be inevitable around Chattanooga.In spite of reduced strength, Lee proceeded to assume a threatening
attitude toward Meade, and in October and early November there were
several small but severe engagements as the Confederate leader attempted
to turn Meade's flank and force him back to the old line of Bull Run.On
the 7th of November, Sedgwick made a brilliant capture of the redoubts on
the Rappahannock, and Lee returned once more to his old position on the
south side of the Rapidan.This lay between Barnett's Ford, near Orange
Court House (Lee's headquarters), and Morton's Ford, twenty miles below.Its right was also protected by entrenchments along the course of Mine
Run.Against these, in the last days of November, Meade sent French,
Sedgwick, and Warren.It was found impossible to carry the Confederate
position, and on December 1st the Federal troops were ordered to recross
the Rapidan.In this short campaign the Union lost sixteen hundred men and
the Confederacy half that number.With the exception of an unsuccessful
cavalry raid against Richmond, in February, nothing disturbed the
existence of the two armies until the coming of Grant.In the early months of 1864, the Army of the Potomac lay between the
Rapidan and the Rappahannock, most of it in the vicinity of Culpeper Court
House, although some of the troops were guarding the railroad to
Washington as far as Bristoe Station, close to Manassas Junction.On the
south side of the Rapidan, the Army of Northern Virginia was, as has been
seen, securely entrenched.The Confederates' ranks were thin and their
supplies were scarce; but the valiant spirit which had characterized the
Southern hosts in former battles still burned fiercely within their
breasts, presaging many desperate battles before the heel of the invader
should tread upon their cherished capital, Richmond, and their loved
cause, the Confederacy.Within the camp religious services had been held for weeks in succession,
resulting in the conversion of large numbers of the soldiers.The influence of the awakening among the men in the
army during this revival was manifest after the war was over, when the
soldiers had gone back to civil life, under conditions most trying and
severe.To this spiritual frame of mind may be credited, perhaps, some of
the remarkable feats accomplished in subsequent battles by the Confederate
army.On February 29, 1864, the United States Congress passed law reviving the
grade of lieutenant-general, the title being intended for Grant, who was
made general-in-chief of the armies of the United States.Grant had come
from his victorious battle-grounds in the West, and all eyes turned to him
as the chieftain who should lead the Union army to success.On the 9th of
March he received his commission.He now planned the final great double
movement of the war.Taking control of the whole campaign against Lee, but
leaving the Army of the Potomac under Meade's direct command, he chose the
strongest of his corps commanders, W. T. Sherman, for the head of affairs
in the West.Grant's immediate objects were to defeat Lee's army and to
capture Richmond, the latter to be accomplished by General Butler and the
Army of the James; Sherman's object was to crush Johnston, to seize that
important railroad center, Atlanta, Georgia, and, with Banks' assistance,
to open a way between the Atlantic coast and Mobile, on the Gulf, thus
dividing the Confederacy north and south, as the conquest of the
Mississippi had parted it east and west.It was believed that if either or
both of these campaigns were successful, the downfall of the Confederacy
would be assured.On a recommendation of General Meade's, the Army of the Potomac was
reorganized into three corps instead of the previous five.The Second,
Fifth, and Sixth corps were retained, absorbing the First and Third.Hancock was in command of the Second; Warren, the Fifth; and Sedgwick, the
Sixth.Sheridan was at the head of the cavalry.The Ninth Corps acted as a
separate army under Burnside, and was now protecting the Orange and
Alexandria Railroad.As soon as Meade had crossed the Rapidan, Burnside
was ordered to move promptly, and he reached the battlefield of the
Wilderness on the morning of May 6th.On May 24th his corps was assigned
to the Army of the Potomac.The Union forces, including the Ninth Corps,
numbered about one hundred and eighteen thousand men.The Army of Northern Virginia consisted of three corps of infantry, the
First under Longstreet, the Second under Ewell, and the Third under A. P.
Hill, and a cavalry corps commanded by Stuart.A notable fact in the
organization of the Confederate army was the few changes made in
commanders.The total forces under Lee were about sixty-two thousand.After assuming command, Grant established his headquarters at Culpeper
Court House, whence he visited Washington once a week to consult with
President Lincoln and the Secretary of War.He was given full authority,
however, as to men and movements, and worked out a plan of campaign which
resulted in a series of battles in Virginia unparalleled in history.The
first of these was precipitated in a dense forest, a wilderness, from
which the battle takes its name.Grant decided on a general advance of the Army of the Potomac upon Lee,
and early on the morning of May 4th the movement began by crossing the
Rapidan at several fords below Lee's entrenched position, and moving by
his right flank.The crossing was effected successfully, the line of march
taking part of the Federal troops over a scene of defeat in the previous
spring.One year before, the magnificent Army of the Potomac, just from a
long winter's rest in the encampment at Falmouth on the north bank of the
Rappahannock, had met the legions of the South in deadly combat on the
battlefield of Chancellorsville.And now Grant was leading the same army,
whose ranks had been freshened by new recruits from the North, through the
same field of war.By eight o'clock on the morning of the 4th the various rumors as to the
Federal army's crossing the Rapidan received by Lee were fully confirmed,
and at once he prepared to set his own army in motion for the Wilderness,
and to throw himself across the path of his foe.Two days before he had
gathered his corps and division commanders around him at the signal
station on Clark's Mountain, a considerable eminence south of the Rapidan,
near Robertson's Ford.Here he expressed the opinion that Grant would
cross at the lower fords, as he did, but nevertheless Longstreet was kept
at Gordonsville in case the Federals should move by the Confederate left.The day was oppressively hot, and the troops suffered greatly from thirst
as they plodded along the forest aisles through the jungle-like region.The Wilderness was a maze of trees, underbrush, and ragged foliage.Low-limbed pines, scrub-oaks, hazels, and chinkapins interlaced their
branches on the sides of rough country roads that lead through this
labyrinth of desolation.The weary troops looked upon the heavy tangles of
fallen timber and dense undergrowth with a sense of isolation.Only the
sounds of the birds in the trees, the rustling of the leaves, and the
passing of the army relieved the heavy pall of solitude that bore upon the
senses of the Federal host.The forces of the Northern army advanced into the vast no-man's land by
the roads leading from the fords.In the afternoon, Hancock was resting at
Chancellorsville, while Warren posted his corps near the Wilderness
Tavern, in which General Grant established his headquarters.Sedgwick's
corps had followed in the track of Warren's veterans, but was ordered to
halt near the river crossing, or a little south of it.The cavalry, as
much as was not covering the rear wagon trains, was stationed near
Chancellorsville and the Wilderness Tavern.That night the men from the
North lay in bivouac with little fear of being attacked in this wilderness
of waste, where military maneuvers would be very difficult.Two roads--the old Orange turnpike and the Orange plank road--enter the
Wilderness from the southwest.Along these the Confederates moved from
their entrenched position to oppose the advancing hosts of the North.Ewell took the old turnpike and Hill the plank road.Longstreet was
hastening from Gordonsville.The troops of Longstreet, on the one side,
and of Burnside, on the other, arrived on the field after exhausting
forced marches.The locality in which the Federal army found itself on the 5th of May was
not one that any commander would choose for a battle-ground.Lee was more
familiar with its terrible features than was his opponent, but this gave
him little or no advantage.Grant, having decided to move by the
Confederate right flank, could only hope to pass through the desolate
region and reach more open country before the inevitable clash would come.General Humphreys, who was Meade's chief of staff,
says in his "Virginia Campaign of 1864 and 1865": "So far as I know, no
great battle ever took place before on such ground.But little of the
combatants could be seen, and its progress was known to the senses chiefly
by the rising and falling sounds of a vast musketry fire that continually
swept along the lines of battle, many miles in length, sounds which at
times approached to the sublime."As Ewell, moving along the old turnpike on the morning of May 5th, came
near the Germanna Ford road, Warren's corps was marching down the latter
on its way to Parker's store, the destination assigned it by the orders of
the day.This meeting precipitated the battle of the Wilderness.Meade learned the position of Ewell's advance division and ordered an
attack.The Confederates were driven back a mile or two, but, re-forming
and reenforced, the tide of battle was turned the other way.Sedgwick's
marching orders were sending him to the Wilderness Tavern on the turnpike.He was on his way when the battle began, and he now turned to the right
from the Germanna Ford road and formed several of his divisions on
Warren's right.The presence of Hill on the plank road became known to
Meade and Grant, about eight in the morning.Hancock, at Chancellorsville,
was too far away to check him, so Getty's division of Sedgwick's corps, on
its way to the right, was sent over the Brock road to its junction with
the plank road for the purpose of driving Hill back, if possible, beyond
Parker's store.Warren and Sedgwick began to entrench themselves when they realized that
Ewell had effectively blocked their progress.Getty, at the junction of
the Brock and the Orange plank roads, was likewise throwing up breastworks
as fast as he could.Hancock, coming down the Brock road from
Chancellorsville, reached him at two in the afternoon and found two of A.
P. Hill's divisions in front.After waiting to finish his breastworks,
Getty, a little after four o'clock, started, with Hancock supporting him,
to carry out his orders to drive Hill back.Hancock says: "The fighting
became very fierce at once.The lines of battle were exceedingly close,
the musketry continuous and deadly along the entire line.... The battle
raged with great severity and obstinacy until about 8 P.M.Here, on the Federal left, and in this
desperate engagement, General Alexander Hays, one of Hancock's brigade
commanders, was shot through the head and killed.The afternoon had worn away with heavy skirmishing on the right.About
five o'clock Meade made another attempt on Ewell's forces.Both lines were
well entrenched, but the Confederate artillery enfiladed the Federal
positions.It was after dark when General Seymour of Sedgwick's corps
finally withdrew his brigade, with heavy loss in killed and wounded.When the battle roar had ceased, the rank and file of the Confederate
soldiers learned with sorrow of the death of one of the most dashing
brigade leaders in Ewell's corps, General John M. Jones.This fighting was
the preliminary struggle for position in the formation of the battle-lines
of the two armies, to secure the final hold for the death grapple.The
contestants were without advantage on either side when the sanguinary
day's work was finished.Both armies had constructed breastworks and were entrenched very close to
each other, front to front, gathered and poised for a deadly spring.Early
on the morning of May 6th Hancock was reenforced by Burnside, and Hill by
Longstreet.Grant issued orders, through Meade, for a general attack by Sedgwick,
Warren, and Hancock along the entire line, at five o'clock on the morning
of the 6th.Fifteen minutes before five the Confederates opened fire on
Sedgwick's right, and soon the battle was raging along the whole five-mile
front.It became a hand-to-hand contest.The Federals advanced with great
difficulty.The combatants came upon each other but a few paces apart.Soldiers on one side became hopelessly mixed with those of the other.Artillery played but little part in the battle of the Wilderness.The
cavalry of the two armies had one indecisive engagement on the 5th.The
next day both Custer and Gregg repulsed Hampton and Fitzhugh Lee in two
separate encounters, but Sheridan was unable to follow up the advantage.He had been entrusted with the care of the wagon trains and dared not take
his cavalry too far from them.The battle was chiefly one of musketry.Volley upon volley was poured out unceasingly; screaming bullets mingled
with terrific yells in the dense woods.The noise became deafening, and
the wounded and dying lying on the ground among the trees made a scene of
indescribable horror.Living men rushed in to take the places of those
who had fallen.The missiles cut branches from the trees, and saplings
were mowed down as grass in a meadow is cut by a scythe.Bloody remnants
of uniforms, blue and gray, hung as weird and uncanny decorations from
remaining branches.The story of the Federal right during the morning is easily told.Persistently and often as he tried, Warren could make no impression on the
strongly entrenched Ewell--nor could Sedgwick, who was trying equally hard
with Wright's division of his corps.But with Hancock on the left, in his
entrenchments on the Brock road, it was different.The gallant and heroic
charges here have elicited praise and admiration from friend and foe
alike.At first, Hill was forced back in disorder, and driven in confusion
a mile and a half from his line.The Confederates seemed on the verge of
panic and rout.From the rear of the troops in gray came the beloved
leader of the Southern host, General Lee.He was astride his favorite
battle-horse, and his face was set in lines of determination.Though the
crisis of the battle for the Confederates had arrived, Lee's voice was
calm and soft as he commanded, "Follow me," and then urged his charger
toward the bristling front of the Federal lines.The Confederate ranks
were electrified by the brave example of their commander.A ragged veteran
who had followed Lee through many campaigns, leaped forward and caught the
bridle-rein of the horse."We won't go on until you go back," cried the
devoted warrior.Instantly the Confederate ranks resounded with the cry,
"Lee to the rear!and the great general went back to
safety while his soldiers again took up the gage of battle and plunged
into the smoke and death-laden storm.But Lee, by his personal presence,
and the arrival of Longstreet, had restored order and courage in the
ranks, and their original position was soon regained.The pursuit of the Confederates through the dense forest had caused
confusion and disorganization in Hancock's corps.That cohesion and
strength in a battle-line of soldiers, where the men can "feel the touch,"
shoulder to shoulder, was wanting, and the usual form and regular
alignment was broken.It was two hours before the lines were re-formed.That short time had been well utilized by the Confederates.Gregg's eight
hundred Texans made a desperate charge through the thicket of the pine
against Webb's brigade of Hancock's corps, cutting through the growth, and
wildly shouting amid the crash and roar of the battle.Half of their
number were left on the field, but the blow had effectually checked the
Federal advance.While the battle was raging Grant's general demeanor was imperturbable.He
remained with Meade nearly the whole day at headquarters at the Lacy
house.He sat upon a stump most of the time, or at the foot of a tree,
leaning against its trunk, whittling sticks with his pocket-knife and
smoking big black cigars--twenty during the day.He received reports of
the progress of the battle and gave orders without the least evidence of
excitement or emotion."His orders," said one of his staff, "were given
with a spur," implying instant action.On one occasion, when an officer,
in great excitement, brought him the report of Hancock's misfortune and
expressed apprehension as to Lee's purpose, Grant exclaimed with some
warmth: "Oh, I am heartily tired of hearing what Lee is going to do.Go
back to your command and try to think what we are going to do ourselves."Several brigades of Longstreet's troops, though weary from their forced
march, were sent on a flanking movement against Hancock's left, which
demoralized Mott's division and caused it to fall back three-quarters of a
mile.Longstreet now advanced with the rest of his corps.The dashing
leader, while riding with Generals Kershaw and Jenkins at the head of
Jenkins' brigade on the right of the Southern battle array, was screened
by the tangled thickets from the view of his own troops, flushed with the
success of brilliant flank movement.Suddenly the passing column was seen
indistinctly through an opening and a volley burst forth and struck the
officers.When the smoke lifted Longstreet and Jenkins were down--the
former seriously wounded, and the latter killed outright.As at
Chancellorsville a year before and on the same battle-ground, a great
captain of the Confederacy was shot down by his own men, and by accident,
at the crisis of a battle.Jackson lingered several days after
Chancellorsville, while Longstreet recovered and lived to fight for the
Confederacy till the surrender at Appomattox.General Wadsworth, of
Hancock's corps, was mortally wounded during the day, while making a
daring assault on the Confederate works, at the head of his men.During the afternoon, the Confederate attack upon Hancock's and Burnside's
forces, which constituted nearly half the entire army, was so severe that
the Federal lines began to give way.The combatants swayed back and forth;
the Confederates seized the Federal breastworks repeatedly, only to be
repulsed again and again.Once, the Southern colors were placed on the
Union battlements.A fire in the forest, which had been burning for hours,
and in which, it is estimated, about two hundred of the Federal wounded
perished, was communicated to the timber entrenchments, the heat and smoke
driving into the faces of the men on the Union side, and compelling them
in some places to abandon the works.Hancock made a gallant and heroic
effort to re-form his lines and push the attack, and, as he rode along the
lines, his inspiring presence elicited cheer upon cheer from the men, but
the troops had exhausted their ammunition, the wagons were in the rear,
and as night was approaching, further attack was abandoned.The contest
ended on the lines where it began.Later in the evening consternation swept the Federal camp when heavy
firing was heard in the direction of Sedgwick's corps, on the right.The
report was current that the entire Sixth Corps had been attacked and
broken.What had happened was a surprise attack by the Confederates,
commanded by General John B. Gordon, on Sedgwick's right flank, Generals
Seymour and Shaler with six hundred men being captured.When a message was
received from Sedgwick that the Sixth Corps was safe in an entirely new
line, there was great rejoicing in the Union camp.Thus ended the two days' fighting of the battle of the Wilderness, one of
the greatest struggles in history.It was Grant's first experience in the
East, and his trial measure of arms with his great antagonist, General
Lee.The latter returned to his entrenchments and the Federals remained in
their position.While Grant had been
defeated in his plan to pass around Lee, yet he had made a new record for
the Army of the Potomac, and he was not turned from his purpose of putting
himself between the Army of Northern Virginia and the capital of the
Confederacy.During the two days' engagement, there were ten hours of
actual fighting, with a loss in killed and wounded of about seventeen
thousand Union and nearly twelve thousand Confederates, nearly three
thousand men sacrificed each hour.It is the belief of some military
writers that Lee deliberately chose the Wilderness as a battle-ground, as
it would effectually conceal great inferiority of force, but if this be so
he seems to have come to share the unanimous opinions of the generals of
both sides that its difficulties were unsurmountable, and within his
entrenchments he awaited further attack.The next night, May 7th, Grant's march by the Confederate right flank was
resumed, but only to be blocked again by the dogged determination of the
tenacious antagonist, a few miles beyond, at Spotsylvania.It is not strange that the minds of these two
men moved along the same lines in military strategy, when we remember they
were both military experts of the highest order, and were now working out
the same problem.The results obtained by each are told in the story of
the battle of Spotsylvania.[Illustration: LEE'S MEN]

The faces of the veterans in this photograph of 1864 reflect more forcibly
than volumes of historical essays, the privations and the courage of the
ragged veterans in gray who faced Grant, with Lee as their leader.They
did not know that their struggle had already become unavailing; that no
amount of perseverance and devotion could make headway against the
resources, determination, and discipline of the Northern armies, now that
they had become concentrated and wielded by a master of men like Grant.But Grant was as yet little more than a name to the armies of the East.His successes had been won on Western fields--Donelson, Vicksburg,
Chattanooga.It was not yet known that the Army of the Potomac under the
new general-in-chief was to prove irresistible.[Illustration: CONFEDERATE SOLDIERS IN VIRGINIA, 1864

captures during May and June, when he sent some ten thousand Confederates
to Coxey's Landing, Virginia, as a result of his first stroke against
Lee--though their arms have been taken from them, though their uniforms
are anything but "uniform," their hats partly the regulation felt of the
Army of Northern Virginia, partly captured Federal caps, and partly
nondescript--yet these ragged veterans stand and sit with the dignity of
accomplishment.To them, "Marse Robert" is still the general
unconquerable, under whom inferior numbers again and again have held their
own, and more; the brilliant leader under whom every man gladly rushes to
any assault, however impossible it seems, knowing that every order will be
made to count.[Illustration: THE COMING OF THE STRANGER GRANT

1864.The day before, in Washington, President Lincoln handed him his
commission, appointing him Lieutenant-General in command of all the
Federal forces.His visit to Washington convinced him of the wisdom of
remaining in the East to direct affairs, and his first interview with
Meade decided him to retain that efficient general in command of the Army
of the Potomac.The two men had known each other but slightly from casual
meetings during the Mexican War."I was a stranger to most of the Army of
the Potomac," said Grant, "but Meade's modesty and willingness to serve in
any capacity impressed me even more than had his victory at Gettysburg."The only prominent officers Grant brought on from the West were Sheridan
and Rawlins.[Illustration: SIGNALING ORDERS FROM GENERAL MEADE'S HEADQUARTERS, JUST
BEFORE THE WILDERNESS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]In April, 1864, General Meade's headquarters lay north of the Rapidan.The
Signal Corps was kept busy transmitting the orders preliminary to the
Wilderness campaign, which was to begin May 5th.The headquarters are
below the brow of the hill.A most important part of the Signal Corps'
duty was the interception and translation of messages interchanged between
the Confederate signal-men.A veteran of Sheridan's army tells of his
impressions as follows: "On the evening of the 18th of October, 1864, the
soldiers of Sheridan's army lay in their lines at Cedar Creek.Our
attention was suddenly directed to the ridge of Massanutten, or Three Top
Mountain, the <DW72> of which covered the left wing of the army--the Eighth
Corps.A lively series of signals was being flashed out from the peak, and
it was evident that messages were being sent both eastward and westward of
the ridge.I can recall now the feeling with which we looked up at those
flashes going over our heads, knowing that they must be Confederate
messages.It was only later that we learned that a keen-eyed Union officer
had been able to read the message: 'To Lieutenant-General Early.Be ready
to move as soon as my forces join you, and we will crush Sheridan.The sturdiness of Sheridan's veterans and
the fresh spirit put into the hearts of the men by the return of Sheridan
himself from 'Winchester, twenty miles away,' a ride rendered immortal by
Read's poem, proved too much at last for the pluck and persistency of
Early's worn-out troops."[Illustration: ON THE WAY TO THE FRONT

the Army of the Potomac awoke to the activity of the spring campaign.One
of the first essentials was to get the vast transport trains in readiness
to cross the Rapidan.Wagons were massed by thousands at Culpeper, near
where Meade's troops had spent the winter.The work of the teamsters was
most arduous; wearied by long night marches--nodding, reins in hand, for
lack of sleep--they might at any moment be suddenly attacked in a bold
attempt to capture or destroy their precious freight.When the
arrangements were completed, each wagon bore the corps badge, division
color, and number of the brigade it was to serve.Its contents were also
designated, together with the branch of the service for which it was
intended.While loaded, the wagons must keep pace with the army movements
whenever possible in order to be parked at night near the brigades to
which they belonged.[Illustration: THE "GRAND CAMPAIGN" UNDER WAY--THE DAY BEFORE THE BATTLE

under Sedgwick and Warren's Fifth Corps began crossing on the morning of
May 4, 1864.The Second Corps, under Hancock, crossed at Ely's Ford,
farther to the east.The cavalry, under Sheridan, was in advance.By night
the army, with the exception of Burnside's Ninth Corps, was south of the
Rapidan, advancing into the Wilderness.The Ninth Corps (a reserve of
twenty thousand men) remained temporarily north of the Rappahannock,
guarding railway communications.On the wooden pontoon-bridge the
rear-guard is crossing while the pontonniers are taking up the canvas
bridge beyond.The movement was magnificently managed; Grant believed it
to be a complete surprise, as Lee had offered no opposition.In the baffling fighting of the Wilderness and Spotsylvania Court
House, Grant was to lose a third of his superior number, arriving a month
later on the James with a dispirited army that had left behind 54,926
comrades in a month.[Illustration: THE TANGLED BATTLEFIELD

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The Edge of the Wilderness, May 5, 1864.Stretching away to the westward
between Grant's army and Lee's lay no-man's-land--the Wilderness.Covered
with a second-growth of thicket, thorny underbrush, and twisted vines, it
was an almost impassable labyrinth, with here and there small clearings in
which stood deserted barns and houses, reached only by unused and
overgrown farm roads.The Federal advance into this region was not a
surprise to Lee, as Grant supposed.The Confederate commander had caused
the region to be carefully surveyed, hoping for the precise opportunity
that Grant was about to give him.At the very outset of the campaign he
could strike the Federals in a position where superior numbers counted
little.If he could drive Grant beyond the Rappahannock--as he had forced
Pope, Burnside and Hooker before him--says George Cary Eggleston (in the
"History of the Confederate War"), "loud and almost irresistible would
have been the cry for an armistice, supported (as it would have been) by
Wall Street and all Europe."[Illustration: WHERE EWELL'S CHARGE SURPRISED GRANT

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]A photograph of Confederate breastworks raised by Ewell's men a few months
before, while they fought in the Wilderness, May 5, 1864.In the picture
we see some of the customary breastworks which both contending armies
threw up to strengthen their positions.These were in a field near the
turnpike in front of Ewell's main line.The impracticable nature of the
ground tore the lines on both sides into fragments; as they swept back and
forth, squads and companies strove fiercely with one another,
hand-to-hand.Grant had confidently expressed the belief to one of his
staff officers that there was no more advance left in Lee's army.He was
surprised to learn on the 5th that Ewell's Corps was marching rapidly down
the Orange turnpike to strike at Sedgwick and Warren, while A. P. Hill,
with Longstreet close behind, was pushing forward on the Orange plank-road
against Hancock.LEE GIVES BLOW FOR BLOW

[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Another view of Ewell's advanced entrenchments--the bark still fresh where
the Confederates had worked with the logs.In the Wilderness, Lee, ever
bold and aggressive, executed one of the most brilliant maneuvers of his
career.His advance was a sudden surprise for Grant, and the manner in
which he gave battle was another.Grant harbored the notion that his
adversary would act on the defensive, and that there would be opportunity
to attack the Army of Northern Virginia only behind strong entrenchments.But in the Wilderness, Lee's veterans, the backbone of the South's
fighting strength, showed again their unquenchable spirit of
aggressiveness.They came forth to meet Grant's men on equal terms in the
thorny thickets.About noon, May 5th, the stillness was broken by the
rattle of musketry and the roar of artillery, which told that Warren had
met with resistance on the turnpike and that the battle had begun.Nearly
a mile were Ewell's men driven back, and then they came magnificently on
again, fighting furiously in the smoke-filled thickets with Warren's now
retreating troops.Sedgwick, coming to the support of Warren, renewed the
conflict.To the southward on the plank road, Getty's division, of the
Sixth Corps, hard pressed by the forces of A. P. Hill, was succored by
Hancock with the Second Corps, and together these commanders achieved what
seemed success.It was brief; Longstreet was close at hand to save the day
for the Confederates.TREES IN THE TRACK OF THE IRON STORM

[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The Wilderness to the north of the Orange turnpike.Over ground like this,
where men had seldom trod before, ebbed and flowed the tide of trampling
thousands on May 5 and 6, 1864.Artillery, of which Grant had a
superabundance, was well-nigh useless, wreaking its impotent fury upon the
defenseless trees.Even the efficacy of musketry fire was hampered.Men
tripping and falling in the tangled underbrush arose bleeding from the
briars to struggle with an adversary whose every movement was impeded
also.The cold steel of the bayonet finished the work which rifles had
begun.In the terrible turmoil of death the hopes of both Grant and Lee
were doomed to disappointment.Lee,
disregarding his own safety, endeavored to rally the disordered ranks of
A. P. Hill, and could only be persuaded to retire by the pledge of
Longstreet that his advancing force would win the coveted victory.Falling
upon Hancock's flank, the fresh troops seemed about to crush the Second
Corps, as Jackson's men had crushed the Eleventh the previous year at
Chancellorsville.But now, as Jackson, at the critical moment, had fallen
by the fire of his own men, so Longstreet and his staff, galloping along
the plank road, were mistaken by their own soldiers for Federals and fired
upon.A minie-ball struck Longstreet in the shoulder, and he was carried
from the field, feebly waving his hat that his men might know that he was
not killed.With him departed from the field the life of the attack.[Illustration: A LOSS IN "EFFECTIVE STRENGTH"--WOUNDED AT FREDERICKSBURG

perished in the horror of a forest fire on the night of May 5th.The
Federals lost many gallant officers, among them the veteran Wadsworth.The
Confederates lost Generals Jenkins and Jones, killed, and suffered a
staggering blow in the disabling of Longstreet.The series of battles of
the Wilderness and Spotsylvania campaigns were more costly to the Federals
than Antietam and Gettysburg combined.[Illustration: ONE OF GRANT'S FIELD-TELEGRAPH STATIONS IN 1864

excellent idea of the difficulties under which telegraphing was done at
the front or on the march.With a tent-fly for shelter and a hard-tack box
for a table, the resourceful operator mounted his "relay," tested his
wire, and brought the commanding general into direct communication with
separated brigades or divisions.The U. S. Military Telegraph Corps,
through its Superintendent of Construction, Dennis Doren, kept Meade and
both wings of his army in communication from the crossing of the Rapidan
in May, 1864, till the siege of Petersburg.Over this field-line Grant
received daily reports from four separate armies, numbering a quarter of a
million men, and replied with daily directions for their operations over
an area of seven hundred and fifty thousand square miles.Though every
corps of Meade's army moved daily, Doren kept them in touch with
headquarters.The field-line was built of seven twisted, rubber-coated
wires which were hastily strung on trees or fences.TELEGRAPHING FOR THE ARMIES

ANDREW CARNEGIE

The man who established the Federal military telegraph system amid the
first horrors of war was to become one of the world's foremost advocates
of peace.As the right hand man of Thomas A. Scott, Assistant Secretary of
War, he came to Washington in '61, and was immediately put in charge of
the field work of reestablishing communication between the Capital and the
North, cut off by the Maryland mobs.A telegraph operator himself, he
inaugurated the system of cipher despatches for the War Department and
secured the trusted operators with whom the service was begun.A young man
of twenty-four at the time, he was one of the last to leave the
battlefield of Bull Run, and his duties of general superintendence over
the network of railroads and telegraph lines made him a witness of war's
cruelties on other fields until he with his chief left the government
service June 1, 1862.THE MILITARY FIELD TELEGRAPH

[Illustration: THE MILITARY TELEGRAPH IN THE FIELD]

"No orders ever had to be given to establish the telegraph."Thus wrote
General Grant in his memoirs."The moment troops were in position to go
into camp, the men would put up their wires."Grant pays a glowing tribute
to "the organization and discipline of this body of brave and intelligent
men."[Illustration: THE ARMY SAVING THE NAVY IN MAY, 1864

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.][Illustration]

Here the army is saving the navy by a brilliant piece of engineering that
prevented the loss of a fleet worth $2,000,000.The Red River expedition
was one of the most humiliating ever undertaken by the Federals.Porter's
fleet, which had so boldly advanced above the falls at Alexandria, was
ordered back, only to find that the river was so low as to imprison twelve
vessels.Lieut.-Colonel Joseph Bailey, acting engineer of the Nineteenth
Corps, obtained permission to build a dam in order to make possible the
passage of the fleet.Begun on April 30, 1864, the work was finished on
the 8th of May, almost entirely by the soldiers, working incessantly day
and night, often up to their necks in water and under the broiling sun.Bailey succeeded in turning the whole current into one channel and the
squadron passed below to safety.Not often have inland lumbermen been the
means of saving a navy.[Illustration: COLONEL JOSEPH BAILEY IN 1864.THE MAN WHO SAVED THE FLEET.]The army engineers laughed at this wide-browed, unassuming man when he
suggested building a dam so as to release Admiral Porter's fleet
imprisoned by low water above the Falls at Alexandria at the close of the
futile Red River expedition in 1864.Bailey had been a lumberman in
Wisconsin and had there gained the practical experience which taught him
that the plan was feasible.He was Acting Chief Engineer of the Nineteenth
Army Corps at this time, and obtained permission to go ahead and build his
dam.In the undertaking he had the approval and earnest support of Admiral
Porter, who refused to consider for a moment the abandonment of any of his
vessels even though the Red River expedition had been ordered to return
and General Banks was chafing at delay and sending messages to Porter that
his troops must be got in motion at once.Bailey pushed on with his work and in eleven days he succeeded in so
raising the water in the channel that all the Federal vessels were able to
pass down below the Falls."Words are inadequate," said Admiral Porter, in
his report, "to express the admiration I feel for the ability of Lieut.This is without doubt the best engineering feat ever
performed.... The highest honors the Government can bestow on Colonel
Bailey can never repay him for the service he has rendered the country."For this achievement Bailey was promoted to colonel, brevetted brigadier
general, voted the thanks of Congress, and presented with a sword and a
purse of $3,000 by the officers of Porter's fleet.He settled in Missouri
after the war and was a formidable enemy of the "Bushwhackers" till he was
shot by them on March 21, 1867.He was born at Salem, Ohio, April 28,
1827.[Illustration: READY FOR HER BAPTISM.COPYRIGHT BY REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]This powerful gunboat, the _Lafayette_, though accompanying Admiral Porter
on the Red River expedition, was not one of those entrapped at Alexandria.Her heavy draft precluded her being taken above the Falls.Here we see her
lying above Vicksburg in the spring of 1863.She and her sister ship, the
_Choctaw_, were side-wheel steamers altered into casemate ironclads with
rams.The _Lafayette_ had the stronger armament, carrying two 11-inch
Dahlgrens forward, four 9-inch guns in the broadside, and two 24-pound
howitzers, with two 100-pound Parrott guns astern.She and the _Choctaw_
were the most important acquisitions to Porter's fleet toward the end of
1862.The _Lafayette_ was built and armed for heavy fighting.She got her
first taste of it on the night of April 16, 1863, when Porter took part of
his fleet past the Vicksburg batteries to support Grant's crossing of the
river in an advance on Vicksburg from below.The Lafayette, with a barge
and a transport lashed to her, held her course with difficulty through the
tornado of shot and shell which poured from the Confederate batteries on
the river front in Vicksburg as soon as the movement was discovered.The
_Lafayette_ stood up to this fiery christening and successfully ran the
gantlet, as did all the other vessels save one transport.She was
commanded during the Red River expedition by Lieutenant-Commander J. P.
Foster.[Illustration: FARRAGUT AT THE PINNACLE OF HIS FAME

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]How formidable was Farragut's undertaking in forcing his way into Mobile
Bay is apparent from these photographs.For wooden vessels to pass Morgan
and Gaines, two of the strongest forts on the coast, was pronounced by
experts most foolhardy.Besides, the channel was planted with torpedoes
that might blow the ships to atoms, and within the bay was the Confederate
ram _Tennessee_, thought to be the most powerful ironclad ever put afloat.In the arrangements for the attack, Farragut's flagship, the _Hartford_,
was placed second, the _Brooklyn_ leading the line of battleships, which
were preceded by four monitors.At a quarter before six, on the morning of
August 5th, the fleet moved.Half an hour later it came within range of
Fort Morgan.The
monitor _Tecumseh_, eager to engage the Confederate ram _Tennessee_ behind
the line of torpedoes, ran straight ahead, struck a torpedo, and in a few
minutes went down with most of the crew.As the monitor sank, the
_Brooklyn_ recoiled.Farragut signaled: "What's the trouble?""Torpedoes,"
was the answer."Go ahead, Captain
Drayton.Finding that the smoke from the guns obstructed the
view from the deck, Farragut ascended to the rigging of the main mast,
where he was in great danger of being struck and of falling to the deck.The captain accordingly ordered a quartermaster to tie him in the shrouds.The _Hartford_, under a full head of steam, rushed over the torpedo ground
far in advance of the fleet.The Confederate
ram, invulnerable to the broadsides of the Union guns, steamed alone for
the ships, while the ramparts of the two forts were crowded with
spectators of the coming conflict.The ironclad monster made straight for
the flagship, attempting to ram it and paying no attention to the fire or
the ramming of the other vessels.Its first effort was unsuccessful, but a
second came near proving fatal.It then became a target for the whole
Union fleet; finally its rudder-chain was shot away and it became
unmanageable; in a few minutes it raised the white flag.No wonder
Americans call Farragut the greatest of naval commanders.[Illustration: WHERE BROADSIDES STRUCK]

New Orleans, was presented by Captain Drayton of the "Hartford" to T. W.
Eastman, U. S. N., whose family has courteously allowed its reproduction
here.Never was exhibited a more superb morale than on the "Hartford" as
she steamed in line to the attack of Fort Morgan at Mobile Bay on the
morning of August 5, 1864.Every man was at his station thinking his own
thoughts in the suspense of that moment.On the quarterdeck stood Captain
Percival Drayton and his staff.Near them was the chief-quartermaster,
John H. Knowles, ready to hoist the signals that would convey Farragut's
orders to the fleet.The admiral himself was in the port main shrouds
twenty-five feet above the deck.All was silence aboard till the
"Hartford" was in easy range of the fort.Then the great broadsides of the
old ship began to take their part in the awful cannonade.During the early
part of the action Captain Drayton, fearing that some damage to the
rigging might pitch Farragut overboard, sent Knowles on his famous
mission."I went up," said the old sailor, "with a piece of lead line and
made it fast to one of the forward shrouds, and then took it around the
admiral to the after shroud, making it fast there.The admiral said,
'Never mind, I'm all right,' but I went ahead and obeyed orders."Later
Farragut, undoing the lashing with his own hands, climbed higher still.[Illustration: QUARTERMASTER KNOWLES]


[Illustration: FORT MORGAN--A BOMBARDMENT BRAVELY ANSWERED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The battered walls of Fort Morgan, in 1864, tell of a terrific smashing by
the Federal navy.But the gallant Confederates returned the blows with
amazing courage and skill; the rapidity and accuracy of their fire was
rarely equalled in the war.In the terrible conflict the "Hartford" was
struck twenty times, the "Brooklyn" thirty, the "Octorora" seventeen, the
"Metacomet" eleven, the "Lackawanna" five, the "Ossipee" four, the
"Monongahela" five, the "Kennebec" two, and the "Galena" seven.Of the
monitors the "Chickasaw" was struck three times, the "Manhattan" nine, and
the "Winnebago" nineteen.The total loss in the Federal fleet was 52
killed and 170 wounded, while on the Confederate gunboats 12 were killed
and 20 wounded.The night after the battle the "Metacomet" was turned into
a hospital ship and the wounded of both sides were taken to Pensacola.The
pilot of the captured "Tennessee" guided the Federal ship through the
torpedoes, and as she was leaving Pensacola on her return trip Midshipman
Carter of the "Tennessee," who also was on the "Metacomet," called out
from the wharf: "Don't attempt to fire No.2 gun (of the "Tennessee"), as
there is a shell jammed in the bore, and the gun will burst and kill some
one."[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.][Illustration: THE BRAVEST OF THE BRAVE--THE CONFEDERATE IRONCLAD RAM
"TENNESSEE"

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Mobile Bay, on the morning of August 5, 1864, was the arena of more
conspicuous heroism than marked any naval battle-ground of the entire war.Among all the daring deeds of that day stands out superlatively the
gallant manner in which Admiral Franklin Buchanan, C. S. N., fought his
vessel, the "Tennessee.""You shall not have it to say when you leave this
vessel that you were not near enough to the enemy, for I will meet them,
and then you can fight them alongside of their own ships; and if I fall,
lay me on one side and go on with the fight."Thus Buchanan addressed his
men, and then, taking his station in the pilot-house, he took his vessel
into action.The Federal fleet carried more power for destruction than the
combined English, French, and Spanish fleets at Trafalgar, and yet
Buchanan made good his boast that he would fight alongside.No sooner had
Farragut crossed the torpedoes than Buchanan matched that deed, running
through the entire line of Federal vessels, braving their broadsides, and
coming to close quarters with most of them.Then the "Tennessee" ran under
the guns of Fort Morgan for a breathing space.In half an hour she was
steaming up the bay to fight the entire squadron single-handed.Such
boldness was scarce believable, for Buchanan had now not alone wooden
ships to contend with, as when in the "Merrimac" he had dismayed the
Federals in Hampton Roads.Three powerful monitors were to oppose him at
point-blank range.For nearly an hour the gunners in the "Tennessee"
fought, breathing powder-smoke amid an atmosphere superheated to 120
degrees.Buchanan was serving a gun himself when he was wounded and
carried to the surgeon's table below.Captain Johnston fought on for
another twenty minutes, and then the "Tennessee," with her rudder and
engines useless and unable to fire a gun, was surrendered, after a
reluctant consent had been wrung from Buchanan, as he lay on the operating
table.[Illustration]

THE BATTLE OF SPOTSYLVANIA COURT HOUSE

    But to Spotsylvania history will accord the palm, I am sure, for
    having furnished an unexampled muzzle-to-muzzle fire; the longest roll
    of incessant, unbroken musketry; the most splendid exhibition of
    individual heroism and personal daring by large numbers, who, standing
    in the freshly spilt blood of their fellows, faced for so long a
    period and at so short a range the flaming rifles as they heralded the
    decrees of death.It was
    exhibited by both armies, and in that hand-to-hand struggle for the
    possession of the breastworks it seemed almost universal.It would be
    commonplace truism to say that such examples will not be lost to the
    Republic.--_General John B. Gordon, C. S. A., in "Reminiscences of the
    Civil War."_


Immediately after the cessation of hostilities on the 6th of May in the
Wilderness, Grant determined to move his army to Spotsylvania Court House,
and to start the wagon trains on the afternoon of the 7th.Grant's object
was, by a flank move, to get between Lee and Richmond.Lee foresaw Grant's
purpose and also moved his cavalry, under Stuart, across the opponent's
path.As an illustration of the exact science of war we see the two great
military leaders racing for position at Spotsylvania Court House.It was
revealed later that Lee had already made preparations on this field a year
before, in anticipation of its being a possible battle-ground.Apprised of the movement of the Federal trains, Lee, with his usual
sagacious foresight, surmised their destination.He therefore ordered
General R. H. Anderson, now in command of Longstreet's corps, to march to
Spotsylvania Court House at three o'clock on the morning of the 8th.But
the smoke and flames from the burning forests that surrounded Anderson's
camp in the Wilderness made the position untenable, and the march was
begun at eleven o'clock on the night of the 7th.This early start proved
of inestimable value to the Confederates.Anderson's right, in the
Wilderness, rested opposite Hancock's left, and the Confederates secured a
more direct line of march to Spotsylvania, several miles shorter than that
of the Federals.The same night General Ewell at the extreme Confederate
left was ordered to follow Anderson at daylight, if he found no large
force in his front.This order was followed out, there being no opposing
troops, and the corps took the longest route of any of Lee's troops.General Ewell found the march exhausting and distressing on account of the
intense heat and dust and smoke from the burning forests.The Federal move toward Spotsylvania Court House was begun after dark on
the 7th.Warren's corps, in the lead, took the Brock road behind Hancock's
position and was followed by Sedgwick, who marched by way of
Chancellorsville.Burnside came next, but he was halted to guard the
trains.Hancock, covering the move, did not start the head of his command
until some time after daylight.When Warren reached Todd's Tavern he found
the Union cavalry under Merritt in conflict with Fitzhugh Lee's division
of Stuart's cavalry.Warren sent Robinson's division ahead; it drove
Fitzhugh Lee back, and, advancing rapidly, met the head of Anderson's
troops.The leading brigades came to the assistance of the cavalry; Warren
was finally repulsed and began entrenching.The Confederates gained
Spotsylvania Court House.Throughout the day there was continual skirmishing between the troops, as
the Northerners attempted to break the line of the Confederates.Every advance of the blue was repulsed.Lee again
blocked the way of Grant's move.The Federal loss during the day had been
about thirteen hundred, while the Confederates lost fewer men than their
opponents.The work of both was now the construction of entrenchments, which
consisted of earthworks sloping to either side, with logs as a parapet,
and between these works and the opposing army were constructed what are
known as abatis, felled trees, with the branches cut off, the sharp ends
projecting toward the approaching forces.Lee's entrenchments were of such character as to increase the efficiency
of his force.They were formed in the shape of a huge V with the apex
flattened, forming a salient angle against the center of the Federal line.The Confederate lines were facing north, northwest, and northeast, the
corps commanded by Anderson on the left, Ewell in the center, and Early on
the right, the latter temporarily replacing A. P. Hill, who was ill.The
Federals confronting them were Burnside on the left, Sedgwick and Warren
in the center, and Hancock on the right.The day of the 9th was spent in placing the lines of troops, with no
fighting except skirmishing and some sharp-shooting.While placing some
field-pieces, General Sedgwick was hit by a sharpshooter's bullet and
instantly killed.He was a man of high character, a most competent
commander, of fearless courage, loved and lamented by the army.General
Horatio G. Wright succeeded to the command of the Sixth Corps.Early on the morning of the 10th, the Confederates discovered that Hancock
had crossed the Po River in front of his position of the day before and
was threatening their rear.Grant had suspected that Lee was about to move
north toward Fredericksburg, and Hancock had been ordered to make a
reconnaissance with a view to attacking and turning the Confederate left.But difficulties stood in the way of Hancock's performance, and before he
had accomplished much, Meade directed him to send two of his divisions to
assist Warren in making an attack on the Southern lines.The Second Corps
started to recross the Po.Before all were over Early made a vigorous
assault on the rear division, which did not escape without heavy loss.In
this engagement the corps lost the first gun in its most honorable career,
a misfortune deeply lamented by every man in the corps, since up to this
moment it had long been the only one in the entire army which could make
the proud claim of never having lost a gun or a color.But the great event of the 10th was the direct assault upon the
Confederate front.Meade had arranged for Hancock to take charge of this,
and the appointed hour was five in the afternoon.But Warren reported
earlier that the opportunity was most favorable, and he was ordered to
start at once.Wearing his full uniform, the leader of the Fifth Corps
advanced at a quarter to four with the greater portion of his troops.The
progress of the valiant Northerners was one of the greatest difficulty,
owing to the dense wood of low cedar-trees through which they had to make
their way.Longstreet's corps behind their entrenchments acknowledged the
advance with very heavy artillery and musket fire.But Warren's troops did
not falter or pause until some had reached the abatis and others the very
crest of the parapet.A few, indeed, were actually killed inside the
works.All, however, who survived the terrible ordeal were finally driven
back with heavy loss.General James C. Rice was mortally wounded.To the left of Warren, General Wright had observed what he believed to be
a vulnerable spot in the Confederate entrenchments.Behind this particular
place was stationed Doles' brigade of Georgia regiments, and Colonel Emory
Upton was ordered to charge Doles with a column of twelve regiments in
four lines.The ceasing of the Federal artillery at six o'clock was the
signal for the charge, and twenty minutes later, as Upton tells us, "at
command, the lines rose, moved noiselessly to the edge of the wood, and
then, with a wild cheer and faces averted, rushed for the works.Through a
terrible front and flank fire the column advanced quickly, gaining the
parapet.Here occurred a deadly hand-to-hand conflict.The enemy, sitting
in their pits with pieces upright, loaded, and with bayonets fixed ready
to impale the first who should leap over, absolutely refused to yield the
ground.The first of our men who tried to surmount the works fell, pierced
through the head by musket-balls.Others, seeing the fate of their
comrades, held their pieces at arm's length and fired downward, while
others, poising their pieces vertically, hurled them down upon their
enemy, pinning them to the ground.... The struggle lasted but a few
seconds.Numbers prevailed, and like a resistless wave, the column poured
over the works, quickly putting _hors de combat_ those who resisted and
sending to the rear those who surrendered.Pressing forward and expanding
to the right and left, the second line of entrenchments, its line of
battle, and a battery fell into our hands.The column of assault had
accomplished its task."The Confederate line had been shattered and an opening made for expected
support.General Mott, on the left, did
not bring his division forward as had been planned and as General Wright
had ordered.The Confederates were reenforced, and Upton could do no more
than hold the captured entrenchments until ordered to retire.He brought
twelve hundred prisoners and several stands of colors back to the Union
lines; but over a thousand of his own men were killed or wounded.For
gallantry displayed in this charge, Colonel Upton was made
brigadier-general.The losses to the Union army in this engagement at Spotsylvania were over
four thousand.The loss to the Confederates was probably two thousand.The two giant antagonists took a
breathing spell.It was on the morning of this date that Grant penned the
sentence, "I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer,"
to his chief of staff, General Halleck.During this time Sheridan, who had brought the cavalry up to a state of
great efficiency, was making an expedition to the vicinity of Richmond.He
had said that if he were permitted to operate independently of the army he
would draw Stuart after him.Grant at once gave the order, and Sheridan
made a detour around Lee's army, engaging and defeating the Confederate
cavalry, which he greatly outnumbered, on the 11th of May, at Yellow
Tavern, where General Stuart, the brilliant commander of the Confederate
cavalry, was mortally wounded.Grant carefully went over the ground and decided upon another attack on
the 12th.About four hundred yards of clear ground lay in front of the
sharp angle, or salient, of Lee's lines.After the battle this point was
known as the "Bloody Angle," and also as "Hell's Hole."Here Hancock was
ordered to make an attack at daybreak on the 12th.Lee had been expecting
a move on the part of Grant.On the evening of the 10th he sent to Ewell
this message: "It will be necessary for you to reestablish your whole line
to-night.... Perhaps Grant will make a night attack, as it was a favorite
amusement of his at Vicksburg."Through rain and mud Hancock's force was gotten into position within a few
hundred yards of the Confederate breastworks.He was now between Burnside
and Wright.At the first approach of dawn the four divisions of the Second
Corps, under Birney, Mott, Barlow, and Gibbon (in reserve) moved
noiselessly to the designated point of attack.Without a shot being fired
they reached the Confederate entrenchments, and struck with fury and
impetuosity a mortal blow at the point where least expected, on the
salient, held by General Edward Johnson of Ewell's corps.The movement of
the Federals was so swift and the surprise so complete, that the
Confederates could make practically no resistance, and were forced to
surrender.The artillery had been withdrawn from the earthworks occupied by Johnson's
troops on the previous night, but developments had led to an order to
have it returned early in the morning.It was approaching as the attack
was made.Before the artillerymen could escape or turn the guns upon the
Federals, every cannon had been captured.General Johnson with almost his
whole division, numbering about three thousand, and General Steuart, were
captured, between twenty and thirty colors, and several thousand stands of
arms were taken.Hancock had already distinguished himself as a leader of
his soldiers, and from his magnificent appearance, noble bearing, and
courage had been called "Hancock the Superb," but this was the most
brilliant of his military achievements.Pressing onward across the first defensive line of the Confederates,
Hancock's men advanced against the second series of trenches, nearly half
a mile beyond.As the Federals pushed through the muddy fields they lost
all formation.The Southerners
were prepared for the attack.A volley poured into the throng of blue, and
General Gordon with his reserve division rushed forward, fighting
desperately to drive the Northerners back.As they did so General Lee rode
up, evidently intending to go forward with Gordon.His horse was seized by
one of the soldiers, and for the second time in the campaign the cry arose
from the ranks, "Lee to the rear!"The beloved commander was led back from
the range of fire, while the men, under the inspiration of his example,
rushed forward in a charge that drove the Federals back until they had
reached the outer line of works.Here they fought stubbornly at deadly
range.Neither side was able to force the other back.But Gordon was not
able to cope with the entire attack.Wright and Warren both sent some of
their divisions to reenforce Hancock, and Lee sent all the assistance
possible to the troops struggling so desperately to restore his line at
the salient.Many vivid and picturesque descriptions of this fighting at the angle have
been written, some by eye-witnesses, others by able historians, but no
printed page, no cold type can convey to the mind the realities of that
terrible conflict.The whole engagement was
practically a hand-to-hand contest.The dead lay beneath the feet of the
living, three and four layers deep.This hitherto quiet spot of earth was
devastated and covered with the slain, weltering in their own blood,
mangled and shattered into scarcely a semblance of human form.Dying men
were crushed by horses and many, buried beneath the mire and mud, still
lived.Some artillery was posted on high ground not far from the apex of
the salient, and an incessant fire was poured into the Confederate works
over the Union lines, while other guns kept up an enfilade of canister
along the west of the salient.The contest from the right of the Sixth to the left of the Second Corps
was kept up throughout the day along the whole line.Repeatedly the
trenches had to be cleared of the dead.An oak tree twenty-two inches in
diameter was cut down by musket-balls.Men leaped upon the breastworks,
firing until shot down.The battle of the "angle" is said to have been the most awful in duration
and intensity in modern times.Battle-line after battle-line, bravely
obeying orders, was annihilated.The entrenchments were shivered and
shattered, trunks of trees carved into split brooms.Sometimes the
contestants came so close together that their muskets met, muzzle to
muzzle, and their flags almost intertwined with each other as they waved
in the breeze.As they fought with the desperation of madmen, the living
would stand on the bodies of the dead to reach over the breastworks with
their weapons of slaughter.Lee hurled his army with unparalleled vigor
against his opponent five times during the day, but each time was
repulsed.Until three o'clock the next morning the slaughter continued,
when the Confederates sank back into their second line of entrenchments,
leaving their opponents where they had stood in the morning.All the
fighting on the 12th was not done at the "Bloody Angle."Burnside on the
left of Hancock engaged Early's troops and was defeated, while on the
other side of the salient Wright succeeded in driving Anderson back.The question has naturally arisen why that "salient" was regarded of such
vital importance as to induce the two chief commanders to force their
armies into such a hand-to-hand contest that must inevitably result in
unparalleled and wholesale slaughter.It was manifest, however, that Grant
had shown generalship in finding the weak point in Lee's line for attack.It was imperative that he hold the gain made by his troops.Lee could ill
afford the loss resistance would entail, but he could not withdraw his
army during the day without disaster.The men on both sides seemed to comprehend the gravity of the situation,
that it was a battle to the death for that little point of entrenchment.Without urging by officers, and sometimes without officers, they fell into
line and fought and bled and died in myriads as though inspired by some
unseen power.Here men rushed to their doom with shouts of courage and
eagerness.The pity of it all was manifested by the shocking scene on that
battlefield the next day.Piles of dead lay around the "Bloody Angle," a
veritable "Hell's Hole" on both sides of the entrenchments, four layers
deep in places, shattered and torn by bullets and hoofs and clubbed
muskets, while beneath the layers of dead, it is said, there could be seen
quivering limbs of those who still lived.General Grant was deeply moved at the terrible loss of life.When he
expressed his regret for the heavy sacrifice of men to General Meade, the
latter replied, "General, we can't do these little tricks without heavy
losses."The total loss to the Union army in killed, wounded, and missing
at Spotsylvania was nearly eighteen thousand.The Confederate losses have
never been positively known, but from the best available sources of
information the number has been placed at not less than nine thousand men.Lee's loss in high officers was very severe, the killed including General
Daniel and General Perrin, while Generals Walker, Ramseur, R. D. Johnston,
and McGowan were severely wounded.In addition to the loss of these
important commanders, Lee was further crippled in efficient commanders by
the capture of Generals Edward Johnson and Steuart.The Union loss in high
officers was light, excepting General Sedgwick on the 9th.General Webb
was wounded, and Colonel <DW53>, of the Second Corps, was killed.Lee's forces had been handled with such consummate skill as to make them
count one almost for two, and there was the spirit of devotion for Lee
among his soldiers which was indeed practically hero-worship.All in all,
he had an army, though shattered and worn, that was almost unconquerable.Grant found that ordinary methods of war, even such as he had experienced
in the West, were not applicable to the Army of Northern Virginia.The
only hope for the Union army was a long-drawn-out process, and with larger
numbers, better kept, and more often relieved, Grant's army would
ultimately make that of Lee's succumb, from sheer exhaustion and
disintegration.The battle was not terminated on the 12th.During the next five days there
was a continuous movement of the Union corps to the east which was met by
a corresponding readjustment of the Confederate lines.After various
maneuvers, Hancock was ordered to the point where the battle was fought on
the 12th, and on the 18th and 19th, the last effort was made to break the
lines of the Confederates.Ewell, however, drove the Federals back and the
next day he had a severe engagement with the Union left wing, while
endeavoring to find out something of Grant's plans.Twelve days of active effort were thus spent in skirmishing, fighting, and
countermarching.In the last two engagements the Union losses were nearly
two thousand, which are included in those before stated.It was decided to
abandon the attempt to dislodge Lee from his entrenchments, and to move
to the North Anna River.On the 20th of May the march was resumed.The men
had suffered great hardships from hunger, exposure, and incessant action,
and many would fall asleep on the line of march.On the day after the start, Hancock crossed the Mattapony River at one
point and Warren at another.Hancock was ordered to take position on the
right bank and, if practicable, to attack the Confederates wherever found.By the 22d, Wright and Burnside came up and the march proceeded.But the
vigilant Lee had again detected the plans of his adversary.Meade's army had barely started in its purpose to turn the Confederates'
flank when the Southern forces were on the way to block the army of the
North.As on the march from the Wilderness to Spotsylvania, Lee's troops
took the shorter route, along main roads, and reached the North Anna ahead
of the Federals.Warren's corps was the first of Meade's army to arrive at
the north bank of the river, which it did on the afternoon of May 23d.Lee
was already on the south bank, but Warren crossed without opposition.No
sooner had he gotten over, however, than he was attacked by the
Confederates and a severe but undecisive engagement followed.The next
morning (the 24th) Hancock and Wright put their troops across at places
some miles apart, and before these two wings of the army could be joined,
Lee made a brilliant stroke by marching in between them, forming a wedge
whose point rested on the bank, opposite the Union center, under Burnside,
which had not yet crossed the river.The Army of the Potomac was now in three badly separated parts.Burnside
could not get over in sufficient strength to reenforce the wings, and all
attempts by the latter to aid him in so doing met with considerable
disaster.The loss in these engagements approximated two thousand on each
side.On the 25th, Sheridan and his cavalry rejoined the army.They had been
gone since the 9th and their raid was most successful.Besides the
decisive victory over the Confederate cavalry at Yellow Tavern, they had
destroyed several depots of supplies, four trains of cars, and many miles
of railroad track.Nearly four hundred Federal prisoners on their way to
Richmond had been rescued from their captors.The dashing cavalrymen had
even carried the first line of work around Richmond, and had made a detour
down the James to communicate with General Butler.Grant was highly
satisfied with Sheridan's performance.It had been of the greatest
assistance to him, as it had drawn off the whole of the Confederate
cavalry, and made the guarding of the wagon trains an easy matter.But here, on the banks of the North Anna, Grant had been completely
checkmated by Lee.He realized this and decided on a new move, although he
still clung to his idea of turning the Confederate right.The Federal
wings were withdrawn to the north side of the river during the night of
May 26th and the whole set in motion for the Pamunkey River at
Hanovertown.Two divisions of Sheridan's cavalry and Warren's corps were
in advance.Lee lost no time in pursuing his great antagonist, but for the
first time the latter was able to hold his lead.Along the Totopotomoy, on
the afternoon of May 28th, infantry and cavalry of both armies met in a
severe engagement in which the strong position of Lee's troops again
foiled Grant's purpose.The Union would have to try at some other point,
and on the 31st Sheridan's cavalry took possession of Cold Harbor.This
was to be the next battle-ground.[Illustration: IN THE AUTUMN OF 1863--GRANT'S CHANGING EXPRESSIONS]

Although secure in his fame as the conqueror of Vicksburg, Grant still has
the greater part of his destiny to fulfil as he faces the camera.Before
him lie the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor, and the slow investment
of Petersburg.This series forms a particularly interesting study in
expression.At the left hand, the face looks almost amused.In the next
the expression is graver, the mouth close set.The third picture looks
plainly obstinate, and in the last the stern fighter might have been
declaring, as in the following spring: "I propose to fight it out on this
line if it takes all summer."The eyes, first unveiled fully in this
fourth view, are the unmistakable index to Grant's stern inflexibility,
once his decision was made.[Illustration: IN THE AUTUMN OF 1864--AFTER THE STRAIN OF THE WILDERNESS
CAMPAIGN]

Here is a furrowed brow above eyes worn by pain.In the pictures of the
previous year the forehead is more smooth, the expression grave yet
confident.Here the expression is that of a man who has won, but won at a
bitter cost.It is the memory of the 50,000 men whom he left in the
Wilderness campaign and at Cold Harbor that has lined this brow, and
closed still tighter this inflexible mouth.Again, as in the series above,
the eyes are not revealed until the last picture.Then again flashes the
determination of a hero.The great general's biographers say that Grant
was a man of sympathy and infinite pity.It was the more difficult for
him, spurred on to the duty by grim necessity, to order forward the lines
in blue that withered, again and again, before the Confederate fire, but
each time weakened the attenuated line which confronted them.[Illustration: MEADE AND SEDGWICK--BEFORE THE ADVANCE THAT BROUGHT

Sedgwick again was jesting--before Spotsylvania Court House.McMahon of
his staff had begged him to avoid passing some artillery exposed to the
Confederate fire, to which Sedgwick had playfully replied, "McMahon, I
would like to know who commands this corps, you or I?"Then he ordered
some infantry before him to shift toward the right.Their movement drew
the fire of the Confederates.The lines were close together; the situation
tense.A sharpshooter's bullet whistled--Sedgwick fell.He was taken to
Meade's headquarters.The Army of the Potomac had lost another corps
commander, and the Union a brilliant and courageous soldier.[Illustration: SPOTSYLVANIA COURT HOUSE

Generals Grant and Meade, with their staffs, had started toward the little
courthouse.As they passed along the Brock Road in the rear of Hancock's
lines, the men broke into loud hurrahs.They saw that the movement was
still to be southward.But chance had caused Lee to choose the same
objective.Misinterpreting Grant's movement as a retreat upon
Fredericksburg, he sent Longstreet's corps, now commanded by Anderson, to
Spotsylvania.Chance again, in the form of a forest fire, drove Anderson
to make, on the night of May 7th, the march from the Wilderness that he
had been ordered to commence on the morning of the 8th.On that day, while
Warren was contending with the forces of Anderson, Lee's whole army was
entrenching on a ridge around Spotsylvania Court House."Accident," says
Grant, "often decides the fate of battle."But this "accident" was one of
Lee's master moves.[Illustration: THE APEX OF THE BATTLEFIELD

all round it; and below, the Confederate entrenchments near that
blood-drenched spot.At a point in these Confederate lines in advance of
the McCool house, the entrenchments had been thrown forward like the
salient of a fort, and the wedge-shaped space within them was destined to
become renowned as the "Bloody Angle."The position was defended by the
famous "Stonewall Division" of the Confederates under command of General
Edward Johnson.It was near the scene of Upton's gallant charge on the
10th.Here at daybreak on May 12th the divisions of the intrepid Barlow
and Birney, sent forward by Hancock, stole a march upon the unsuspecting
Confederates.Leaping over the breastworks the Federals were upon them and
the first of the terrific hand-to-hand conflicts that marked the day
began.It ended in victory for Hancock's men, into whose hands fell 20
cannon, 30 standards and 4,000 prisoners, "the best division in the
Confederate army."[Illustration: CONFEDERATE ENTRENCHMENTS NEAR "BLOODY ANGLE"]

Flushed with success, the Federals pressed on to Lee's second line of
works, where Wilcox's division of the Confederates held them until
reenforcements sent by Lee from Hill and Anderson drove them back.On the
Federal side the Sixth Corps, with Upton's brigade in the advance, was
hurried forward to hold the advantage gained.But Lee himself was on the
scene, and the men of the gallant Gordon's division, pausing long enough
to seize and turn his horse, with shouts of "General Lee in the rear,"
hurtled forward into the conflict.In five separate charges by the
Confederates the fighting came to close quarters.With bayonets, clubbed
muskets, swords and pistols, men fought within two feet of one another on
either side of the entrenchments at "Bloody Angle" till night at last left
it in possession of the Federals.None of the fighting near Spotsylvania
Court House was inglorious.On the 10th, after a day of strengthening
positions on both sides, young Colonel Emory Upton of the 121st New York,
led a storming party of twelve regiments into the strongest of the
Confederate entrenchments.For his bravery Grant made him a
brigadier-general on the field.[Illustration: UNION ARTILLERY MASSING FOR THE ADVANCE THAT EWELL'S ATTACK

impending tragedy.In the foreground the officers, servants, and orderlies
of the headquarters mess camp are waiting for the command to strike their
tents, pack the wagons, and move on.But at the very time this photograph
was taken they should have been miles away.Grant had issued orders the
day before that should have set these troops in motion.However, the
Confederate General Ewell had chosen the 18th to make an attack on the
right flank.It not only delayed the departure but forced a change in the
intended positions of the division as they had been contemplated by the
commander-in-chief.Beverly House is where General Warren pitched his
headquarters after Spotsylvania, and the spectator is looking toward the
battlefield that lies beyond the distant woods.After Ewell's attack,
Warren again found himself on the right flank, and at this very moment the
main body of the Federal army is passing in the rear of him.The costly
check at Spotsylvania, with its wonderful display of fighting on both
sides, had in its apparently fruitless results called for the display of
all Grant's gifts as a military leader.It takes but little imagination to
supply color to this photograph; it is full of it--full of the movement
and detail of war also.It is springtime; blossoms have just left the
trees and the whole country is green and smiling, but the earth is scarred
by thousands of trampling feet and hoof-prints.Ugly ditches cross the
landscape; the debris of an army marks its onsweep from one battlefield to
another.[Illustration: THE ONES WHO NEVER CAME BACK

so gallantly on May 18th.There may be some who will turn from this
picture with a shudder of horror, but it is no morbid curiosity that will
cause them to study it closely.If pictures such as this were familiar
everywhere there would soon be an end of war.We can realize money by
seeing it expressed in figures; we can realize distances by miles, but
some things in their true meaning can only be grasped and impressions
formed with the seeing eye.Visualizing only this small item of the awful
cost--the cost beside which money cuts no figure--an idea can be gained of
what war is.Here is a sermon in the cause of universal peace.The
handsome lad lying with outstretched arms and clinched fingers is a mute
plea.Death has not disfigured him--he lies in an attitude of relaxation
and composure.Perhaps in some Southern home this same face is pictured in
the old family album, alert and full of life and hope, and here is the
end.Does there not come to the mind the insistent question, "Why?"The
Federal soldiers standing in the picture are not thinking of all this, it
may be true, but had they meditated in the way that some may, as they gaze
at this record of death, it would be worth their while.One of the men is
apparently holding a sprig of blossoms in his hand.[Illustration: IN ONE LONG BURIAL TRENCH

bitterness exists in moments such as these.What soldier in the party
knows but what it may be his turn next to lie beside other lumps of clay
and join his earth-mother in this same fashion in his turn.But men become
used to work of any kind, and these men digging up the warm spring soil,
when their labor is concluded, are neither oppressed nor nerve-shattered
by what they have seen and done.They have lost the power of experiencing
sensation.Senses become numbed in a measure; the value of life itself
from close and constant association with death is minimized almost to the
vanishing point.In half an hour these very men may be singing and
laughing as if war and death were only things to be expected, not reasoned
over in the least.[Illustration: ONE OF THE FEARLESS CONFEDERATES]

artillery and an enfilading fire from rifle-pits across the river.Late in
the evening of the 23d, Hancock's corps, arriving before the redoubt, had
assaulted it with two brigades and easily carried it.During the night the
Confederates from the other side made two attacks upon the bridge and
finally succeeded in setting it afire.The flames were extinguished by the
Federals, and on the 24th Hancock's troops crossed over without
opposition.The easy crossing of the Federals here was but another example
of Lee's favorite rule to let his antagonist attack him on the further
side of a stream.Taylor's Bridge could easily have been held by Lee for a
much longer time, but its ready abandonment was part of the tactics by
which Grant was being led into a military dilemma.In the picture the
Federal soldiers confidently hold the captured redoubt, convinced that the
possession of it meant that they had driven Lee to his last corner.[Illustration: "WALK YOUR HORSES"

entrenchments, showing in the foreground, were seized by the old "Berry

their colors to the middle of the bridge, driving off the Confederates
before they could destroy it.When the Federals began crossing next day
they had to run the gantlet of musketry and artillery fire from the
opposite bank.Several regiments of New York heavy artillery poured across
the structure at the double-quick with the hostile shells bursting about
their heads.When Captain Sleeper's Eighteenth Massachusetts battery began
crossing, the Confederate cannoneers redoubled their efforts to blow up
the ammunition by well-aimed shots.Sleeper passed over only one piece at
a time in order to diminish the target and enforce the observance of the
local law by walking his horses!The Second Corps got no further than the
ridge beyond, where Lee's strong V formation held it from further
advance.[Illustration: A SANITARY-COMMISSION NURSE AND HER PATIENTS AT

crutches, which did not form part of the regular medical corps
paraphernalia.The effect of their work can be seen here, and also the

the war practically fell under three headings: incised and punctured
wounds, comprising saber cuts, bayonet stabs, and sword thrusts;
miscellaneous, from falls, blows from blunt weapons, and various
accidents; lastly, and chiefly, gunshot wounds.The war came prior to the
demonstration of the fact that the causes of disease and suppurative
conditions are living organisms of microscopic size.Septicemia,
erysipelas, lockjaw, and gangrene were variously attributed to dampness
and a multitude of other conditions.[Illustration: A CHANGE OF BASE--THE CAVALRY SCREEN

Rappahannock, May 30, 1864.After the reverse to the Union arms at
Spottsylvania, Grant ordered the change of base from the Rappahannock to
McClellan's former starting-point, White House on the Pamunkey.The
control of the waterways, combined with Sheridan's efficient use of the
cavalry, made this an easy matter.Torbert's division encountered Gordon's
brigade of Confederate cavalry at Hanovertown and drove it in the
direction of Hanover Court House.Gregg's division moved up to this line;
Russell's division of infantry encamped near the river-crossing in
support, and behind the mask thus formed the Army of the Potomac crossed
the Pamunkey on May 28th unimpeded.Gregg was then ordered to reconnoiter
towards Mechanicsville, and after a severe fight at Hawes' shop he
succeeded (with the assistance of Custer's brigade) in driving Hampton's
and Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry divisions and Butler's brigade from the field.Although the battle took place immediately in front of the Federal
infantry, General Meade declined to put the latter into action, and the
battle was won by the cavalry alone.COLD HARBOR

    Cold Harbor is, I think, the only battle I ever fought that I would
    not fight over again under the circumstances.I have always regretted
    that the last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made.--_General U. S.
    Grant in his "Memoirs."_


According to Grant's well-made plans of march, the various corps of the
Army of the Potomac set out from the banks of the North Anna on the night
of May 26, 1864, at the times and by the routes assigned to them.Early on
the morning of May 27th Lee set his force in motion by the Telegraph road
and such others as were available, across the Little and South Anna rivers
toward Ashland and Atlee's Station on the Virginia Central Railroad.Thus the armies were stretched like two live wires along the swampy
bottom-lands of eastern Virginia, and as they came in contact, here and
there along the line, there were the inevitable sputterings of flame and
considerable destruction wrought.The advance Federal infantry crossed the
Pamunkey, after the cavalry, at Hanoverstown, early on May 28th.The
Second Corps was close behind the Sixth; the Fifth was over by noon, while
the Ninth, now an integral portion of the Army of the Potomac, passed the
river by midnight.On the 31st General Sheridan reached Cold Harbor, which Meade had ordered
him to hold at all hazards.This place, probably named after the old home
of some English settler, was not a town but the meeting-place of several
roads of great strategic importance to the Federal army.They led not only
toward Richmond by the way of the upper Chickahominy bridges, but in the
direction of White House Landing, on the Pamunkey River.Both Lee and Meade had received reenforcements--the former by
Breckinridge, and the scattered forces in western Virginia, and by Pickett
and Hoke from North Carolina.From Bermuda Hundred where General Butler
was "bottled up"--to use a phrase which Grant employed and afterward
regretted--General W. F. Smith was ordered to bring the Eighteenth Corps
of the Army of the James to the assistance of Meade, since Butler could
defend his position perfectly well with a small force, and could make no
headway against Beauregard with a large one.Grant had now nearly one
hundred and fourteen thousand troops and Lee about eighty thousand.Sheridan's appearance at Cold Harbor was resented in vain by Fitzhugh Lee,
and the next morning, June 1st, the Sixth Corps arrived, followed by
General Smith and ten thousand men of the Eighteenth, who had hastened
from the landing-place at White House.These took position on the right of
the Sixth, and the Federal line was promptly faced by Longstreet's corps,
a part of A. P. Hill's, and the divisions of Hoke and Breckinridge.At six
o'clock in the afternoon Wright and Smith advanced to the attack, which
Hoke and Kershaw received with courage and determination.The Confederate
line was broken in several places, but before night checked the struggle
the Southerners had in some degree regained their position.The short
contest was a severe one for the Federal side.Wright lost about twelve
hundred men and Smith one thousand.The following day the final dispositions were made for the mighty struggle
that would decide Grant's last chance to interpose between Lee and
Richmond.Hancock and the Second Corps arrived at Cold Harbor and took
position on the left of General Wright.Burnside, with the Ninth Corps,
was placed near Bethesda Church on the road to Mechanicsville, while
Warren, with the Fifth, came to his left and connected with Smith's right.Sheridan was sent to hold the lower Chickahominy bridges and to cover the
road to White House, which was now the base of supplies.On the Southern
side Ewell's corps, now commanded by General Early, faced Burnside's and
Warren's.Longstreet's corps, still under Anderson, was opposite Wright
and Smith, while A. P. Hill, on the extreme right, confronted Hancock.There was sharp fighting during the entire day, but Early did not succeed
in getting upon the Federal right flank, as he attempted to do.Both armies lay very close to each other and were well entrenched.Lee was
naturally strong on his right, and his left was difficult of access, since
it must be approached through wooded swamps.Well-placed batteries made
artillery fire from front and both flanks possible, but Grant decided to
attack the whole Confederate front, and word was sent to the corps
commanders to assault at half-past four the following morning.The hot sultry weather of the preceding days had brought much suffering.The movement of troops and wagons raised clouds of dust which settled down
upon the sweltering men and beasts.But five o'clock on the afternoon of
June 2d brought the grateful rain, and this continued during the night,
giving great relief to the exhausted troops.At the hour designated the Federal lines moved promptly from their shallow
rifle-pits toward the Confederate works.The main assault was made by the
Second, Sixth, and Eighteenth corps.With determined and firm step they
started to cross the space between the opposing entrenchments.The silence
of the dawning summer morning was broken by the screams of musket-ball and
canister and shell.That move of the Federal battle-line opened the fiery
furnace across the intervening space, which was, in the next instant, a
Vesuvius, pouring tons and tons of steel and lead into the moving human
mass.From front, from right and left, artillery crashed and swept the
field, musketry and grape hewed and mangled and mowed down the line of
blue as it moved on its approach.Meade issued orders for the suspension of all further offensive
operations.A word remains to be said as to fortunes of Burnside's and Warren's
forces, which were on the Federal right.Generals Potter and Willcox of
the Ninth Corps made a quick capture of Early's advanced rifle-pits and
were waiting for the order to advance on his main entrenchments, when the
order of suspension arrived.Early fell upon him later in the day but was
repulsed.Warren, on the left of Burnside, drove Rodes' division back and
repulsed Gordon's brigade, which had attacked him.The commander of the
Fifth Corps reported that his line was too extended for further operations
and Birney's division was sent from the Second Corps to his left.But by
the time this got into position the battle of Cold Harbor was practically
over.The losses to the Federal army in this battle and the engagements which
preceded it were over seventeen thousand, while the Confederate loss did
not exceed one-fifth of that number.Grant had failed in his plan to
destroy Lee north of the James River, and saw that he must now cross it.Thirty days had passed in the campaign since the Wilderness and the grand
total in losses to Grant's army in killed, wounded, and missing was
54,929.The losses in Lee's army were never accurately given, but they
were very much less in proportion to the numerical strength of the two
armies.If Grant had inflicted punishment upon his foe equal to that
suffered by the Federal forces, Lee's army would have been practically
annihilated.The Federal general-in-chief had decided to secure Petersburg and confront
Lee once more.General Gillmore was sent by Butler, with cavalry and
infantry, on June 10th to make the capture, but was unsuccessful.Thereupon General Smith and the Eighteenth Corps were despatched to White
House Landing to go forward by water and reach Petersburg before Lee had
time to reenforce it.[Illustration: READY FOR THE ADVANCE THAT LEE DROVE BACK

wings of the Army of the Potomac.But when the center under Burnside was
driven back and severely handled at Ox Ford, Grant immediately detached a
brigade each from Hancock and Warren to attack the apex of Lee's wedge on
the south bank of the river, but the position was too strong to justify
the attempt.Then it dawned upon the Federal general-in-chief that Lee had
cleaved the Army of the Potomac into two separated bodies.To reenforce
either wing would require two crossings of the river, while Lee could
quickly march troops from one side to the other within his impregnable
wedge.As Grant put it in his report, "To make a direct attack from either
wing would cause a slaughter of our men that even success would not
justify."[Illustration: IMPROVISED BREASTWORKS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The End of the Gray Line at Cold Harbor.Here at the extreme left of the
Confederate lines at Cold Harbor is an example of the crude protection
resorted to by the soldiers on both sides in advance or retreat.A
momentary lull in the battle was invariably employed in strengthening each
position.Trees were felled under fire, and fence rails gathered quickly
were piled up to make possible another stand.The space between the lines
at Cold Harbor was so narrow at many points as to resemble a road,
encumbered with the dead and wounded.This extraordinary proximity induced
a nervous alertness which made the troops peculiarly sensitive to night
alarms; even small parties searching quietly for wounded comrades might
begin a panic.A few scattering shots were often enough to start a heavy
and continuous musketry fire and a roar of artillery along the entire
line.It was a favorite ruse of the Federal soldiers to aim their muskets
carefully to clear the top of the Confederate breastworks and then set up
a great shout.The Confederates, deceived into the belief that an attack
was coming, would spring up and expose themselves to the well-directed
volley which thinned their ranks.COLD HARBOR

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The battle of Cold Harbor on June 3d was the third tremendous engagement
of Grant's campaign against Richmond within a month.It was also his
costliest onset on Lee's veteran army.Grant had risked much in his change
of base to the James in order to bring him nearer to Richmond and to the
friendly hand which Butler with the Army of the James was in a position to
reach out to him.Lee had again confronted him, entrenching himself but
six miles from the outworks of Richmond, while the Chickahominy cut off
any further flanking movement.There was nothing to do but fight it out,
and Grant ordered an attack all along the line.On June 3d he hurled the
Army of the Potomac against the inferior numbers of Lee, and in a brave
assault upon the Confederate entrenchments, lost ten thousand men in
twenty minutes.[Illustration: FEDERAL CAMP AT COLD HARBOR AFTER THE BATTLE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Grant's assault at Cold Harbor was marked by the gallantry of General
Hancock's division and of the brigades of Gibbon and Barlow, who on the
left of the Federal line charged up the ascent in their front upon the
concentrated artillery of the Confederates; they took the position and
held it for a moment under a galling fire, which finally drove them back,
but not until they had captured a flag and three hundred prisoners.The
battle was substantially over by half-past seven in the morning, but
sullen fighting continued throughout the day.About noontime General
Grant, who had visited all the corps commanders to see for himself the
positions gained and what could be done, concluded that the Confederates
were too strongly entrenched to be dislodged and ordered that further
offensive action should cease.All the next day the dead and wounded lay
on the field uncared for while both armies warily watched each other.The
lower picture was taken during this weary wait.Not till the 7th was a
satisfactory truce arranged, and then all but two of the wounded Federals
had died.No wonder that Grant wrote, "I have always regretted that the
last assault at Cold Harbor was ever made."[Illustration: THE BUSIEST PLACE IN DIXIE

infinite relief that Grant saw the advance of the Army of the Potomac

hazardous one.More than fifty miles intervened between him and Butler by
the roads he would have to travel, and he had to cross both the
Chickahominy and the James, which were unbridged.The paramount difficulty
was to get the Army of the Potomac out of its position before Lee, who
confronted it at Cold Harbor.Lee had the shorter line and better roads to
move over and meet Grant at the Chickahominy, or he might, if he chose,
descend rapidly on Butler and crush him before Grant could unite with him."But," says Grant, "the move had to be made, and I relied upon Lee's not
seeing my danger as I saw it."Near the old Charles City Court House the
crossing of the James was successfully accomplished, and on the 14th Grant
took steamer and ran up the river to Bermuda Hundred to see General Butler
and direct the movement against Petersburg, that began the final
investment of that city.[Illustration: THE MONITOR IN A STORM._Painted by Robert Hopkin._

TO ATLANTA

    Johnston was an officer who, by the common consent of the military men
    of both sides, was reckoned second only to Lee, if second, in the
    qualities which fit an officer for the responsibility of great
    commands.... He practised a lynx-eyed watchfulness of his adversary,
    tempting him constantly to assault his entrenchments, holding his
    fortified positions to the last moment, but choosing that last moment
    so well as to save nearly every gun and wagon in the final withdrawal,
    and always presenting a front covered by such defenses that one man in
    the line was, by all sound military rules, equal to three or four in
    the attack.In this way he constantly neutralized the superiority of
    force his opponent wielded, and made his campaign from Dalton to the
    Chattahoochee a model of defensive warfare.It is Sherman's glory
    that, with a totally different temperament, he accepted his
    adversary's game, and played it with a skill that was finally
    successful, as we shall see.--_Major-General Jacob D. Cox, U. S. V.,
    in "Atlanta."_


The two leading Federal generals of the war, Grant and Sherman, met at
Nashville, Tennessee, on March 17, 1864, and arranged for a great
concerted double movement against the two main Southern armies, the Army
of Northern Virginia and the Army of Tennessee.Grant, who had been made
commander of all the Federal armies, was to take personal charge of the
Army of the Potomac and move against Lee, while to Sherman, whom, at
Grant's request, President Lincoln had placed at the head of the Military
Division of the Mississippi, he turned over the Western army, which was to
proceed against Johnston.It was decided, moreover, that the two movements were to be simultaneous
and that they were to begin early in May.Sherman concentrated his forces
around Chattanooga on the Tennessee River, where the Army of the
Cumberland had spent the winter, and where a decisive battle had been
fought some months before, in the autumn of 1863.His army was composed of
three parts, or, more properly, of three armies operating in concert.These were the Army of the Tennessee, led by General James B. McPherson;
the Army of Ohio, under General John M. Schofield, and the Army of the
Cumberland, commanded by General George H. Thomas.The last named was much
larger than the other two combined.The triple army aggregated the grand
total of ninety-nine thousand men, six thousand of whom were cavalrymen,
while four thousand four hundred and sixty belonged to the artillery.There were two hundred and fifty-four heavy guns.Soon to be pitted against Sherman's army was that of General Joseph E.
Johnston, which had spent the winter at Dalton, in the State of Georgia,
some thirty miles southeast of Chattanooga.It was by chance that Dalton
became the winter quarters of the Confederate army.In the preceding
autumn, when General Bragg had been defeated on Missionary Ridge and
driven from the vicinity of Chattanooga, he retreated to Dalton and
stopped for a night's rest.Discovering the next morning that he was not
pursued, he there remained.Some time later he was superseded by General
Johnston.By telegraph, General Sherman was apprised of the time when Grant was to
move upon Lee on the banks of the Rapidan, in Virginia, and he prepared to
move his own army at the same time.But he was two days behind Grant, who
began his Virginia campaign on May 4th.Sherman broke camp on the 6th and
led his legions across hill and valley, forest and stream, toward the
Confederate stronghold.Nature was all abloom with the opening of a
Southern spring and the soldiers, who had long chafed under their enforced
idleness, now rejoiced at the exhilarating journey before them, though
their mission was to be one of strife and bloodshed.Johnston's army numbered about fifty-three thousand, and was divided into
two corps, under the respective commands of Generals John B. Hood and
William J. Hardee.But General Polk was on his way to join them, and in a
few days Johnston had in the neighborhood of seventy thousand men.His
position at Dalton was too strong to be carried by a front attack, and
Sherman was too wise to attempt it.Leaving Thomas and Schofield to make a
feint at Johnston's front, Sherman sent McPherson on a flanking movement
by the right to occupy Snake Creek Gap, a mountain pass near Resaca, which
is about eighteen miles below Dalton.Sherman, with the main part of the army, soon occupied Tunnel Hill, which
faces Rocky Face Ridge, an eastern range of the Cumberland Mountains,
north of Dalton, on which a large part of Johnston's army was posted.The
Federal leader had little or no hope of dislodging his great antagonist
from this impregnable position, fortified by rocks and cliffs which no
army could scale while under fire.But he ordered that demonstrations be
made at several places, especially at a pass known as Rocky Face Gap.This
was done with great spirit and bravery, the men clambering over rocks and
across ravines in the face of showers of bullets and even of masses of
stone hurled down from the heights above them.On the whole they won but
little advantage.During the 8th and 9th of May, these operations were continued, the
Federals making but little impression on the Confederate stronghold.Meanwhile, on the Dalton road there was a sharp cavalry fight, the Federal
commander, General E. M. McCook, having encountered General Wheeler.McCook's advance brigade under Colonel La Grange was defeated and La
Grange was made prisoner.Sherman's chief object in these demonstrations, it will be seen, was so to
engage Johnston as to prevent his intercepting McPherson in the latter's
movement upon Resaca.In this Sherman was successful, and by the 11th he
was giving his whole energy to moving the remainder of his forces by the
right flank, as McPherson had done, to Resaca, leaving a detachment of
General O. O. Howard's Fourth Corps to occupy Dalton when evacuated.When
Johnston discovered this, he was quick to see that he must abandon his
entrenchments and intercept Sherman.Moving by the only two good roads,
Johnston beat Sherman in the race to Resaca.The town had been fortified,
owing to Johnston's foresight, and McPherson had failed to dislodge the
garrison and capture it.The Confederate army was now settled behind its
entrenchments, occupying a semicircle of low wooded hills, both flanks of
the army resting on the banks of the Oostenaula River.On the morning of May 14th, the Confederate works were invested by the
greater part of Sherman's army and it was evident that a battle was
imminent.The attack was begun about noon, chiefly by the Fourteenth Army
Corps under Palmer, of Thomas' army, and Judah's division of Schofield's.General Hindman's division of Hood's corps bore the brunt of this attack
and there was heavy loss on both sides.Later in the day, a portion of
Hood's corps was massed in a heavy column and hurled against the Federal
left, driving it back.But at this point the Twentieth Army Corps under
Hooker, of Thomas' army, dashed against the advancing Confederates and
pushed them back to their former lines.The forenoon of the next day was spent in heavy skirmishing, which grew to
the dignity of a battle.During the day's operations a hard fight for a
Confederate lunette on the top of a low hill occurred.At length, General
Butterfield, in the face of a galling fire, succeeded in capturing the
position.But so deadly was the fire from Hardee's corps that Butterfield
was unable to hold it or to remove the four guns the lunette contained.With the coming of night, General Johnston determined to withdraw his army
from Resaca.The battle had cost each army nearly three thousand men.While it was in progress, McPherson, sent by Sherman, had deftly marched
around Johnston's left with the view of cutting off his retreat south by
seizing the bridges across the Oostenaula, and at the same time the
Federal cavalry was threatening the railroad to Atlanta which ran beyond
the river.It was the knowledge of these facts that determined the
Confederate commander to abandon Resaca.Withdrawing during the night, he
led his army southward to the banks of the Etowah River.Sherman followed
but a few miles behind him.At the same time Sherman sent a division of
the Army of the Cumberland, under General Jeff.C. Davis, to Rome, at the
junction of the Etowah and the Oostenaula, where there were important
machine-shops and factories.Davis captured the town and several heavy
guns, destroyed the factories, and left a garrison to hold it.Sherman was eager for a battle in the open with Johnston and on the 17th,
near the town of Adairsville, it seemed as if the latter would gratify
him.Johnston chose a good position, posted his cavalry, deployed his
infantry, and awaited combat.The skirmishing
for some hours almost amounted to a battle.But suddenly Johnston decided
to defer a conclusive contest to another time.Again at Cassville, a few days later, Johnston drew up the Confederate
legions in battle array, evidently having decided on a general engagement
at this point.He issued a spirited address to the army: "By your courage
and skill you have repulsed every assault of the enemy.... You will now
turn and march to meet his advancing columns.... I lead you to battle."But, when his right flank had been turned by a Federal attack, and when
two of his corps commanders, Hood and Polk, advised against a general
battle, Johnston again decided on postponement.He retreated in the night
across the Etowah, destroyed the bridges, and took a strong position among
the rugged hills about Allatoona Pass, extending south to Kenesaw
Mountain.Johnston's decision to fight and then not to fight was a cause for
grumbling both on the part of his army and of the inhabitants of the
region through which he was passing.His men were eager to defend their
country, and they could not understand this Fabian policy.They would have
preferred defeat to these repeated retreats with no opportunity to show
what they could do.Johnston, however, was wiser than his critics.The Union army was larger
by far and better equipped than his own, and Sherman was a
master-strategist.His hopes rested on two or three contingencies that he
might catch a portion of Sherman's army separated from the rest; that
Sherman would be so weakened by the necessity of guarding the long line of
railroad to his base of supplies at Chattanooga, Nashville, and even
far-away Louisville, as to make it possible to defeat him in open battle,
or, finally, that Sherman might fall into the trap of making a direct
attack while Johnston was in an impregnable position, and in such a
situation he now was.Not yet, however, was Sherman inclined to fall into such a trap, and when
Johnston took his strong position at and beyond Allatoona Pass, the
Northern commander decided, after resting his army for a few days, to move
toward Atlanta by way of Dallas, southwest of the pass.Rations for a
twenty days' absence from direct railroad communication were issued to the
Federal army.In fact, Sherman's railroad connection with the North was
the one delicate problem of the whole movement.The Confederates had
destroyed the iron way as they moved southward; but the Federal engineers,
following the army, repaired the line and rebuilt the bridges almost as
fast as the army could march.Sherman's movement toward Dallas drew Johnston from the <DW72>s of the
Allatoona Hills.From Kingston, the Federal leader wrote on May 23d, "I am
already within fifty miles of Atlanta."But he was not to enter that city
for many weeks, not before he had measured swords again and again with his
great antagonist.On the 25th of May, the two great armies were facing
each other near New Hope Church, about four miles north of Dallas.Here,
for three or four days, there was almost incessant fighting, though there
was not what might be called a pitched battle.Late in the afternoon of the first day, Hooker made a vicious attack on
Stewart's division of Hood's corps.For two hours the battle raged without
a moment's cessation, Hooker being pressed back with heavy loss.During
those two hours he had held his ground against sixteen field-pieces and
five thousand infantry at close range.The name "Hell Hole" was applied to
this spot by the Union soldiers.On the next day there was considerable skirmishing in different places
along the line that divided the two armies.But the chief labor of the day
was throwing up entrenchments, preparatory to a general engagement.The
country, however, was ill fitted for such a contest.The continuous
succession of hills, covered with primeval forests, presented little
opportunity for two great armies, stretched out almost from Dallas to
Marietta, a distance of about ten miles, to come together simultaneously
at all points.A severe contest occurred on the 27th, near the center of the
battle-lines, between General O. O. Howard on the Federal side and General
Patrick Cleburne on the part of the South.Dense and almost impenetrable
was the undergrowth through which Howard led his troops to make the
attack.The fight was at close range and was fierce and bloody, the
Confederates gaining the greater advantage.The next day Johnston made a terrific attack on the Union right, under
McPherson, near Dallas.But McPherson was well entrenched and the
Confederates were repulsed with a serious loss.In the three or four days'
fighting the Federal loss was probably twenty-four hundred men and the
Confederate somewhat greater.In the early days of June, Sherman took possession of the town of
Allatoona and made it a second base of supplies, after repairing the
railroad bridge across the Etowah River.Johnston swung his left around to
Lost Mountain and his right extended beyond the railroad--a line ten miles
in length and much too long for its numbers.Johnston's army, however, had
been reenforced, and it now numbered about seventy-five thousand men.Sherman, on June 1st, had nearly one hundred and thirteen thousand men and
on the 8th he received the addition of a cavalry brigade and two divisions
of the Seventeenth Corps, under General Frank P. Blair, which had marched
from Alabama.So multifarious were the movements of the two great armies among the hills
and forests of that part of Georgia that it is impossible for us to follow
them all.On the 14th of June, Generals Johnston, Hardee, and Polk rode up
the <DW72> of Pine Mountain to reconnoiter.As they were standing, making
observations, a Federal battery in the distance opened on them and General
Polk was struck in the chest with a Parrot shell.General Polk was greatly beloved, and his death caused a shock to the
whole Confederate army.He was a graduate of West Point; but after being
graduated he took orders in the church and for twenty years before the war
was Episcopal Bishop of Louisiana.At the outbreak of the war he entered
the field and served with distinction to the moment of his death.During the next two weeks there was almost incessant fighting, heavy
skirmishing, sparring for position.It was a wonderful game of military
strategy, played among the hills and mountains and forests by two masters
in the art of war.On June 23d, Sherman wrote, "The whole country is one
vast fort, and Johnston must have full fifty miles of connected
trenches.... Our lines are now in close contact, and the fighting
incessant.... As fast as we gain one position, the enemy has another all
ready."Sherman, conscious of superior strength, was now anxious for a real
battle, a fight to the finish with his antagonist.But Johnston was too
wily to be thus caught.He made no false move on the great chessboard of
war.At length, the impatient Sherman decided to make a general front
attack, even though Johnston, at that moment, was impregnably entrenched
on the <DW72>s of Kenesaw Mountain.This was precisely what the Confederate
commander was hoping for.The desperate battle of Kenesaw Mountain occurred on the 27th of June.In
the early morning hours, the boom of Federal cannon announced the opening
of a bloody day's struggle.It was soon answered by the Confederate
batteries in the entrenchments along the mountain side, and the deafening
roar of the giant conflict reverberated from the surrounding hills.About
nine o'clock the Union infantry advance began.On the left was McPherson,
who sent the Fifteenth Army Corps, led by General John A. Logan, directly
against the mountain.The artillery from the Confederate trenches in front
of Logan cut down his men by hundreds.The Federals charged courageously
and captured the lower works, but failed to take the higher ridges.The chief assault of the day was by the Army of the Cumberland, under
Thomas.Most conspicuous in the attack were the divisions of Newton and
Davis, advancing against General Loring, successor of the lamented Polk.Far up on a ridge at one point, General Cleburne held a line of
breastworks, supported by the flanking fire of artillery.Against this a
vain and costly assault was made.When the word was given to charge, the Federals sprang forward and, in the
face of a deadly hail of musket-balls and shells, they dashed up the
<DW72>, firing as they went.Stunned and bleeding, they were checked again
and again by the withering fire from the mountain <DW72>; but they
re-formed and pressed on with dauntless valor.Some of them reached the
parapets and were instantly shot down, their bodies rolling into the
Confederate trenches among the men who had slain them, or back down the
hill whence they had come.General Harker, leading a charge against
Cleburne, was mortally wounded.His men were swept back by a galling fire,
though many fell with their brave leader.This assault on Kenesaw Mountain cost Sherman three thousand men and won
him nothing.The battle
continued but two and a half hours.It was one of the most recklessly
daring assaults during the whole war period, but did not greatly affect
the final result of the campaign.Under a flag of truce, on the day after the battle, the men of the North
and of the South met on the gory field to bury their dead and to minister
to the wounded.They met as friends for the moment, and not as foes.It
was said that there were instances of father and son, one in blue and the
other in gray, and brothers on opposite sides, meeting one another on the
bloody <DW72>s of Kenesaw.Tennessee and Kentucky had sent thousands of men
to each side in the fratricidal struggle and not infrequently families had
been divided.Three weeks of almost incessant rain fell upon the struggling armies
during this time, rendering their operations disagreeable and
unsatisfactory.The camp equipage, the men's uniforms and accouterments
were thoroughly saturated with rain and mud.Still the warriors of the
North and of the South lived and fought on the <DW72>s of the mountain
range, intent on destroying each other.Sherman was convinced by his drastic repulse at Kenesaw Mountain that
success lay not in attacking his great antagonist in a strong position,
and he resumed his old tactics.He would flank Johnston from Kenesaw as he
had flanked him out of Dalton and Allatoona Pass.He thereupon turned upon
Johnston's line of communication with Atlanta, whence the latter received
his supplies.The movement was successful, and in a few days Kenesaw
Mountain was deserted.Johnston moved to the banks of the Chattahoochee, Sherman following in
the hope of catching him while crossing the river.But the wary
Confederate had again, as at Resaca, prepared entrenchments in advance,
and these were on the north bank of the river.He hastened to them, then
turned on the approaching Federals and defiantly awaited attack.But
Sherman remembered Kenesaw and there was no battle.The feints, the sparring, the flanking movements among the hills and
forests continued day after day.The immediate aim in the early days of
July was to cross the Chattahoochee.On the 8th, Sherman sent Schofield
and McPherson across, ten miles or more above the Confederate position.Sherman's position was by no means reassuring.It is true he had, in the
space of two months, pressed his antagonist back inch by inch for more
than a hundred miles and was now almost within sight of the goal of the
campaign--the city of Atlanta.But the single line of railroad that
connected him with the North and brought supplies from Louisville, five
hundred miles away, for a hundred thousand men and twenty-three thousand
animals, might at any moment be destroyed by Confederate raiders.The necessity of guarding the Western and Atlantic Railroad was an
ever-present concern with Sherman.Forrest and his cavalry force were in
northern Mississippi waiting for him to get far enough on the way to
Atlanta for them to pounce upon the iron way and tear it to ruins.To
prevent this General Samuel D. Sturgis, with eight thousand troops, was
sent from Memphis against Forrest.He met him on the 10th of June near
Guntown, Mississippi, but was sadly beaten and driven back to Memphis, one
hundred miles away.The affair, nevertheless, delayed Forrest in his
operations against the railroad, and meanwhile General Smith's troops
returned to Memphis from the Red River expedition, somewhat late according
to the schedule but eager to join Sherman in the advance on Atlanta.Smith, however, was directed to take the offensive against Forrest, and
with fourteen thousand troops, and in a three days' fight, demoralized him
badly at Tupelo, Mississippi, July 14th-17th.Smith returned to Memphis
and made another start for Sherman, when he was suddenly turned back and
sent to Missouri, where the Confederate General Price was extremely
active, to help Rosecrans.To avoid final defeat and to win the ground he had gained had taxed
Sherman's powers to the last degree and was made possible only through his
superior numbers.Even this degree of success could not be expected to
continue if the railroad to the North should be destroyed.But Sherman
must do more than he had done; he must capture Atlanta, this Richmond of
the far South, with its cannon foundries and its great machine-shops, its
military factories, and extensive army supplies.He must divide the
Confederacy north and south as Grant's capture of Vicksburg had split it
east and west.Sherman must have Atlanta, for political reasons as well as for military
purposes.The country was in the midst of a presidential campaign.The
opposition to Lincoln's reelection was strong, and for many weeks it was
believed on all sides that his defeat was inevitable.At least, the
success of the Union arms in the field was deemed essential to Lincoln's
success at the polls.Grant had made little progress in Virginia and his
terrible repulse at Cold Harbor, in June, had cast a gloom over every
Northern State.Farragut was operating in Mobile Bay; but his success was
still in the future.The eyes of the supporters of the great war-president turned longingly,
expectantly, toward General Sherman and his hundred thousand men before
Atlanta."Do something--something spectacular--save the party and save the
country thereby from permanent disruption!"This was the cry of the
millions, and Sherman understood it.But withal, the capture of the
Georgia city may have been doubtful but for the fact that at the critical
moment the Confederate President made a decision that resulted,
unconsciously, in a decided service to the Union cause.He dismissed
General Johnston and put another in his place, one who was less strategic
and more impulsive.Jefferson Davis did not agree with General Johnston's military judgment,
and he seized on the fact that Johnston had so steadily retreated before
the Northern army as an excuse for his removal.On the 18th of July, Davis
turned the Confederate Army of Tennessee over to General John B. Hood.A
graduate of West Point of the class of 1853, a classmate of McPherson,
Schofield, and Sheridan, Hood had faithfully served the cause of the South
since the opening of the war.He was known as a fighter, and it was
believed that he would change the policy of Johnston to one of open battle
with Sherman's army.Johnston had lost, since the opening of the campaign at Dalton, about
fifteen thousand men, and the army that he now delivered to Hood consisted
of about sixty thousand in all.While Hood was no match for Sherman as a strategist, he was not a
weakling.His policy of aggression, however, was not suited to the
circumstances--to the nature of the country--in view of the fact that
Sherman's army was far stronger than his own.Two days after Hood took command of the Confederate army he offered
battle.Sherman's forces had crossed Peach Tree Creek, a small stream
flowing into the Chattahoochee, but a few miles from Atlanta, and were
approaching the city.They had thrown up slight breastworks, as was their
custom, but were not expecting an attack.Suddenly, however, about four
o'clock in the afternoon of July 20th, an imposing column of Confederates
burst from the woods near the position of the Union right center, under
Thomas.The battle was short,
fierce, and bloody.The Confederates made a gallant assault, but were
pressed back to their entrenchments, leaving the ground covered with dead
and wounded.The Federal loss in the battle of Peach Tree Creek was
placed at over seventeen hundred, the Confederate loss being much greater.This battle had been planned by Johnston before his removal, but he had
been waiting for the strategic moment to fight it.Two days later, July 22d, occurred the greatest engagement of the entire
campaign--the battle of Atlanta.The Federal army was closing in on the
entrenchments of Atlanta, and was now within two or three miles of the
city.On the night of the 21st, General Blair, of McPherson's army, had
gained possession of a high hill on the left, which commanded a view of
the heart of the city.Hood thereupon planned to recapture this hill, and
make a general attack on the morning of the 22d.He sent General Hardee on
a long night march around the extreme flank of McPherson's army, the
attack to be made at daybreak.Meantime, General Cheatham, who had
succeeded to the command of Hood's former corps, and General A. P.
Stewart, who now had Polk's corps, were to engage Thomas and Schofield in
front and thus prevent them from sending aid to McPherson.Hardee was delayed in his fifteen-mile night march, and it was noon before
he attacked.At about that hour Generals Sherman and McPherson sat talking
near the Howard house, which was the Federal headquarters, when the sudden
boom of artillery from beyond the hill that Blair had captured announced
the opening of the coming battle.McPherson quickly leaped upon his horse
and galloped away toward the sound of the guns.Meeting Logan and Blair
near the railroad, he conferred with them for a moment, when they
separated, and each hastened to his place in the battle-line.McPherson
sent aides and orderlies in various directions with despatches, until but
two were still with him.He then rode into a forest and was suddenly
confronted by a portion of the Confederate army under General Cheatham."Surrender," was the call that rang out.But he wheeled his horse as if to
flee, when he was instantly shot dead, and the horse galloped back
riderless.The death of the brilliant, dashing young leader, James B. McPherson, was
a great blow to the Union army.But thirty-six years of age, one of the
most promising men in the country, and already the commander of a military
department, McPherson was the only man in all the Western armies whom
Grant, on going to the East, placed in the same military class with
Sherman.Logan succeeded the fallen commander, and the battle raged on.The
Confederates were gaining headway.Cheatham
was pressing on, pouring volley after volley into the ranks of the Army of
the Tennessee, which seemed about to be cut in twain.General Sherman was present and saw
the danger.Calling for Schofield to send several batteries, he placed
them and poured a concentrated artillery fire through the gap and mowed
down the advancing men in swaths.At the same time, Logan pressed forward
and Schofield's infantry was called up.The Confederates were hurled back
with great loss.The shadows of night fell--and the battle of Atlanta was
over.Hood's losses exceeded eight thousand of his brave men, whom he
could ill spare.The Confederate army recuperated within the defenses of Atlanta--behind an
almost impregnable barricade.Sherman had no hope of carrying the city by
assault, while to surround and invest it was impossible with his numbers.He determined, therefore, to strike Hood's lines of supplies.On July
28th, Hood again sent Hardee out from his entrenchments to attack the Army
of the Tennessee, now under the command of General Howard.A fierce battle
at Ezra Church on the west side of the city ensued, and again the
Confederates were defeated with heavy loss.A month passed and Sherman had made little progress toward capturing
Atlanta.Two cavalry raids which he organized resulted in defeat, but the
two railroads from the south into Atlanta were considerably damaged.But,
late in August, the Northern commander made a daring move that proved
successful.Leaving his base of supplies, as Grant had done before
Vicksburg, and marching toward Jonesboro, Sherman destroyed the Macon and
Western Railroad, the only remaining line of supplies to the Confederate
army.Hood attempted to block the march on Jonesboro, and Hardee was sent with
his and S. D. Lee's Corps to attack the Federals, while he himself sought
an opportunity to move upon Sherman's right flank.Hardee's attack failed,
and this necessitated the evacuation of Atlanta.After blowing up his
magazines and destroying the supplies which his men could not carry with
them, Hood abandoned the city, and the next day, September 2d, General
Slocum, having succeeded Hooker, led the Twentieth Corps of the Federal
army within its earthen walls.Hood had made his escape, saving his army
from capture.His chief desire would have been to march directly north on
Marietta and destroy the depots of Federal supplies, but a matter of more
importance prevented.Thirty-four thousand Union prisoners were confined
at Andersonville, and a small body of cavalry could have released them.So
Hood placed himself between Andersonville and Sherman.In the early days of September the Federal hosts occupied the city toward
which they had toiled all the summer long.At East Point, Atlanta, and
Decatur, the three armies settled for a brief rest, while the cavalry,
stretched for many miles along the Chattahoochee, protected their flanks
and rear.Since May their ranks had been depleted by some twenty-eight
thousand killed and wounded, while nearly four thousand had fallen
prisoners, into the Confederates' hands.It was a great price, but whatever else the capture of Atlanta did, it
ensured the reelection of Abraham Lincoln to the presidency of the United
States.The total Confederate losses were in the neighborhood of
thirty-five thousand, of which thirteen thousand were prisoners.[Illustration: SHERMAN IN 1865

fighting was over.To Joseph E. Johnston he offered most liberal terms of
surrender for the Southern armies.Their acceptance would have gone far to
prevent the worst of the reconstruction enormities.Unfortunately his
first convention with Johnston was disapproved.The death of Lincoln had
removed the guiding hand that would have meant so much to the nation.To
those who have read his published correspondence and his memoirs Sherman
appears in a very human light.He was fluent and frequently reckless in
speech and writing, but his kindly humanity is seen in both.[Illustration: BUZZARD'S ROOST, GEORGIA, MAY 7, 1864]

In the upper picture rises the precipitous height of Rocky Face as Sherman
saw it on May 7, 1864.His troops under Thomas had moved forward along the
line of the railroad, opening the great Atlanta campaign on schedule time.Looking down into the gorge called Buzzard's Roost, through which the
railroad passes, Sherman could see swarms of Confederate troops, the road
filled with obstructions, and hostile batteries crowning the cliffs on
either side.He knew that his antagonist, Joe Johnston, here confronted
him in force.But it was to be a campaign of brilliant flanking movements,
and Sherman sat quietly down to wait till the trusty McPherson should
execute the first one.In the lower picture, drawn up on dress parade, stands one of the finest
fighting organizations in the Atlanta campaign.This regiment won its
spurs in the first Union victory in the West at Mill Springs, Kentucky,
January 19, 1862.There, according to the muster-out roll, "William Blake,
musician, threw away his drum and took a gun."The spirit of this drummer
boy of Company F was the spirit of all the troops from Minnesota.A
Georgian noticed an unusually fine body of men marching by, and when told
that they were a Minnesota regiment, said, "I didn't know they had any
troops up there."But the world was to learn the superlative fighting
qualities of the men from the Northwest.Sherman was glad to have all he
could get of them in this great army of one hundred thousand veterans.[Illustration: THE SECOND MINNESOTA INFANTRY--ENGAGED AT ROCKY FACE RIDGE,

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]On the balcony of this little cottage at Graysville, Georgia, stands
General Richard W. Johnson, ready to advance with his cavalry division in
the vanguard of the direct movement upon the Confederates strongly posted
at Dalton.Sherman's cavalry forces under Stoneman and Garrard were not
yet fully equipped and joined the army after the campaign had opened.General Richard W. Johnson's division of Thomas' command, with General
Palmer's division, was given the honor of heading the line of march when
the Federals got in motion on May 5th.The same troops (Palmer's division)
had made the same march in February, sent by Grant to engage Johnston at
Dalton during Sherman's Meridian campaign.Johnson was a West Pointer; he
had gained his cavalry training in the Mexican War, and had fought the
Indians on the Texas border.He distinguished himself at Corinth, and
rapidly rose to the command of a division in Buell's army.Fresh from a
Confederate prison, he joined the Army of the Cumberland in the summer of
1862 to win new laurels at Stone's River, Chickamauga, and Missionary
Ridge.His sabers were conspicuously active in the Atlanta campaign; and
at the battle of New Hope Church on May 28th Johnson himself was wounded,
but recovered in time to join Schofield after the fall of Atlanta and to
assist him in driving Hood and Forrest out of Tennessee.For his bravery
at the battle of Nashville he was brevetted brigadier-general, U. S. A.,
December 16, 1864, and after the war he was retired with the brevet of
major-general.[Illustration: RESACA--FIELD OF THE FIRST HEAVY FIGHTING

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The chips are still bright and the earth fresh turned, in the foreground
where are the Confederate earthworks such at General Joseph E. Johnston
had caused to be thrown up by the <DW64> laborers all along his line of
possible retreat.McPherson, sent by Sherman to strike the railroad in
Johnston's rear, got his head of column through Snake Creek Gap on May
9th, and drove off a Confederate cavalry brigade which retreated toward
Dalton, bringing to Johnston the first news that a heavy force of Federals
was already in his rear.McPherson, within a mile and a half of Resaca,
could have walked into the town with his twenty-three thousand men, but
concluded that the Confederate entrenchments were too strongly held to
assault.When Sherman arrived he found that Johnston, having the shorter
route, was there ahead of him with his entire army strongly posted.On May
15th, "without attempting to assault the fortified works," says Sherman,
"we pressed at all points, and the sound of cannon and musketry rose all
day to the dignity of a battle."Its havoc is seen in the shattered trees
and torn ground in the lower picture.[Illustration: THE WORK OF THE FIRING AT RESACA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.][Illustration: ANOTHER RETROGRADE MOVEMENT OVER THE ETOWAH BRIDGE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]The strong works in the pictures, commanding the railroad bridge over the
Etowah River, were the fourth fortified position to be abandoned by
Johnston within a month.Pursued by Thomas from Resaca, he had made a
brief stand at Kingston and then fallen back steadily and in superb order
into Cassville.There he issued an address to his army announcing his
purpose to retreat no more but to accept battle.His troops were all drawn
up in preparation for a struggle, but that night at supper with Generals
Hood and Polk he was convinced by them that the ground occupied by their
troops was untenable, being enfiladed by the Federal artillery.Johnston,
therefore, gave up his purpose of battle, and on the night of May 20th put
the Etowah River between himself and Sherman and retreated to Allatoona
Pass, shown in the lower picture.[Illustration: ALLATOONA PASS IN THE DISTANCE]

In taking this the camera was planted inside the breastworks seen on the
eminence in the upper picture.Sherman's army now rested after its rapid
advance and waited a few days for the railroad to be repaired in their
rear so that supplies could be brought up.Meanwhile Johnston was being
severely criticized at the South for his continual falling back without
risking a battle.His friends stoutly maintained that it was all
strategic, while some of the Southern newspapers quoted the Federal
General Scott's remark, "Beware of Lee advancing, and watch Johnston at a
stand; for the devil himself would be defeated in the attempt to whip him
retreating."But General Jeff C. Davis, sent by Sherman, took Rome on May
17th and destroyed valuable mills and foundries.Thus began the
accomplishment of one of the main objects of Sherman's march.[Illustration: PINE MOUNTAIN, WHERE POLK, THE FIGHTING BISHOP OF THE
CONFEDERACY, WAS KILLED

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.The blasted pine rears its gaunt height above the mountain <DW72>, covered
with trees slashed down to hold the Federals at bay; and here, on June 14,
1864, the Confederacy lost a commander, a bishop, and a hero.Lieut.-General Leonidas Polk, commanding one of Johnston's army corps,
with Johnston himself and Hardee, another corps commander, was studying
Sherman's position at a tense moment of the latter's advance around Pine
Mountain.The three Confederates stood upon the rolling height, where the
center of Johnston's army awaited the Federal attack.They could see the
columns in blue pushing east of them; the smoke and rattle of musketry as
the pickets were driven in; and the bustle with which the Federal advance
guard felled trees and constructed trenches at their very feet.On the
lonely height the three figures stood conspicuous.A Federal order was
given the artillery to open upon any men in gray who looked like officers
reconnoitering the new position.So, while Hardee was pointing to his
comrade and his chief the danger of one of his divisions which the Federal
advance was cutting off, the bishop-general was struck in the chest by a
cannon shot.Thus the Confederacy lost a leader of unusual influence.Although a bishop of the Episcopal Church, Polk was educated at West
Point.When he threw in his lot with the Confederacy, thousands of his
fellow-Louisianians followed him.A few days before the battle of Pine
Mountain, as he and General Hood were riding together, the bishop was told
by his companion that he had never been received into the communion of a
church and was begged that the rite might be performed.At Hood's headquarters, by the light of a tallow
candle, with a tin basin on the mess table for a baptismal font, and with
Hood's staff present as witnesses, all was ready.Hood, "with a face like
that of an old crusader," stood before the bishop.Crippled by wounds at
Gaines' Mill, Gettysburg, and Chickamauga, he could not kneel, but bent
forward on his crutches.The bishop, in full uniform of the Confederate
army, administered the rite.A few days later, by a strange coincidence,
he was approached by General Johnston on the same errand, and the man whom
Hood was soon to succeed was baptized in the same simple manner.Polk, as
Bishop, had administered his last baptism, and as soldier had fought his
last battle; for Pine Mountain was near.[Illustration: LIEUT.-GEN.LEONIDAS POLK, C. S.[Illustration: IN THE HARDEST FIGHT OF THE CAMPAIGN--THE

speaks of the peculiarly depressing effect that the weather had upon his
troops in the wooded country.Nevertheless he must either assault
Johnston's strong position on the mountain or begin again his flanking
tactics.He decided upon the former, and on June 27th, after three days'
preparation, the assault was made.At nine in the morning along the
Federal lines the furious fire of musketry and artillery was begun, but at
all points the Confederates met it with determined courage and in great
force.McPherson's attacking column, under General Blair, fought its way
up the face of little Kenesaw but could not reach the summit.Then the
courageous troops of Thomas charged up the face of the mountain and
planted their colors on the very parapet of the Confederate works.Here
General Harker, commanding the brigade in which fought the 125th Ohio,
fell mortally wounded, as did Brigadier-General Daniel McCook, and also
General Wagner.[Illustration: FEDERAL ENTRENCHMENTS AT THE FOOT OF KENESAW MOUNTAIN

Atlanta campaign.It took part in the demonstrations against Resaca,

took part in the operations about Marietta and against Kenesaw Mountain in
June and July.The
battery did not go into this campaign without previous experience.It had
already fought as one of the eight batteries at Fort Henry and Fort
Donelson, heard the roar of the battle of Shiloh, and participated in the
sieges of Corinth and Vicksburg.The artillery in the West was not a whit
less necessary to the armies than that in the East.Pope's brilliant feat
of arms in the capture of Island No.10 added to the growing respect in
which the artillery was held by the other arms of the service.The
effective fire of the massed batteries at Murfreesboro turned the tide of
battle.At Chickamauga the Union artillery inflicted fearful losses upon
the Confederates.At Atlanta again they counted their dead by the
hundreds, and at Franklin and Nashville the guns maintained the best
traditions of the Western armies.They played no small part in winning
battles.[Illustration: THOMAS' HEADQUARTERS NEAR MARIETTA DURING THE FIGHTING OF

will reach the Chattahoochee first?There, if anywhere, Johnston must make
his stand; he must hold the fords and ferries, and the fortifications
that, with the wisdom of a far-seeing commander, he has for a long time
been preparing.The rustic work in the photograph, which embowers the
tents of the commanding general and his staff, is the sort of thing that
Civil War soldiers had learned to throw up within an hour after pitching
camp.[Illustration: PALISADES AND _CHEVAUX-DE-FRISE_ GUARDING ATLANTA

keypoints in the Confederate defense, the fort at the head of Marietta
Street, toward which the Federal lines were advancing from the northwest.The old Potter house in the background, once a quiet, handsome country
seat, is now surrounded by bristling fortifications, palisades, and double
lines of _chevaux-de-frise_.Atlanta was engaged in the final grapple with
the force that was to overcome her.Sherman has fought his way past
Kenesaw and across the Chattahoochee, through a country which he describes
as "one vast fort," saying that "Johnston must have at least fifty miles
of connected trenches with abatis and finished batteries."Anticipating
that Sherman might drive him back upon Atlanta, Johnston had constructed,
during the winter, heavily fortified positions all the way from Dalton.During his two months in retreat the fortifications at Atlanta had been
strengthened to the utmost.What he might have done behind them was never
to be known.[Illustration: THE CHATTAHOOCHEE BRIDGE]

"One of the strongest pieces of field fortification I ever saw"--this was
Sherman's characterization of the entrenchments that guarded the railroad
bridge over the Chattahoochee on July 5th.A glimpse of the bridge and the
freshly-turned earth in 1864 is given by the upper picture.At this river
Johnston made his final effort to hold back Sherman from a direct attack
upon Atlanta.If Sherman could get successfully across that river, the
Confederates would be compelled to fall back behind the defenses of the
city, which was the objective of the campaign.Sherman perceived at once
the futility of trying to carry by assault this strongly garrisoned
position.Instead, he made a feint at crossing the river lower down, and
simultaneously went to work in earnest eight miles north of the bridge.The lower picture shows the canvas pontoon boats as perfected by Union
engineers in 1864.A number of these were stealthily set up and launched
by Sherman's Twenty-third Corps near the mouth of Soap Creek, behind a
ridge.Byrd's brigade took the defenders of the southern bank completely
by surprise.It was short work for the Federals to throw pontoon bridges
across and to occupy the coveted spot in force.[Illustration: INFANTRY AND ARTILLERY CROSSING ON BOATS MADE OF PONTOONS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Johnston's parrying of Sherman's mighty strokes was "a model of defensive
warfare," declares one of Sherman's own division commanders, Jacob D. Cox.There was not a man in the Federal army from Sherman down that did not
rejoice to hear that Johnston had been superseded by Hood on July 18th.Johnston, whose mother was a niece of Patrick Henry, was fifty-seven years
old, cold in manner, measured and accurate in speech.His dark firm face,
surmounted by a splendidly intellectual forehead, betokened the
experienced and cautious soldier.His dismissal was one of the political
mistakes which too often hampered capable leaders on both sides.His
Fabian policy in Georgia was precisely the same as that which was winning
fame against heavy odds for Lee in Virginia.[Illustration: GENERAL JOSEPH EGGLESTON JOHNSTON, C. S. A.

The countenance of Hood, on the other hand, indicates an eager, restless
energy, an impetuosity that lacked the poise of Sherman, whose every
gesture showed the alertness of mind and soundness of judgment that in him
were so exactly balanced.Both Schofield and McPherson were classmates of
Hood at West Point, and characterized him to Sherman as "bold even to
rashness and courageous in the extreme."He struck the first offensive
blow at Sherman advancing on Atlanta, and wisely adhered to the plan of
the battle as it had been worked out by Johnston just before his removal.But the policy of attacking was certain to be finally disastrous to the
Confederates.[Illustration: PEACH-TREE CREEK, WHERE HOOD HIT HARD

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Counting these closely clustered Federal graves gives one an idea of the
overwhelming onset with Hood become the aggressor on July 20th.Beyond the
graves are some of the trenches from which the Federals were at first
irresistibly driven.In the background flows Peach-Tree Creek, the little
stream that gives its name to the battlefield.Hood, impatient to
signalize his new responsibility by a stroke that would at once dispel the
gloom at Richmond, had posted his troops behind strongly fortified works
on a ridge commanding the valley of Peach-Tree Creek about five miles to
the north of Atlanta.As the
Federals were disposing their lines and entrenching before this position,
Hood's eager eyes detected a gap in their formation and at four o'clock in
the afternoon hurled a heavy force against it.Thus he proved his
reputation for courage, but the outcome showed the mistake.For a brief
interval Sherman's forces were in great peril.But the Federals under
Newton and Geary rallied and held their ground, till Ward's division in a
brave counter-charge drove the Confederates back.He abandoned his entrenchments that night, leaving on the field
five hundred dead, one thousand wounded, and many prisoners.Sherman
estimated the total Confederate loss at no less than five thousand.That
of the Federals was fifteen hundred.[Illustration: THE ARMY'S FINGER-TIPS--PICKETS BEFORE ATLANTA

shortly before the battle of July 22d.The soldiers are idling about
unconcerned at exposing themselves; this is on the "reserve post."Somewhat in advance of this lay the outer line of pickets, and it would be
time enough to seek cover if they were driven in.Thus armies feel for
each other, stretching out first their sensitive fingers--the pickets.If
these recoil, the skirmishers are sent forward while the strong arm, the
line of battle, gathers itself to meet the foe.As this was an inner line,
it was more strongly fortified than was customary with the pickets.But
the men of both sides had become very expert in improvising field-works at
this stage of the war.Hard campaigning had taught the veterans the
importance to themselves of providing such protection, and no orders had
to be given for their construction.As soon as a regiment gained a
position desirable to hold, the soldiers would throw up a strong parapet
of dirt and logs in a single night.In order to spare the men as much as
possible, Sherman ordered his division commanders to organize pioneer
detachments out of the <DW64>s that escaped to the Federals.[Illustration: THE FINAL BLOW TO THE CONFEDERACY'S SOUTHERN STRONGHOLD

of Atlanta.In the picture the rails heating red-hot amid the flaming
bonfires of the ties, and the piles of twisted debris show vividly what
Sherman meant when he said their "work was done with a will."Sherman saw
that in order to take Atlanta without terrific loss he must cut off all
its rail communications.This he did by "taking the field with our main
force and using it against the communications of Atlanta instead of
against its intrenchments."On the night of August 25th he moved with
practically his entire army and wagon-trains loaded with fifteen days'
rations.By the morning of the 27th the whole front of the city was
deserted.The Confederates concluded that Sherman was in retreat.Next day
they found out their mistake, for the Federal army lay across the West
Point Railroad while the soldiers began wrecking it.Next day they were in
motion toward the railroad to Macon, and General Hood began to understand
that a colossal raid was in progress.After the occupation, when this
picture was taken, Sherman's men completed the work of destruction.[Illustration: THE RUIN OF HOOD'S RETREAT--DEMOLISHED CARS AND

effort to save his communications.About midnight sounds of exploding
shells and what seemed like volleys of musketry arose in the direction of
Atlanta.Supplies and ammunition
that Hood could carry with him were being removed; large quantities of
provisions were being distributed among the citizens, and as the troops
marched out they were allowed to take what they could from the public
stores.The noise that Sherman heard that
night was the blowing up of the rolling-mill and of about a hundred cars
and six engines loaded with Hood's abandoned ammunition.The picture shows

[Illustration]

BLAIR, OF MISSOURI

Although remaining politically neutral throughout the war, Missouri
contributed four hundred and forty-seven separate military organizations
to the Federal armies, and over one hundred to the Confederacy.The Union
sentiment in the State is said to have been due to Frank P. Blair, who,
early in 1861, began organizing home guards.Blair subsequently joined
Grant's command and served with that leader until Sherman took the helm in
the West.With Sherman Major-General Blair fought in Georgia and through
the Carolinas.[Illustration]

BAKER, OF CALIFORNIA

California contributed twelve military organizations to the Federal
forces, but none of them took part in the campaigns east of the
Mississippi.Its Senator, Edward D. Baker, was in his place in Washington
when the war broke out, and, being a close friend of Lincoln, promptly
organized a regiment of Pennsylvanians which was best known by its synonym
"First California."Colonel Baker was killed at the head of it at the
battle of Ball's Bluff, Virginia, October 21, 1861.Baker had been
appointed brigadier-general but declined.[Illustration]

KELLEY, OF WEST VIRGINIA

West Virginia counties had already supplied soldiers for the Confederates
when the new State was organized in 1861.As early as May, 1861, Colonel
B. F. Kelley was in the field with the First West Virginia Infantry
marshalled under the Stars and Stripes.He served to the end of the war
and was brevetted major-general.West Virginia furnished thirty-seven
organizations of all arms to the Federal armies, chiefly for local defense
and for service in contiguous territory.General Kelley was prominent in
the Shenandoah campaigns.[Illustration]

SMYTH, OF DELAWARE

Little Delaware furnished to the Federal armies fifteen separate military
organizations.First in the field was Colonel Thomas A. Smyth, with the
First Delaware Infantry.Early promoted to the command of a brigade, he
led it at Gettysburg, where it received the full force of Pickett's charge
on Cemetery Ridge, July 3, 1863.He was brevetted major-general and fell
at Farmville, on Appomattox River, Va., April 7, 1865, two days before the
surrender at Appomattox.General Smyth was a noted leader in the Second
Corps.[Illustration]

MITCHELL, OF KANSAS

The virgin State of Kansas sent fifty regiments, battalions, and batteries
into the Federal camps.Its Second Infantry was organized and led to the
field by Colonel R. B. Mitchell, a veteran of the Mexican War.At the
first battle in the West, Wilson's Creek, Mo.(August 10, 1861), he was
wounded.At the battle of Perryville, Brigadier-General Mitchell commanded
a division in McCook's Corps and fought desperately to hold the Federal
left flank against a sudden and desperate assault by General Bragg's
Confederates.[Illustration]

CROSS, OF NEW HAMPSHIRE

New Hampshire supplied twenty-nine military organizations to the Federal
armies.To the Granite State belongs the grim distinction of furnishing
the regiment which had the heaviest mortality roll of any infantry
organization in the army.This was the Fifth New Hampshire, commanded by
Colonel E. E. Cross.The Fifth served in the Army of the Potomac.At
Gettysburg, Colonel Cross commanded a brigade, which included the Fifth
New Hampshire, and was killed at the head of it near Devil's Den, on July
2, 1863.LEADERS IN SECURING VOLUNTEERS FOR NORTH AND SOUTH

PEARCE, OF ARKANSAS

Arkansas entered into the war with enthusiasm, and had a large contingent
of Confederate troops ready for the field in the summer of 1861.At
Wilson's Creek, Missouri, August 10, 1861, there were four regiments and
two batteries of Arkansans under command of Brigadier-General N. B.
Pearce.Arkansas furnished seventy separate military organizations to the
Confederate armies and seventeen to the Federals.The State was gallantly
represented in the Army of Northern Virginia, notably at Antietam and
Gettysburg.[Illustration]

STEUART, OF MARYLAND

Maryland quickly responded to the Southern call to arms, and among its
first contribution of soldiers was George H. Steuart, who led a battalion
across the Potomac early in 1861.These Marylanders fought at First Bull
Run, or Manassas, and Lee's army at Petersburg included Maryland troops
under Brigadier-General Steuart.During the war this little border State,
politically neutral, sent six separate organizations to the Confederates
in Virginia, and mustered thirty-five for the Federal camps and for local
defense.[Illustration]

CRITTENDEN, THE CONFEDERATE

Kentucky is notable as a State which sent brothers to both the Federal and
Confederate armies.Major-General George B. Crittenden, C. S. A., was the
brother of Major-General Thomas L. Crittenden, U. S. A. Although remaining
politically neutral throughout the war, the Blue Grass State sent
forty-nine regiments, battalions, and batteries across the border to
uphold the Stars and Bars, and mustered eighty of all arms to battle
around the Stars and Stripes and protect the State from Confederate
incursions.[Illustration]

RANSOM, OF NORTH CAROLINA

The last of the Southern States to cast its fortunes in with the
Confederacy, North Carolina vied with the pioneers in the spirit with
which it entered the war.With the First North Carolina, Lieut.-Col.Matt
W. Ransom was on the firing-line early in 1861.Under his leadership as
brigadier-general, North Carolinians carried the Stars and Bars on all the
great battlefields of the Army of Northern Virginia.The State furnished
ninety organizations for the Confederate armies, and sent eight to the
Federal camps.[Illustration]

FINEGAN, OF FLORIDA

Florida was one of the first to follow South Carolina's example in
dissolving the Federal compact.It furnished twenty-one military
organizations to the Confederate forces, and throughout the war maintained
a vigorous home defense.Its foremost soldier to take the field when the
State was menaced by a strong Federal expedition in February, 1864, was
Brigadier-General Joseph Finegan.Hastily gathering scattered detachments,
he defeated and checked the expedition at the battle of Olustee, or Ocean
Pond, on February 20.[Illustration]

CLEBURNE, OF TENNESSEE

Cleburne was of foreign birth, but before the war was one year old he
became the leader of Tennesseeans, fighting heroically on Tennessee soil.At Shiloh, Cleburne's brigade, and at Murfreesboro, Chattanooga, and
Franklin, Major-General P. R. Cleburne's division found the post of honor.At Franklin this gallant Irishman "The 'Stonewall' Jackson of the West,"
led Tennesseeans for the last time and fell close to the breastworks.Tennessee sent the Confederate armies 129 organizations, and the Federal
fifty-six.[Illustration: THE LAST OF THE FRIGATE._Painted by E. Packbauer._

THE LAST CONFLICTS IN THE SHENANDOAH

    Sheridan's operations were characterized not so much, as has been
    supposed, by any originality of method, as by a just appreciation of
    the proper manner of combining the two arms of infantry and cavalry.He constantly used his powerful body of horse, which under his
    disciplined hand attained a high degree of perfection, as an
    impenetrable mask behind which he screened the execution of maneuvers
    of infantry columns hurled with a mighty momentum on one of the
    enemy's flanks.--_William Swinton, in "Campaigns of the Army of the
    Potomac."_


On July 12, 1864, in the streets of Washington, there could be distinctly
heard the boom of cannon and the sharp firing of musketry.The old specter "threaten Washington," that for
three years had been a standing menace to the Federal authorities and a
"very present help" to the Confederates, now seemed to have come in the
flesh.The hopes of the South and the fears of the North were apparently
about to be realized.The occasion of this demonstration before the very gates of the city was
the result of General Lee's project to relieve the pressure on his own
army, by an invasion of the border States and a threatening attitude
toward the Union capital.The plan had worked well before, and Lee
believed it again would be effective.Grant was pushing him hard in front
of Petersburg.Accordingly, Lee despatched the daring soldier, General
Jubal A. Early, to carry the war again to the northward.He was to go by
the beautiful and fertile Shenandoah valley, that highway of the
Confederates along which the legions of the South had marched and
countermarched.On the 9th of July, the advance lines of the Confederate
force came to the banks of the Monocacy, where they found General Lew
Wallace posted, with eight thousand men, half of Early's numbers, on the
eastern side of that stream, to contest the approach of the Southern
troops.The battle was brief but bloody; the Confederates, crossing the stream and
climbing its slippery banks, hurled their lines of gray against the
compact ranks of blue.The attack was impetuous; the repulse was stubborn.A wail of musketry rent the air and the Northern soldiers fell back to
their second position.Between the opposing forces was a narrow ravine
through which flowed a small brook.Across this stream the tide of battle
rose and fell.Its limpid current was soon crimsoned by the blood of the
dead and wounded.Wallace's columns, as did those of Early, bled, but they
stood.The result of the battle for a time hung in the balance.The retreat began, some of the troops in
order but the greater portion in confusion, and the victorious
Confederates found again an open way to Washington.Now within half a dozen miles of the city, with the dome of the Capitol in
full view, the Southern general pushed his lines so close to Fort Stevens
that he was ready to train his forty pieces of artillery upon its walls.General Augur, in command of the capital's defenses, hastily collected
what strength in men and guns he could.Heavy artillery, militia, sailors
from the navy yard, convalescents, Government employees of all kinds were
rushed to the forts around the city.General Wright, with two divisions of
the Sixth Corps, arrived from the camp at Petersburg, and Emory's division
of the Nineteenth Corps came just in time from New Orleans.This was on
July 11th, the very day on which Early appeared in front of Fort Stevens.The Confederate had determined to make an assault, but the knowledge of
the arrival of Wright and Emory caused him to change his mind.He realized
that, if unsuccessful, his whole force would be lost, and he concluded to
return.Nevertheless, he spent the 12th of July in threatening the city.In the middle of the afternoon General Wright sent out General Wheaton
with Bidwell's brigade of Getty's division, and Early's pickets and
skirmishers were driven back a mile.Pond in "The
Shenandoah Valley" thus describes the scene: "On the parapet of Fort
Stevens stood the tall form of Abraham Lincoln by the side of General
Wright, who in vain warned the eager President that his position was swept
by the bullets of sharpshooters, until an officer was shot down within
three feet of him, when he reluctantly stepped below.Sheltered from the
line of fire, Cabinet officers and a group of citizens and ladies,
breathless with excitement, watched the fortunes of the flight."Under cover of night the Confederates began to retrace their steps and
made their way to the Shenandoah, with General Wright in pursuit.As the
Confederate army was crossing that stream, at Snicker's Ferry, on the
18th, the pursuing Federals came upon them.Early turned, repulsed them,
and continued on his way to Winchester, where General Averell, from
Hunter's forces, now at Harper's Ferry, attacked them with his cavalry and
took several hundred prisoners.The Federal authorities were looking for a "man of the hour"--one whom
they might pit against the able and strategic Early.Such a one was found
in General Philip Henry Sheridan, whom some have called the "Marshal Ney
of America."He was selected by General Grant, and his instructions were
to drive the Confederates out of the Valley once for all.The middle of September found the Confederate forces centered about
Winchester, and the Union army was ten miles distant, with the Opequon
between them.At two o'clock on the morning of September 19th, the Union
camp was in motion, preparing for marching orders.At three o'clock the
forward movement was begun, and by daylight the Federal advance had driven
in the Confederate pickets.Emptying into the Opequon from the west are
two converging streams, forming a triangle with the Winchester and
Martinsburg pike as a base.The town of Winchester is situated on this road, and was therefore at the
bottom of the triangle.Before the town, the Confederate army stretched
its lines between the two streams.The Union army would have to advance
from the apex of the triangle, through a narrow ravine, shut in by thickly
wooded hills and gradually emerging into an undulating valley.At the end
of the gorge was a Confederate outwork, guarding the approach to
Winchester.Both generals had the same plan of battle in mind.Sheridan
would strike the Confederate center and right.Early was willing he should
do this, for he planned to strike the Union right, double it back, get
between Sheridan's army and the gorge, and thus cut off its retreat.It took time for the Union troops to pass through the ravine, and it was
late in the forenoon before the line of battle was formed.The attack and
defense were alike obstinate.Upon the Sixth Corps and Grover's division
of the Nineteenth Corps fell the brunt of the battle, since they were to
hold the center while the Army of West Virginia, under General Crook,
would sweep around them and turn the position of the opposing forces.The
Confederate General Ramseur, with his troops, drove back the Federal
center, held his ground for two hours, while the opposing lines were swept
by musketry and artillery from the front, and enfiladed by artillery.By this time, Russell's division of the Sixth Corps emerged from the
ravine.Forming in two lines, it marched quickly to the front.About the
same time the Confederates were also being reenforced.General Rodes
plunged into the fight, making a gallant attack and losing his life.General Gordon, with his columns of gray, swept across the summit of the
hills and through the murky clouds of smoke saw the steady advance of the
lines of blue.One of Russell's brigades struck the Confederate flank, and
the Federal line was reestablished.As the division moved forward to do
this General Russell fell, pierced through the heart by a piece of shell.The Fifth Maine battery, galloping into the field, unlimbered and with an
enfilading storm of canister aided in turning the tide.Piece by piece the
shattered Union line was picked up and reunited.Early sent the last of
his reserves into the conflict to turn the Union right.Now ensued the
fiercest fighting of the day.Regiment after regiment advanced to the wood
only to be hurled back again.Here it was that the One hundred and
fourteenth New York left its dreadful toll of men.Its position after the
battle could be told by the long, straight line of one hundred and
eighty-five of its dead and wounded.It was three o'clock in the afternoon; the hour of Early's repulse had
struck.To the right of the Union lines could be heard a mighty yell.The
Confederates seemed to redouble their fire.The shivering lightning bolts
shot through the air and the volleys of musketry increased in intensity.Then, across the shell-plowed field, came the reserves under General
Crook.Breasting the Confederate torrent of lead, which cut down nine
hundred of the reserves while crossing the open space, they rushed toward
the embattled lines of the South.At the same moment, coming out of the woods in the rear of the Federals,
were seen the men of the Nineteenth Corps under General Emory, who had for
three hours been lying in the grass awaiting their opportunity.The
Confederate bullets had been falling thick in their midst with fatal
certainty.Rushing into the contest like
madmen, they stopped at nothing.From two sides of the wood the men of
Emory and Crook charged simultaneously.The Union line overlapped the
Confederate at every point and doubled around the unprotected flanks.The
day for the Southerners was irretrievably lost.They fell back toward
Winchester in confusion.As they did so, a great uproar was heard on the
pike road.It was the Federal cavalry under General Torbert sweeping up
the road, driving the Confederate troopers before them.The surprised mass
was pressed into its own lines.The infantry was charged and many
prisoners and battle-flags captured.The sun was now sinking upon the horizon, and on the ascending <DW72>s in
the direction of the town could be seen the long, dark lines of men
following at the heels of the routed army.Along the crest of the
embattled summit galloped a force of cavalrymen, which, falling upon the
disorganized regiments of Early, aided, in the language of Sheridan, "to
send them whirling through Winchester."The Union pursuit continued until
the twilight had come and the shadows of night screened the scattered
forces of Early from the pursuing cavalrymen.The battle of Winchester, or
the Opequon, had been a bloody one--a loss of five thousand on the Federal
side, and about four thousand on the Confederate.By daylight of the following morning the victorious army was again in
pursuit.On the afternoon of that day, it caught up with the Confederates,
who now turned at bay at Fisher's Hill to resist the further approach of
their pursuers.The position selected by General Early was a strong one,
and his antagonist at once recognized it as such.The valley of the
Shenandoah at this point is about four miles wide, lying between Fisher's
Hill and Little North Mountain.General Early's line extended across the
entire valley, and he had greatly increased his already naturally strong
position.From the summit of Three Top
Mountain, his signal corps informed him of every movement of the Union
army in the valley below.General Sheridan's actions indicated a purpose
to assault the center of the Confederate line.For two days he continued
massing his regiments in that direction, at times even skirmishing for
position.General Wright pushed his men to within seven hundred yards of
the Southern battle-line.While this was going on in full view of the
Confederate general and his army, another movement was being executed
which even the vigilant signal officers on Three Top Mountain had not
observed.On the night of September 20th, the troops of General Crook were moved
into the timber on the north bank of Cedar Creek.All during the next day,
they lay concealed.That night they crossed the stream and the next
morning were again hidden by the woods and ravines.At five o'clock on the
morning of the 22d, Crook's men were nearly opposite the Confederate
center.Marching his men in perfect silence, by one o'clock he had arrived
at the left and front of the unsuspecting Early.By four o'clock he had
reached the east face of Little North Mountain, to the left and rear of
the Confederates.While the movement was being made, the main body of the
Federal army was engaging the attention of the Confederates in front.Just
before sundown, Crook's men plunged down the mountain side, from out of
the timbered cover.The Confederates were quick to see that they had been
trapped.They had been caught in a pocket and there was nothing for them
to do except to retreat or surrender.They preferred the former, which
was, according to General Gordon, "first stubborn and slow, then rapid,
then--a rout."After the battle of Fisher's Hill the pursuit still continued.The
Confederate regiments re-formed, and at times would stop and contest the
approach of the advancing cavalrymen.By the time the Union infantry would
reach the place, the retreating army would have vanished.Torbert had been
sent down Luray Valley in pursuit of the Confederate cavalry, with the
hope of scattering it and seizing New Market in time to cut off the
Confederate retreat from Fisher's Hill.But at Milford, in a narrow gorge,
General Wickham held Torbert and prevented the fulfilment of his plan; and
General Early's whole force was able to escape.Day after day this
continued until Early had taken refuge in the Blue Ridge in front of
Brown's Gap.Sheridan in the mean time
had gone into camp at Harrisonburg, and for some time the two armies lay
watching each other.The Federals were having difficulty in holding their
lines of supply.With the Valley practically given up by Early, Sheridan was anxious to
stop here.He wrote to Grant, "I think the best policy will be to let the
burning of the crops in the Valley be the end of the campaign, and let
some of this army go somewhere else."Grant's consent to this plan reached him on October 5th, and the following
day he started on his return march down the Shenandoah.His cavalry
extended across the entire valley.With the unsparing severity of war, his
men began to make a barren waste of the region.The October sky was
overcast with clouds of smoke and sheets of flame from the burning barns
and mills.As the army of Sheridan proceeded down the Valley, the undaunted cavaliers
of Early came in pursuit.His horsemen kept close to the rear of the Union
columns.On the morning of October 9th, the cavalry leader, Rosser, who
had succeeded Wickham, found himself confronted by General Custer's
division, at Tom's Brook.At the same time the Federal general, Wesley
Merritt, fell upon the cavalry of Lomax and Johnson on an adjacent road.The two Union forces were soon united and a mounted battle ensued.The
ground being level, the maneuvering of the squadrons was easy.The clink
of the sabers rang out in the morning air.The Confederate center held together, but its flanks gave way.The Federals charged along the whole front, with a momentum that forced
the Southern cavalrymen to flee from the field.They left in the hands of
the Federal troopers over three hundred prisoners, all their artillery,
except one piece, and nearly every wagon the Confederate cavalry had with
them.The Northern army continued its retrograde movement, and on the 10th
crossed to the north side of Cedar Creek.Early's army in the mean time
had taken a position at the wooded base of Fisher's Hill, four miles
away.The Sixth Corps started for Washington, but the news of Early at
Fisher's Hill led to its recall.The Union forces occupied ground that was
considered practically unassailable, especially on the left, where the
deep gorge of the Shenandoah, along whose front rose the bold Massanutten
Mountain, gave it natural protection.The movements of the Confederate army were screened by the wooded ravines
in front of Fisher's Hill, while, from the summit of the neighboring Three
Top Mountain, its officers could view, as in a panorama, the entire Union
camp.Seemingly secure, the corps of Crook on the left of the Union line
was not well protected.The keen-eyed Gordon saw the weak point in the
Union position.Ingenious plans to break it down were quickly made.Meanwhile, Sheridan was summoned to Washington to consult with Secretary
Stanton.He did not believe that Early proposed an immediate attack, and
started on the 15th, escorted by the cavalry, and leaving General Wright
in command.At Front Royal the next day word came from Wright enclosing a
message taken for the Confederate signal-flag on Three Top Mountain.It
was from Longstreet, advising Early that he would join him and crush
Sheridan.The latter sent the cavalry back to Wright, and continued on to
Washington, whence he returned at once by special train, reaching
Winchester on the evening of the 18th.Just after dark on October 18th, a part of Early's army under the command
of General John B. Gordon, with noiseless steps, moved out from their
camp, through the misty, autumn night.The men had been stripped of their
canteens, in fear that the striking of them against some object might
reveal their movements.Their path
followed along the base of the mountain--a dim and narrow trail, upon
which but one man might pass at a time.For seven miles this sinuous line
made its way through the dark gorge, crossing the Shenandoah, and at
times passing within four hundred yards of the Union pickets.It arrived at the appointed place, opposite Crook's camp on the Federal
right, an hour before the attack was to be made.In the shivering air of
the early morning, the men crouched on the river bank, waiting for the
coming of the order to move forward.At last, at five o'clock, it came.They plunged into the frosty water of the river, emerged on the other
side, marched in "double quick," and were soon sounding a reveille to the
sleeping troops of Sheridan.The minie balls whizzed and sang through the
tents.In the gray mists of the dawn the legions of the South looked like
phantom warriors, as they poured through the unmanned gaps.The
Northerners sprang to arms.Their eyes saw the flames from the Southern muskets; the men felt the
breath of the hot muzzles in their faces, while the Confederate bayonets
were at their breasts.There was a brief struggle, then panic and
disorganization.Only a quarter of an hour of this yelling and struggling,
and two-thirds of the Union army broke like a mill-dam and poured across
the fields, leaving their accouterments of war and the stiffening bodies
of their comrades.Rosser, with the cavalry, attacked Custer and assisted
Gordon.Meanwhile, during these same early morning hours, General Early had
himself advanced to Cedar Creek by a more direct route.At half-past three
o'clock his men had come in sight of the Union camp-fires.They waited
under cover for the approach of day.At the first blush of dawn and before
the charge of Gordon, Early hurled his men across the stream, swept over
the breastworks, captured the batteries and turned them upon the
unsuspecting Northerners.The Federal generals tried to stem the impending
disaster.From the east of the battlefield the solid lines of Gordon were
now driving the fugitives of Crook's corps by the mere force of momentum.Aides were darting hither and thither, trying to reassemble the crumbling
lines.The Nineteenth Corps, under Emory, tried to hold its ground; for a
time it fought alone, but after a desperate effort to hold its own, it,
too, melted away under the scorching fire.The fields to the rear of the
army were covered with wagons, ambulances, stragglers, and fleeing
soldiers.As it slowly fell to the rear it
would, at times, turn to fight.At last it found a place where it again
stood at bay.The men hastily gathered rails and constructed rude
field-works.At the same time the Confederates paused in their advance.There was scarcely any firing except for
the occasional roar of a long-range artillery gun.The Southerners seemed
willing to rest on their well-earned laurels of the morning.In the
language of the successful commander, it was "glory enough for one day."But the brilliant morning victory was about to be changed to a singular
afternoon defeat.During the morning's fight, when the Union troops were
being rapidly overwhelmed with panic, Rienzi, the beautiful jet-black
war-charger, was bearing his master, the commander of the Federal army, to
the field of disaster.Along the broad valley highway that leads from
Winchester, General Sheridan had galloped to where his embattled lines had
been reduced to a flying mob.While riding leisurely away from Winchester
about nine o'clock he had heard unmistakable thunder-peals of artillery.Realizing that a battle was on in the front, he hastened forward, soon to
be met, as he crossed Mill Creek, by the trains and men of his routed
army, coming to the rear with appalling rapidity.News from the field told him of the crushing defeat of his hitherto
invincible regiments.The road was blocked by the retreating crowds as
they pressed toward the rear.The commander was forced to take to the
fields, and as his steed, flecked with foam, bore him onward, the
disheartened refugees greeted him with cheers.Taking off his hat as he
rode, he cried, "We will go back and recover our camps."The words seemed
to inspire the demoralized soldiers.Stragglers fell into line behind him;
men turned to follow their magnetic leader back to the fight.Vaulting his horse over the low barricade of rails, he dashed to the crest
of the field.There was a flutter along the battle-line.The men from
behind their protecting wall broke into thunderous cheers.From the rear
of the soldiers there suddenly arose, as from the earth, a line of the
regimental flags, which waved recognition to their leader.Early made another assault
after one o'clock, but was easily repulsed.It was nearly four o'clock when the order for the Federal advance was
given.General Sheridan, hat in hand, rode in front of his infantry line
that his men might see him.The Confederate forces now occupied a series
of wooded crests.From out of the shadow of one of these timbered coverts,
a column of gray was emerging.The Union lines stood waiting for the
impending crash.It came in a devouring succession of volleys that
reverberated into a deep and sullen roar.The Union infantry rose as one
man and passed in among the trees.Then, suddenly,
there came a screaming, humming rush of shell, a roar of musketry mingling
with the yells of a successful charge.Again the firing ceased, except for
occasional outbursts.The Confederates had taken a new position and
reopened with a galling fire.General Sheridan dashed along the front of
his lines in personal charge of the attack.Again his men moved toward the
lines of Early's fast thinning ranks.The Union
cavalry swept in behind the fleeing troops of Early and sent, again, his
veteran army "whirling up the Valley."The battle of Cedar Creek was ended; the tumult died away.The Federal
loss had been about fifty-seven hundred; the Confederate over three
thousand.Fourteen hundred Union prisoners were sent to Richmond.Never
again would the gaunt specter of war hover over Washington.[Illustration: GENERAL JUBAL A. EARLY, THE CONFEDERATE RAIDER WHO

since the withdrawal of most of the troops whose duty it had been to guard
the city.Early's approach in July, 1864, found the Nation's capital
entirely unprotected.Naturally there was a flutter throughout the
peaceable groups of non-combatants that made up the population of
Washington at that time, as well as in official circles.There were less
than seventy thousand people living in the city in 1864, a large
proportion of whom were in some way connected with the Government.[Illustration: PROTECTING LOCOMOTIVES FROM THE CONFEDERATE RAIDER

no trained artillerists to man them.Big as they were, they gave Early no
occasion for alarm.[Illustration: ENTRANCE TO WASHINGTON FROM THE SOUTH--THE FAMOUS "CHAIN

reason why Early did not make his approach to the capital from the

the roads to Long Bridge (shown below), and there was no way of marching
troops into the city from the south, excepting over such exposed passages.Most of the troops left for the defense of the city were on the Virginia
side.Therefore Early wisely picked out the northern outposts as the more
vulnerable.Long Bridge was closely guarded at all times, like Chain
Bridge and the other approaches, and at night the planks of its floor were
removed.[Illustration: LONG BRIDGE AND THE CAPITOL ACROSS THE BROAD POTOMAC

Constant drill at the guns went on in the defenses of Washington
throughout the war.At its close in April, 1865, there were 68 enclosed
forts and batteries, whose aggregate perimeter was thirteen miles, 807
guns and 98 mortars mounted, and emplacements for 1,120 guns, ninety-three
unarmed batteries for field-guns, 35,711 yards of rifle-trenches, and
three block-houses encircling the Northern capital.The entire extent of
front of the lines was thirty-seven miles; and thirty-two miles of
military roads, besides those previously existing in the District of
Columbia, formed the means of interior communication.In all these forts
constant preparation was made for a possible onslaught of the
Confederates, and many of the troops were trained which later went to take
part in the siege of Petersburg where the heavy artillery fought bravely
as infantry.[Illustration]

ramparts, and a surgeon who stood by his side was wounded.These works

After the disastrous clash of the two armies at Cold Harbor, Grant
remained a few days in his entrenchments trying in vain to find a weak
place in Lee's lines.The combatants were now due east of Richmond, and
the Federal general realized that it would be impossible at this time to
attain the object for which he had struggled ever since he crossed the
Rapidan on the 4th of May--to turn Lee's right flank and interpose his
forces between the Army of Northern Virginia and the capital of the
Confederacy.His opponent, one of the very greatest military leaders the
Anglo-Saxon race has produced, with an army of but little more than half
the number of the Federal host, had successfully blocked the attempts to
carry out this plan in three great battles and by a remarkable maneuver on
the southern bank of the North Anna, which had forced Grant to recross the
river and which will always remain a subject of curious interest to
students of the art of war.In one month the Union army had lost fifty-five thousand men, while the
Confederate losses had been comparatively small.The cost to the North had
been too great; Lee could not be cut off from his capital, and the most
feasible project was now to join in the move which heretofore had been the
special object of General Butler and the Army of the James, and attack
Richmond itself.South of the city, at a distance of twenty-one miles, was
the town of Petersburg.Its defenses were not strong, although General
Gillmore of Butler's army had failed in an attempt to seize them on the
10th of June.Three railroads converged here and these were main arteries
of Lee's supply.He sent
General W. F. Smith, who had come to his aid at Cold Harbor with the
flower of the Army of the James, back to Bermuda Hundred by water, as he
had come, with instructions to hasten to Petersburg before Lee could get
there.Smith arrived on the 15th and was joined by Hancock with the first
troops of the Army of the Potomac to appear, but the attack was not
pressed and Beauregard who, with only two thousand men, was in desperate
straits until Lee should reach him, managed to hold the inner line of
trenches.The last of Grant's forces were across the James by midnight of June 16th,
while Lee took a more westerly and shorter route to Petersburg.The
fighting there was continued as the two armies came up, but each Union
attack was successfully repulsed.At the close of day on the 18th both
opponents were in full strength and the greatest struggle of modern times
was begun.Impregnable bastioned works began to show themselves around
Petersburg.More than thirty miles of frowning redoubts connected
extensive breastworks and were strengthened by mortar batteries and
field-works which lined the fields near the Appomattox River.It was a
vast net of fortifications, but there was no formal siege of Lee's
position, which was a new entrenched line selected by Beauregard some
distance behind the rifle-pits where he had held out at such great odds
against Hancock and Smith.Grant, as soon as the army was safely protected, started to extend his
lines on the west and south, in order to envelop the Confederate right
flank.He also bent his energies to destroying the railroads upon which
Lee depended for supplies.On
June 22d two corps of the Union army set out for the Weldon Railroad, but
they became separated and were put to flight by A. P. Hill.The Federal
cavalry also joined in the work, but the vigilant Confederate horsemen
under W. H. F. Lee prevented any serious damage to the iron way, and by
July 2d the last of the raiders were back in the Federal lines, much the
worse for the rough treatment they had received.Now ensued some weeks of quiet during which both armies were
strengthening their fortifications.On June 25th Sheridan returned from
his cavalry raid on the Virginia Central Railroad running north from
Richmond.He had encountered Hampton and Fitzhugh Lee at Trevilian Station
on June 11th, and turned back after doing great damage to the railway.Ammunition was running short and he did not dare risk another engagement.Sheridan was destined not to remain long with the army in front of
Petersburg.Lee had detached a corps from his forces and, under Early, it
had been doing great damage in Maryland and Pennsylvania.So Grant's
cavalry leader was put at the head of an army and sent to the Shenandoah
valley to drive Early's troops from the base of their operations.Meanwhile the Federals were covertly engaged in an undertaking which was
fated to result in conspicuous failure.Some skilled miners from the upper
Schuylkill coal regions in the Forty-eighth Pennsylvania attached to the
Ninth Corps were boring a tunnel from the rear of the Union works
underneath the Confederate fortifications.Eight thousand pounds of
gunpowder were placed in lateral galleries at the end of the tunnel.At
twenty minutes to five on the morning of July 30th, the mine was exploded.A solid mass of earth and all manner of material shot two hundred feet
into the air.Three hundred human beings were buried in the debris as it
fell back into the gaping crater.The smoke had barely cleared away when
General Ledlie led his waiting troops into the vast opening.The horror of
the sight sickened the assailants, and in crowding into the pit they
became completely demoralized.In the confusion officers lost power to
reorganize, much less to control, their troops.The stunned and paralyzed Confederates were not long in recovering their
wits.Batteries opened upon the approach to the crater, and presently a
stream of fire was poured into the pit itself.General Mahone hastened up
with his Georgia and Virginia troops, and there were several desperate
charges before the Federals withdrew at Burnside's order.Grant had had
great expectations that the mine would result in his capturing Petersburg
and he was much disappointed.In order to get a part of Lee's army away
from the scene of what he hoped would be the final struggle, Hancock's
troops and a large force of cavalry had been sent north of the James, as
if a move on Richmond had been planned.In the mine fiasco on that fatal
July 30th, thirty-nine hundred men (nearly all from Burnside's corps) were
lost to the Union side.In the torrid days of mid-August Grant renewed his attacks upon the Weldon
Railroad, and General Warren was sent to capture it.He reached Globe
Tavern, about four miles from Petersburg, when he encountered General
Heth, who drove him back.Warren did not return to the Federal lines but
entrenched along the iron way.The next day he was fiercely attacked by
the Confederate force now strongly reenforced by Mahone.Mahone forced his way through the skirmish line and then
turned and fought his opponents from their rear.Another of his divisions
struck the Union right wing.In this extremity two thousand of Warren's
troops were captured and all would have been lost but for the timely
arrival of Burnside's men.Two days later the Southerners renewed the battle and now thirty cannon
poured volley after volley upon the Fifth and Ninth corps.The dashing
Mahone again came forward with his usual impetuousness, but the blue line
finally drove Lee's men back.And so the Weldon Railroad fell into the
hands of General Grant.Hancock, with the Second Corps, returned from the
north bank of the James and set to work to assist in destroying the
railway, whose loss was a hard blow to General Lee.It was not to be
expected that the latter would permit this work to continue unmolested and
on the 25th of August, A. P. Hill suddenly confronted Hancock, who
entrenched himself in haste at Ream's Station.This did not save the
Second Corps, which for the first time in its glorious career was put to
rout.Their very guns were captured and turned upon them.In the following weeks there were no actions of importance except that in
the last days of September Generals Ord and Birney, with the Army of the
James, captured Fort Harrison, on the north bank of that river, from
Generals Ewell and Anderson.The Federals were anxious to have it, since
it was an excellent vantage point from which to threaten Richmond.Meanwhile Grant was constantly extending his line to the west and by the
end of October it was very close to the South Side Railroad.On the 27th
there was a hard fight at Hatcher's Run, but the Confederates saved the
railway and the Federals returned to their entrenchments in front of
Petersburg.The active struggle now ceased, but Lee found himself each day in more
desperate straits.Sheridan had played sad havoc with such sources of
supply as existed in the rich country to the northwest.The Weldon
Railroad was gone and the South Side line was in imminent danger.Many went home for the winter on a promise
to return when the spring planting was done.Lee was loath to let them go,
but he could ill afford to maintain them, and the very life of their
families depended upon it.Those who remained at Petersburg suffered
cruelly from hunger and cold.They looked forward to the spring, although
it meant renewal of the mighty struggle.The Confederate line had been
stretched to oppose Grant's westward progress until it had become the
thinnest of screens.A man lost to Lee was almost impossible to replace,
while the bounties offered in the North kept Grant's ranks full.[Illustration: MAHONE, "THE HERO OF THE CRATER"

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]General William Mahone, C. S. A. It was through the promptness and valor
of General Mahone that the Southerners, on July 30, 1864, were enabled to
turn back upon the Federals the disaster threatened by the hidden mine.On
the morning of the explosion there were but eighteen thousand Confederates
left to hold the ten miles of lines about Petersburg.Everything seemed to
favor Grant's plans for the crushing of this force.Immediately after the
mine was sprung, a terrific cannonade was opened from one hundred and
fifty guns and mortars to drive back the Confederates from the breach,
while fifty thousand Federals stood ready to charge upon the
panic-stricken foe.But the foe was not panic-stricken long.Colonel
McMaster, of the Seventeenth South Carolina, gathered the remnants of
General Elliott's brigade and held back the Federals massing at the Crater
until General Mahone arrived at the head of three brigades.At once he
prepared to attack the Federals, who at that moment were advancing to the
left of the Crater.In his inspiring
presence it swept with such vigor that the Federals were driven back and
dared not risk another assault.At the Crater, Lee had what Grant
lacked--a man able to direct the entire engagement.[Illustration: WHAT EIGHT THOUSAND POUNDS OF POWDER DID

1864, the fifty thousand Federal troops waiting to make a charge saw a
great mass of earth hurled skyward like a water-spout.As it spread out
into an immense cloud, scattering guns, carriages, timbers, and what were
once human beings, the front ranks broke in panic; it looked as if the
mass were descending upon their own heads.The men were quickly rallied;
across the narrow plain they charged, through the awful breach, and up the
heights beyond to gain Cemetery Ridge.But there were brave fighters on
the other side still left, and delay among the Federals enabled the
Confederates to rally and re-form in time to drive the Federals back down
the steep sides of the Crater.There, as they struggled amidst the
horrible debris, one disaster after another fell upon them.Huddled
together, the mass of men was cut to pieces by the canister poured upon
them from well-planted Confederate batteries.At last, as a forlorn hope,
the <DW52> troops were sent forward; and they, too, were hurled back into
the Crater and piled upon their white comrades.[Illustration: FORT MAHONE--"FORT DAMNATION"

while Fort Sedgwick, which was no less active in reply, was known to the
Confederates as Fort Hell.Gracie's salient, further north on the
Confederate line, is notable as the point in front of which General John

desperate effort of the Confederates to break through the Federal cordon.The views of Gracie's salient show the French form of chevaux-de-frise, a

SHERMAN'S FINAL CAMPAIGNS

    I only regarded the march from Atlanta to Savannah as a "shift of
    base," as the transfer of a strong army, which had no opponent, and
    had finished its then work, from the interior to a point on the sea
    coast, from which it could achieve other important results.I
    considered this march as a means to an end, and not as an essential
    act of war.Still, then as now, the march to the sea was generally
    regarded as something extraordinary, something anomalous, something
    out of the usual order of events; whereas, in fact, I simply moved
    from Atlanta to Savannah, as one step in the direction of Richmond, a
    movement that had to be met and defeated, or the war was necessarily
    at an end.--_General W. T. Sherman, in his "Memoirs."_


The march to the sea, in which General William T. Sherman won undying fame
in the Civil War, is one of the greatest pageants in the world's
warfare--as fearful in its destruction as it is historic in its import.But this was not Sherman's chief achievement; it was an easy task compared
with the great campaign between Chattanooga and Atlanta through which he
had just passed."As a military accomplishment it was little more than a
grand picnic," declared one of his division commanders, in speaking of the
march through Georgia and the Carolinas.Almost immediately after the capture of Atlanta, Sherman, deciding to
remain there for some time and to make it a Federal military center,
ordered all the inhabitants to be removed.General Hood pronounced the act
one of ingenious cruelty, transcending any that had ever before come to
his notice in the dark history of the war.Sherman insisted that his act
was one of kindness, and that Johnston and Hood themselves had done the
same--removed families from their homes--in other places.Many of the people of Atlanta chose to go southward,
others to the north, the latter being transported free, by Sherman's
order, as far as Chattanooga.Shortly after the middle of September, Hood moved his army from Lovejoy's
Station, just south of Atlanta, to the vicinity of Macon.Here Jefferson
Davis visited the encampment, and on the 22d he made a speech to the
homesick Army of Tennessee, which, reported in the Southern newspapers,
disclosed to Sherman the new plans of the Confederate leaders.These
involved nothing less than a fresh invasion of Tennessee, which, in the
opinion of President Davis, would put Sherman in a predicament worse than
that in which Napoleon found himself at Moscow.But, forewarned, the
Federal leader prepared to thwart his antagonists.The line of the Western
and Atlantic Railroad was more closely guarded.Divisions were sent to
Rome and to Chattanooga.Thomas was ordered to Nashville, and Schofield to
Knoxville.Recruits were hastened from the North to these points, in order
that Sherman himself might not be weakened by the return of too many
troops to these places.Hood, in the hope of leading Sherman away from Atlanta, crossed the
Chattahoochee on the 1st of October, destroyed the railroad above Marietta
and sent General French against Allatoona.It was the brave defense of
this place by General John M. Corse that brought forth Sherman's famous
message, "Hold out; relief is coming," sent by his signal officers from
the heights of Kenesaw Mountain, and which thrilled the North and inspired
its poets to eulogize Corse's bravery in verse.Corse had been ordered
from Rome to Allatoona by signals from mountain to mountain, over the
heads of the Confederate troops, who occupied the valley between.Reaching
the mountain pass soon after midnight, on October 5th, Corse added his
thousand men to the nine hundred already there, and soon after daylight
the battle began.General French, in command of the Confederates, first
summoned Corse to surrender, and, receiving a defiant answer, opened with
his guns.Nearly all the day the fire was terrific from besieged and
besiegers, and the losses on both sides were very heavy.During the battle Sherman was on Kenesaw Mountain, eighteen miles away,
from which he could see the cloud of smoke and hear the faint
reverberation of the cannons' boom.When he learned by signal that Corse
was there and in command, he said, "If Corse is there, he will hold out; I
know the man."And he did hold out, and saved the stores at Allatoona, at
a loss of seven hundred of his men, he himself being among the wounded,
while French lost about eight hundred.General Hood continued to move northward to Resaca and Dalton, passing
over the same ground on which the two great armies had fought during the
spring and summer.He destroyed the railroads, burned the ties, and
twisted the rails, leaving greater havoc, if possible, in a country that
was already a wilderness of desolation.For some weeks Sherman followed
Hood in the hope that a general engagement would result.He went on to the banks of the Tennessee opposite
Florence, Alabama.His army was lightly equipped, and Sherman, with his
heavily burdened troops, was unable to catch him.Sherman halted at
Gaylesville and ordered Schofield, with the Twenty-third Corps, and
Stanley, with the Fourth Corps, to Thomas at Nashville.Sherman thereupon determined to return to Atlanta, leaving General Thomas
to meet Hood's appearance in Tennessee.It was about this time that
Sherman fully decided to march to the sea.Some time before this he had
telegraphed to Grant: "Hood... can constantly break my roads.I would
infinitely prefer to make a wreck of the road... send back all my wounded
and worthless, and, with my effective army, move through Georgia, smashing
things to the sea."Grant thought it best for Sherman to destroy Hood's
army first, but Sherman insisted that his plan would put him on the
offensive rather than the defensive.He also believed that Hood would be
forced to follow him.Grant was finally won to the view that if Hood moved
on Tennessee, Thomas would be able to check him.He had, on the 11th of
October, given permission for the march.Now, on the 2d of November, he
telegraphed Sherman at Rome: "I do not really see that you can withdraw
from where you are to follow Hood without giving up all we have gained in
territory.I say, then, go on as you propose."It was Sherman, and not
Grant or Lincoln, that conceived the great march, and while the march
itself was not seriously opposed or difficult to carry out, the conception
and purpose were masterly.Sherman moved his army by slow and easy stages back to Atlanta.He sent
the vast army stores that had collected at Atlanta, which he could not
take with him, as well as his sick and wounded, to Chattanooga, destroyed
the railroad to that place, also the machine-shops at Rome and other
places, and on November 12th, after receiving a final despatch from Thomas
and answering simply, "Despatch received--all right," the last telegraph
line was severed, and Sherman had deliberately cut himself off from all
communication with the Northern States.There is no incident like it in
the annals of war.A strange event it was, as Sherman observes in his
memoirs."Two hostile armies marching in opposite directions, each in the
full belief that it was achieving a final and conclusive result in a great
war."For the next two days all was astir in Atlanta.The great depot,
round-house, and machine-shops were destroyed.Walls were battered down;
chimneys pulled over; machinery smashed to pieces, and boilers punched
full of holes.Heaps of rubbish covered the spots where these fine
buildings had stood, and on the night of November 15th the vast debris was
set on fire.The torch was also applied to many places in the business
part of the city, in defiance of the strict orders of Captain Poe, who
had the work of destruction in charge.The court-house and a large part of
the dwellings escaped the flames.Preparations for the great march were made with extreme care.Defective
wagons and horses were discarded; the number of heavy guns to be carried
along was sixty-five, the remainder having been sent to Chattanooga.The
marching army numbered about sixty thousand, five thousand of whom
belonged to the cavalry and eighteen hundred to the artillery.The army
was divided into two immense wings, the Right, the Army of the Tennessee,
commanded by General O. O. Howard, and consisting of the Fifteenth and
Seventeenth corps, and the Left, the Army of Georgia, by General Henry W.
Slocum, composed the Fourteenth and Twentieth corps.There were twenty-five hundred wagons, each drawn by
six mules; six hundred ambulances, with two horses each, while the heavy
guns, caissons, and forges were each drawn by eight horses.A twenty days'
supply of bread, forty of coffee, sugar, and salt was carried with the
army, and a large herd of cattle was driven on foot.In Sherman's general instructions it was provided that the army should
march by four roads as nearly parallel as possible, except the cavalry,
which remained under the direct control of the general commanding.The
army was directed "to forage liberally on the country," but, except along
the roadside, this was to be done by organized foraging parties appointed
by the brigade commanders.Orders were issued forbidding soldiers to enter
private dwellings or to commit any trespass.The corps commanders were
given the option of destroying mills, cotton-gins, and the like, and where
the army was molested in its march by the burning of bridges, obstructing
the roads, and so forth, the devastation should be made "more or less
relentless, according to the measure of such hostility."The cavalry and
artillery and the foraging parties were permitted to take horses, mules,
and wagons from the inhabitants without limit, except that they were to
discriminate in favor of the poor.It was a remarkable military
undertaking, in which it was intended to remove restrictions only to a
sufficient extent to meet the requirements of the march.The cavalry was
commanded by General Judson Kilpatrick, who, after receiving a severe
wound at Resaca, in May, had gone to his home on the banks of the Hudson,
in New York, to recuperate, and, against the advice of his physician, had
joined the army again at Atlanta.On November 15th, most of the great army was started on its march, Sherman
himself riding out from the city next morning.As he rode near the spot
where General McPherson had fallen, he paused and looked back at the
receding city with its smoking ruins, its blackened walls, and its lonely,
tenantless houses.The vision of the desperate battles, of the hope and
fear of the past few months, rose before him, as he tells us, "like the
memory of a dream."The day was as perfect as Nature ever gives.They sang and shouted and waved their banners in the
autumn breeze.Most of them supposed they were going directly toward
Richmond, nearly a thousand miles away.As Sherman rode past them they
would call out, "Uncle Billy, I guess Grant is waiting for us at
Richmond."Only the commanders of the wings and Kilpatrick were entrusted
with the secret of Sherman's intentions.But even Sherman was not fully
decided as to his objective--Savannah, Georgia, or Port Royal, South
Carolina--until well on the march.There was one certainty, however--he was fully decided to keep the
Confederates in suspense as to his intentions.To do this the more
effectually he divided his army at the start, Howard leading his wing to
Gordon by way of McDonough as if to threaten Macon, while Slocum proceeded
to Covington and Madison, with Milledgeville as his goal.Both were
secretly instructed to halt, seven days after starting, at Gordon and
Milledgeville, the latter the capital of Georgia, about a hundred miles to
the southeast.General Hood and General Beauregard, who had come from the East to assist
him, were in Tennessee, and it was some days after Sherman had left
Atlanta that they heard of his movements.They realized that to follow him
would now be futile.He was nearly three hundred miles away, and not only
were the railroads destroyed, but a large part of the intervening country
was utterly laid waste and incapable of supporting an army.The
Confederates thereupon turned their attention to Thomas, who was also in
Tennessee, and was the barrier between Hood and the Northern States.General Sherman accompanied first one corps of his army and then another.The first few days he spent with Davis' corps of Slocum's wing.When they
reached Covington, the <DW64>s met the troops in great numbers, shouting
and thanking the Lord that "deliverance" had come at last.As Sherman rode
along the streets they would gather around his horse and exhibit every
evidence of adoration.The foraging parties consisted of companies of fifty men.Their route for
the day in which they obtained supplies was usually parallel to that of
the army, five or six miles from it.They would start out before daylight
in the morning, many of them on foot; but when they rejoined the column in
the evening they were no longer afoot.They were astride mules, horses, in
family carriages, farm wagons, and mule carts, which they packed with
hams, bacon, vegetables, chickens, ducks, and every imaginable product of
a Southern farm that could be useful to an army.In the general orders, Sherman had forbidden the soldiers to enter private
houses; but the order was not strictly adhered to, as many Southern people
have since testified.Sherman declares in his memoirs that these acts of
pillage and violence were exceptional and incidental.On one occasion
Sherman saw a man with a ham on his musket, a jug of molasses under his
arm, and a big piece of honey in his hand.As the man saw that he was
observed by the commander, he quoted audibly to a comrade, from the
general order, "forage liberally on the country."But the general reproved
him and explained that foraging must be carried on only by regularly
designated parties.It is a part of military history that Sherman's sole purpose was to weaken
the Confederacy by recognized means of honorable warfare; but it cannot be
denied that there were a great many instances, unknown to him,
undoubtedly, of cowardly hold-ups of the helpless inhabitants, or
ransacking of private boxes and drawers in search of jewelry and other
family treasure.This is one of the misfortunes of war--one of war's
injustices.Such practices always exist even under the most rigid
discipline in great armies, and the jubilation of this march was such that
human nature asserted itself in the license of warfare more than on most
other occasions.General Washington met with similar situations in the
American Revolution.The practice is never confined to either army in
warfare.Opposed to Sherman were Wheeler's cavalry, and a large portion of the
Georgia State troops which were turned over by General G. W. Smith to
General Howell Cobb.Kilpatrick and his horsemen, proceeding toward Macon,
were confronted by Wheeler and Cobb, but the Federal troopers drove them
back into the town.However, they issued forth again, and on November 21st
there was a sharp engagement with Kilpatrick at Griswoldville.The
following day the Confederates were definitely checked and retreated.The night of November 22d, Sherman spent in the home of General Cobb, who
had been a member of the United States Congress and of Buchanan's Cabinet.Thousands of soldiers encamped that night on Cobb's plantation, using his
fences for camp-fire fuel.By Sherman's order, everything on the
plantation movable or destructible was carried away next day, or
destroyed.By the next night both corps of the Left Wing were at Milledgeville, and
on the 24th started for Sandersville.Howard's wing was at Gordon, and it
left there on the day that Slocum moved from Milledgeville for Irwin's
Crossroads.A hundred miles below Milledgeville was a place called Millen,
and here were many Federal prisoners which Sherman greatly desired to
release.With this in view he sent Kilpatrick toward Augusta to give the
impression that the army was marching thither, lest the Confederates
should remove the prisoners from Millen.Kilpatrick had reached Waynesboro
when he learned that the prisoners had been taken away.Here he again
encountered the Confederate cavalry under General Wheeler.A sharp fight
ensued and Kilpatrick drove Wheeler through the town toward Augusta.As
there was no further need of making a feint on Augusta, Kilpatrick turned
back toward the Left Wing.Wheeler quickly followed and at Thomas' Station
nearly surrounded him, but Kilpatrick cut his way out.Wheeler still
pressed on and Kilpatrick chose a good position at Buck Head Creek,
dismounted, and threw up breastworks.Wheeler attacked desperately, but
was repulsed, and Kilpatrick, after being reenforced by a brigade from
Davis' corps, joined the Left Wing at Louisville.On the whole, the great march was but little disturbed by the
Confederates.The Georgia militia, probably ten thousand in all, did what
they could to defend their homes and their firesides; but their endeavors
were futile against the vast hosts that were sweeping through the country.In the skirmishes that took place between Atlanta and the sea the militia
was soon brushed aside.Even their destroying of bridges and supplies in
front of the invading army checked its progress but for a moment, as it
was prepared for every such emergency.Wheeler, with his cavalry, caused
more trouble, and engaged Kilpatrick's attention a large part of the time.But even he did not seriously <DW44> the irresistible progress of the
legions of the North.The great army kept on its way by various routes, covering about fifteen
miles a day, and leaving a swath of destruction, from forty to sixty miles
wide, in its wake.Among the details attendant upon the march to the sea
was that of scientifically destroying the railroads that traversed the
region.Battalions of engineers had received special instruction in the
art, together with the necessary implements to facilitate rapid work.But
the infantry soon entered this service, too, and it was a common sight to
see a thousand soldiers in blue standing beside a stretch of railway, and,
when commanded, bend as one man and grasp the rail, and at a second
command to raise in unison, which brought a thousand railroad ties up on
end.Then the men fell upon them, ripping rail and tie apart, the rails to
be heated to a white heat and bent in fantastic shapes about some
convenient tree or other upright column, the ties being used as the fuel
with which to make the fires.All public buildings that might have a
military use were burned, together with a great number of private
dwellings and barns, some by accident, others wantonly.This fertile and
prosperous region, after the army had passed, was a scene of ruin and
desolation.As the army progressed, throngs of escaped slaves followed in its trail,
"from the baby in arms to the old <DW64> hobbling painfully along," says
General Howard, "<DW64>s of all sizes, in all sorts of patched costumes,
with carts and broken-down horses and mules to match."Many of the old
<DW64>s found it impossible to keep pace with the army for many days, and
having abandoned their homes and masters who could have cared for them,
they were left to die of hunger and exposure in that naked land.After the Ogeechee River was crossed, the character of the country was
greatly changed from that of central Georgia.No longer were there fertile
farms, laden with their Southern harvests of corn and vegetables, but
rather rice plantations and great pine forests, the solemn stillness of
which was broken by the tread of thousands of troops, the rumbling of
wagon-trains, and by the shouts and music of the marching men and of the
motley crowd of <DW64>s that followed.Day by day Sherman issued orders for the progress of the wings, but on
December 2d they contained the decisive words, "Savannah."What a tempting
prize was this fine Southern city, and how the Northern commander would
add to his laurels could he effect its capture!The memories clinging
about the historic old town, with its beautiful parks and its
magnolia-lined streets, are part of the inheritance of not only the South,
but of all America.Here Oglethorpe had bartered with the wild men of the
forest, and here, in the days of the Revolution, Count Pulaski and
Sergeant Jasper had given up their lives in the cause of liberty.Sherman had partially invested the city before the middle of December; but
it was well fortified and he refrained from assault.General Hardee, sent
by Hood from Tennessee, had command of the defenses, with about eighteen
thousand men.And there was Fort McAllister on the Ogeechee, protecting
the city on the south.But this obstruction to the Federals was soon
removed.General Hazen's division of the Fifteenth Corps was sent to
capture the fort.At five o'clock in the afternoon of the 13th Hazen's men
rushed through a shower of grape, over abatis and hidden torpedoes, scaled
the parapet and captured the garrison.That night Sherman boarded the
_Dandelion_, a Union vessel, in the river, and sent a message to the
outside world, the first since he had left Atlanta.Henceforth there was communication between the army and the Federal
squadron, under the command of Admiral Dahlgren.Among the vessels that
came up the river there was one that was received with great enthusiasm by
the soldiers.It brought mail, tons of it, for Sherman's army, the
accumulation of two months.One can imagine the eagerness with which
these war-stained veterans opened the longed-for letters and sought the
answer to the ever-recurring question, "How are things at home?"Sherman had set his heart on capturing Savannah; but, on December 15th, he
received a letter from Grant which greatly disturbed him.Grant ordered
him to leave his artillery and cavalry, with infantry enough to support
them, and with the remainder of his army to come by sea to Virginia and
join the forces before Richmond.Sherman prepared to obey, but hoped that
he would be able to capture the city before the transports would be ready
to carry him northward.He first called on Hardee to surrender the city, with a threat of
bombardment.Sherman hesitated to open with his guns
because of the bloodshed it would occasion, and on December 21st he was
greatly relieved to discover that Hardee had decided not to defend the
city, that he had escaped with his army the night before, by the one road
that was still open to him, which led across the Savannah River into the
Carolinas.The stream had been spanned by an improvised pontoon bridge,
consisting of river-boats, with planks from city wharves for flooring and
with old car-wheels for anchors.Sherman immediately took possession of
the city, and on December 22d he sent to President Lincoln this message:
"I beg to present to you, as a Christmas gift, the city of Savannah, with
one hundred and fifty heavy guns and plenty of ammunition, and also about
twenty-five thousand bales of cotton."As a matter of fact, over two
hundred and fifty guns were captured, and thirty-one thousand bales of
cotton.Events in the West now changed Grant's views as to Sherman's joining him
immediately in Virginia.On the 16th of December, General Thomas
accomplished the defeat and utter rout of Hood's army at Nashville.In
addition, it was found that, owing to lack of transports, it would take at
least two months to transfer Sherman's whole army by sea.Therefore, it
was decided that Sherman should march through the Carolinas, destroying
the railroads in both States as he went.A little more than a month
Sherman remained in Savannah.Then he began another great march, compared
with which, as Sherman himself declared, the march to the sea was as
child's play.The size of his army on leaving Savannah was practically the
same as when he left Atlanta--sixty thousand.It was divided into two
wings, under the same commanders, Howard and Slocum, and was to be
governed by the same rules.The
march from Savannah averaged ten miles a day, which, in view of the
conditions, was a very high average.The weather in the early part of the
journey was exceedingly wet and the roads were well-nigh impassable.Where
they were not actually under water the mud rendered them impassable until
corduroyed.Moreover, the troops had to wade streams, to drag themselves
through swamps and quagmires, and to remove great trees that had been
felled across their pathway.The city of Savannah was left under the control of General J. G. Foster,
and the Left Wing of Sherman's army under Slocum moved up the Savannah
River, accompanied by Kilpatrick, and crossed it at Sister's Ferry.The
river was overflowing its banks and the crossing, by means of a pontoon
bridge, was effected with the greatest difficulty.The Right Wing, under
Howard, embarked for Beaufort, South Carolina, and moved thence to
Pocotaligo, near the Broad River, whither Sherman had preceded it, and the
great march northward was fairly begun by February 1, 1865.Sherman had given out the word that he expected to go to Charleston or
Augusta, his purpose being to deceive the Confederates, since he had made
up his mind to march straight to Columbia, the capital of South Carolina.The two wings of the army were soon united and they continued their great
march from one end of the State of South Carolina to the other.The men
felt less restraint in devastating the country and despoiling the people
than they had felt in Georgia.The reason for this, given by Sherman and
others, was that there was a feeling of bitterness against South Carolina
as against no other State.It was this State that had led the procession
of seceding States and that had fired on Fort Sumter and brought on the
great war.No doubt this feeling, which pervaded the army, will account in
part for the reckless dealing with the inhabitants by the Federal
soldiery.The superior officers, however, made a sincere effort to
restrain lawlessness.On February 17th, Sherman entered Columbia, the mayor having come out and
surrendered the city.The Fifteenth Corps marched through the city and out
on the Camden road, the remainder of the army not having come within two
miles of the city.The conflagration
spread and ere the coming of the morning the best part of the city had
been laid in ashes.Before Sherman left Columbia he destroyed the machine-shops and everything
else which might aid the Confederacy.He left with the mayor one hundred
stand of arms with which to keep order, and five hundred head of cattle
for the destitute.As Columbia was approached by the Federals, the occupation of Charleston
by the Confederates became more and more untenable.In vain had the
governor of South Carolina pleaded with President Davis to reenforce
General Hardee, who occupied the city.Hardee thereupon evacuated the
historic old city--much of which was burned, whether by design or accident
is not known--and its defenses, including Fort Sumter, the bombardment of
which, nearly four years before, had precipitated the mighty conflict,
were occupied by Colonel Bennett, who came over from Morris Island.On March 11th, Sherman reached Fayetteville, North Carolina, where he
destroyed a fine arsenal.Hitherto, Sherman's march, except for the
annoyance of Wheeler's cavalry, had been but slightly impeded by the
Confederates.General Joseph B.
Johnston, his old foe of Resaca and Kenesaw Mountain, had been recalled
and was now in command of the troops in the Carolinas.No longer would the
streams and the swamps furnish the only resistance to the progress of the
Union army.The first engagement came at Averysboro on March 16th.General Hardee,
having taken a strong position, made a determined stand; but a division of
Slocum's wing, aided by Kilpatrick, soon put him to flight, with the loss
of several guns and over two hundred prisoners.The battle of Bentonville, which took place three days after that of
Averysboro, was more serious.Johnston had placed his whole army, probably
thirty-five thousand men, in the form of a V, the sides embracing the
village of Bentonville.Slocum engaged the Confederates while Howard was
hurried to the scene.On two days, the 19th and 20th of March, Sherman's
army fought its last battle in the Civil War.But Johnston, after making
several attacks, resulting in considerable losses on both sides, withdrew
his army during the night, and the Union army moved to Goldsboro.The
losses at Bentonville were: Federal, 1,527; Confederate, 2,606.At Goldsboro the Union army was reenforced by its junction with Schofield,
who had come out of the West with over twenty-two thousand men from the
army of Thomas in Tennessee.Sherman's third great march was practically over.As to the relative
importance of the second and third, Sherman declares in his memoirs, he
would place that from Atlanta to the sea at one, and that from Savannah
through the Carolinas at ten.Leaving his army in charge of Schofield, Sherman went to City Point, in
Virginia, where he had a conference with General Grant and President
Lincoln, and plans for the final campaign were definitely arranged.He
returned to Goldsboro late in March, and, pursuing Johnston, received,
finally, on April 26th the surrender of his army.[Illustration: BEFORE THE MARCH TO THE SEA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]These two photographs of General Sherman were taken in 1864--the year that
made him an international figure, before his march to the sea which
electrified the civilized world, and exposed once for all the crippled
condition of the Confederacy.After that autumn expedition, the problem of
the Union generals was merely to contend with detached armies, no longer
with the combined States of the Confederacy.The latter had no means of
extending further support to the dwindling troops in the field.Sherman
was the chief Union exponent of the tactical gift that makes marches count
as much as fighting.In the early part of 1864 he made his famous raid
across Mississippi from Jackson to Meridian and back again, destroying the
railroads, Confederate stores, and other property, and desolating the
country along the line of march.In May he set out from Chattanooga for
the invasion of Georgia.For his success in this campaign he was
appointed, on August 12th, a major-general in the regular army.On
November 12th, he started with the pick of his men on his march to the
sea.After the capture of Savannah, December 21st, Sherman's fame was
secure; yet he was one of the most heartily execrated leaders of the war.There is a hint of a smile in the right-hand picture.The left-hand
portrait reveals all the sternness and determination of a leader
surrounded by dangers, about to penetrate an enemy's country against the
advice of accepted military authorities.[Illustration: THE ATLANTA BANK BEFORE THE MARCH TO THE SEA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]As this photograph was taken, the wagons stood in the street of Atlanta
ready to accompany the Federals in their impending march to the sea.The
most interesting thing is the bank building on the corner, completely
destroyed, although around it stand the stores of merchants entirely
untouched.Evidently there had been here faithful execution of Sherman's
orders to his engineers--to destroy all buildings and property of a public
nature, such as factories, foundries, railroad stations, and the like; but
to protect as far as possible strictly private dwellings and enterprises.Those of a later generation who witnessed the growth of Atlanta within
less than half a century after this photograph was taken, and saw tall
office-buildings and streets humming with industry around the location in
this photograph, will find in it an added fascination.[Illustration: "TUNING UP"--A DAILY DRILL IN THE CAPTURED FORT

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Here Sherman's men are seen at daily drill in Atlanta.This photograph has
an interest beyond most war pictures, for it gives a clear idea of the
soldierly bearing of the men that were to march to the sea.There was an
easy carelessness in their appearance copied from their great commander,
but they were never allowed to become slouchy.Sherman was the antithesis
of a martinet, but he had, in the Atlanta campaign, molded his army into
the "mobile machine" that he desired it to be, and he was anxious to keep
the men up to this high pitch of efficiency for the performance of still
greater deeds.No better disciplined army existed in the world at the time
Sherman's "<DW15>s" set out for the sea.[Illustration: CUTTING LOOSE FROM THE BASE, NOVEMBER 12th

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB."On the 12th of November the railroad and telegraph communications with
the rear were broken and the army stood detached from all friends,
dependent on its own resources and supplies," writes Sherman.Meanwhile
all detachments were marching rapidly to Atlanta with orders to break up
the railroad en route and "generally to so damage the country as to make
it untenable to the enemy."Sherman, in
a home letter written from Grand Gulf, Mississippi, May 6, 1863, stated
clearly his views regarding the destruction of property.Speaking of the
wanton havoc wrought on a fine plantation in the path of the army, he
added: "It is done, of course, by the accursed stragglers who won't fight
but hang behind and disgrace our cause and country.Bowie had fled,
leaving everything on the approach of our troops.Of course, devastation
marked the whole path of the army, and I know all the principal officers
detest the infamous practice as much as I do.Of course, I expect and do
take corn, bacon, ham, mules, and everything to support an army, and don't
object much to the using of fences for firewood, but this universal
burning and wanton destruction of private property is not justified in
war."[Illustration: THE BUSTLE OF DEPARTURE FROM ATLANTA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Sherman's men worked like beavers during their last few days in Atlanta.There was no time to be lost; the army was gotten under way with that
precision which marked all Sherman's movements.In the upper picture,
finishing touches are being put to the railroad, and in the lower is seen
the short work that was made of such public buildings as might be of the
slightest use in case the Confederates should recapture the town.As far
back as Chattanooga, while plans for the Atlanta campaign were being
formed, Sherman had been revolving a subsequent march to the sea in case
he was successful.He had not then made up his mind whether it should be
in the direction of Mobile or Savannah, but his Meridian campaign, in
Mississippi, had convinced him that the march was entirely feasible, and
gradually he worked out in his mind its masterly details.At seven in the
morning on November 16th, Sherman rode out along the Decatur road, passed
his marching troops, and near the spot where his beloved McPherson had
fallen, paused for a last look at the city."Behind us," he says, "lay
Atlanta, smouldering and in ruins, the black smoke rising high in air and
hanging like a pall over the ruined city."All about could be seen the
glistening gun-barrels and white-topped wagons, "and the men marching
steadily and rapidly with a cheery look and swinging pace."Some
regimental band struck up "John Brown," and the thousands of voices of the
vast army joined with a mighty chorus in song.A feeling of exhilaration
pervaded the troops.This marching into the unknown held for them the
allurement of adventure, as none but Sherman knew their destination.But
as he worked his way past them on the road, many a group called out,
"Uncle Billy, I guess Grant is waiting for us at Richmond."The
devil-may-care spirit of the troops brought to Sherman's mind grave
thoughts of his own responsibility.He knew that success would be regarded
as a matter of course, but should he fail the march would be set down as
"the wild adventure of a crazy fool."He had no intention of marching
directly to Richmond, but from the first his objective was the seacoast,
at Savannah or Port Royal, or even Pensacola, Florida.[Illustration: RUINS IN ATLANTA]

Federals from the abandoned fortifications, which had been equipped
entirely with field artillery, such as these.It was an extremely useful
capture for Sherman's army, whose supply of artillery had been somewhat
limited during the siege, and still further reduced by the necessity to
fortify Atlanta.On the march to the sea Sherman took with him only
sixty-five field-pieces.The <DW64> refugees in the lower picture recall an
embarrassment of the march to the sea."<DW64>s of all sizes" flocked in
the army's path and stayed there, a picturesque procession, holding
tightly to the skirts of the army which they believed had come for the
sole purpose of setting them free.The cavalcade of <DW64>s soon became so
numerous that Sherman became anxious for his army's sustenance, and
finding an old gray-haired black at Covington, Sherman explained to him
carefully that if the <DW64>s continued to swarm after the army it would
fail in its purpose and they would not get their freedom.Sherman believed
that the old man spread this news to the slaves along the line of march,
and in part saved the army from being overwhelmed by the contrabands.[Illustration: <DW64>s FLOCKING IN THE ARMY'S PATH

The task of General Hardee in defending Savannah was one of peculiar
difficulty.He had only eighteen thousand men, and he was uncertain where
Sherman would strike.Some supposed that Sherman would move at once upon
Charleston, but Hardee argued that the Union army would have to establish
a new base of supplies on the seacoast before attempting to cross the
numerous deep rivers and swamps of South Carolina.Hardee's task therefore
was to hold Savannah just as long as possible, and then to withdraw
northward to unite with the troops which General Bragg was assembling, and
with the detachments scattered at this time over the Carolinas.In
protecting his position around Savannah, Fort McAllister was of prime
importance, since it commanded the Great Ogeechee River in such a way as
to prevent the approach of the Federal fleet, Sherman's dependence for
supplies.It was accordingly manned by a force of two hundred under
command of Major G. W. Anderson, provided with fifty days' rations for use
in case the work became isolated.About
noon of December 13th, Major Anderson's men saw troops in blue moving
about in the woods.The artillery on the land side
of the fort was turned upon them as they advanced from one position to
another, and sharpshooters picked off some of their officers.At half-past
four o'clock, however, the long-expected charge was made from three
different directions, so that the defenders, too few in number to hold the
whole line, were soon overpowered.Hardee now had to consider more
narrowly the best time for withdrawing from the lines at Savannah.[Illustration: FORT McALLISTER--THE LAST BARRIER TO THE SEA

any other city near the Atlantic seaboard.Stretching to the north, east,
and southward lay swamps and morasses through which ran the river-approach
of twelve miles to the town.Innumerable small creeks separated the
marshes into islands over which it was out of the question for an army to
march without first building roads and bridging miles of waterways.The
Federal fleet had for months been on the blockade off the mouth of the
river, and Savannah had been closed to blockade runners since the fall of
Fort Pulaski in April, 1862.But obstructions and powerful batteries held
the river, and Fort McAllister, ten miles to the south, on the Ogeechee,
still held the city safe in its guardianship.[Illustration: FORT McALLISTER, THAT HELD THE FLEET AT BAY

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: THE FIFTEEN MINUTES' FIGHT

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Across these ditches at Fort McAllister, through entangling abatis, over
palisading, the Federals had to fight every inch of their way against the
Confederate garrison up to the very doors of their bomb-proofs, before the
defenders yielded on December 13th.Sherman had at once perceived that the
position could be carried only by a land assault.The fort was strongly
protected by ditches, palisades, and plentiful abatis; marshes and streams
covered its flanks, but Sherman's troops knew that shoes and clothing and
abundant rations were waiting for them just beyond it, and had any of them
been asked if they could take the fort their reply would have been in the
words of the poem: "Ain't we simply got to take it?"Sherman selected for
the honor of the assault General Hazen's second division of the Fifteenth
Corps, the same which he himself had commanded at Shiloh and Vicksburg.Gaily the troops crossed the bridge on the morning of the 13th.Sherman
was watching anxiously through his glass late in the afternoon when a
Federal steamer came up the river and signaled the query: "Is Fort
McAllister taken?"To which Sherman sent reply: "Not yet, but it will be
in a minute."At that instant Sherman saw Hazen's troops emerge from the
woods before the fort, "the lines dressed as on parade, with colors
flying."Immediately dense clouds of smoke belching from the fort
enveloped the Federals.There was a pause; the smoke cleared away, and,
says Sherman, "the parapets were blue with our men."[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: A BIG GUN AT FORT McALLISTER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Fort McAllister is at last in complete possession of the Federals, and a
group of the men who had charged over these ramparts has arranged itself
before the camera as if in the very act of firing the great gun that
points seaward across the marshes, toward Ossabaw Sound.There is one very
peculiar thing proved by this photograph--the gun itself is almost in a
fixed position as regards range and sweep of fire.Instead of the
elevating screw to raise or depress the muzzle, there has been substituted
a block of wood wedged with a heavy spike, and the narrow pit in which the
gun carriage is sunk admits of it being turned but a foot or so to right
or left.It evidently controlled one critical point in the river, but
could not have been used in lending any aid to the repelling of General
Hazen's attack.The officer pointing with outstretched arm is indicating
the very spot at which a shell fired from his gun would fall.The men in
the trench are artillerymen of General Hazen's division of the Fifteenth
Corps; their appearance in their fine uniforms, polished breastplates and
buttons, proves that Sherman's men could not have presented the ragged
appearance that they are often pictured as doing in the war-time sketches.That Army and Navy have come together is proved also by the figure of a
marine from the fleet, who is standing at "Attention" just above the
breach of the gun.Next, leaning on his saber, is a cavalryman, in short
jacket and chin-strap.[Illustration: THE SPOILS OF VICTORY]

THE TROOPS THAT MARCHED TO THE SEA BECOME DAY-LABORERS

Here are the men that marched to the sea doing their turn as day-laborers,
gleefully trundling their wheelbarrows, gathering up everything of value
in Fort McAllister to swell the size of Sherman's "Christmas present."Brigadier-General W. B. Hazen, after his men had successfully stormed the
stubbornly defended fort, reported the capture of twenty-four pieces of
ordnance, with their equipment, forty tons of ammunition, a month's supply
of food for the garrison, and the small arms of the command.In the upper
picture the army engineers are busily at work removing a great 48-pounder
8-inch Columbiad that had so long repelled the Federal fleet.There is
always work enough and to spare for the engineers both before and after
the capture of a fortified position.In the wheelbarrows is a harvest of
shells and torpedoes.These deadly instruments of destruction had been
relied upon by the Confederates to protect the land approach to Fort
McAllister, which was much less strongly defensible on that side than at
the waterfront.While Sherman's army was approaching Savannah one of his
officers had his leg blown off by a torpedo buried in the road and stepped
on by his horse.After that Sherman set a line of Confederate prisoners
across the road to march ahead of the army, and no more torpedoes were
found.After the capture of Fort McAllister the troops set to work
gingerly scraping about wherever the ground seemed to have been disturbed,
trying to find and remove the dangerous hidden menaces to life.At last
the ground was rendered safe and the troops settled down to the occupation
of Fort McAllister where the bravely fighting little Confederate garrison
had held the key to Savannah.The city was the first to fall of the
Confederacy's Atlantic seaports, now almost locked from the outside world
by the blockade.By the capture of Fort McAllister, which crowned the
march to the sea, Sherman had numbered the days of the war.The fall of
the remaining ports was to follow in quick succession, and by Washington's
Birthday, 1865, the entire coast-line was to be in possession of the
Federals.[Illustration: SHERMAN'S TROOPS DISMANTLING FORT McALLISTER]

and hastily pressed into service by the Federal navy to help solve the
problem of patrolling the three thousand miles of coast, along which the
blockade must be made effective.In order to penetrate the intricate
inlets and rivers, light-draft fighting-vessels were required, and the
most immediate means of securing these was to purchase every sort of
merchant craft that could possibly be adapted to the purposes of war,
either as a fighting-vessel or as a transport.The ferryboat in the
picture has been provided with guns and her pilot-houses armored.A
casemate of iron plates has been provided for the gunners.The Navy
Department purchased and equipped in all one hundred and thirty-six
vessels in 1861, and by the end of the year had increased the number of
seamen in the service from 7,600 to over 22,000.Many of these new
recruits saw their first active service aboard the converted ferryboats,
tugboats, and other frail and unfamiliar vessels making up the nondescript
fleet that undertook to cut off the commerce of the South.The experience
thus gained under very unusual circumstances placed them of necessity
among the bravest sailors of the navy.[Illustration: THE LAST PORT CLOSED

time--fifty-five ships of war, including five ironclads, altogether
carrying six hundred guns.The upper picture shows the nature of the

catch a blockade-runner, and as the Federal navy captured ship after ship
of this character they began to acquire a numerous fleet of swift steamers
from which it was difficult for any vessel to get away.The "Vance"
brought many a cargo to the hungry Southern ports, slipping safely by the
blockading fleet and back again till her shrewd Captain Willie felt that
he could give the slip to anything afloat.On her last trip she had safely
gotten by the Federal vessels lying off the harbor of Wilmington, North
Carolina, and was dancing gleefully on her way with a bountiful cargo of
cotton and turpentine when, on September 10, 1864, in latitude 34 deg.W., a vessel was sighted which rapidly bore down upon
her.It proved to be the "Santiago de Cuba," Captain O. S. Glisson.The
rapidity with which the approaching vessel overhauled him was enough to
convince Captain Willie that she was in his own class.The "Santiago de
Cuba" carried eleven guns, and the "Vance" humbly hove to, to receive the
prize-crew which took her to Boston, where she was condemned.In the
picture we see her lying high out of the water, her valuable cargo having
been removed and sold to enrich by prize-money the officers and men of her
fleet captor.[Illustration: A GREYHOUND CAUGHT--WRECK OF THE BLOCKADE-RUNNER "COLT"]

The wreck of this blockade-runner, the "Colt," lies off Sullivan's Island,
Charleston Harbor, in 1865.The coast of the Carolinas, before the war was
over, was strewn with just such sights as this.The bones of former
"greyhounds" became landmarks by which the still uncaptured
blockade-runners could get their bearings and lay a course to safety.If
one of these vessels were cut off from making port and surrounded by
Federal pursuers, the next best thing was to run her ashore in shallow
water, where the gunboats could not follow and where her valuable cargo
could be secured by the Confederates.A single cargo at war-time prices
was enough to pay more than the cost of the vessel.Regular auctions were
held in Charleston or Wilmington, where prices for goods not needed by the
Confederate Government were run up to fabulous figures.The business of
blockade-running was well organized abroad, especially in England.One
successful trip was enough to start the enterprise with a handsome profit.A blockade-runner like the "Kate," which made forty trips or more, would
enrich her owners almost beyond the dreams of avarice.[Illustration: THE CONFEDERATE RAM "STONEWALL"]

Here are two striking views in the Port Royal dry-dock of the Confederate
ram "Stonewall."When this powerful fighting-ship sailed from Copenhagen,
Jan.T. J. Page, C. S. N., the Federal
navy became confronted by its most formidable antagonist during the war.In March, 1863, the Confederacy had negotiated a loan of L3,000,000, and
being thus at last in possession of the necessary funds, Captain Bulloch
and Mr.Slidell arranged with M. Arman, who was a member of the
_Corps-Legislatif_ and proprietor of a large shipyard at Bordeaux, for the
construction of ironclad ships of war.Slidell had already received
assurances from persons in the confidence of Napoleon III that the
building of the ships in the French yards would not be interfered with,
and that getting them to sea would be connived at by the Government.Owing
to the indubitable proof laid before the Emperor by the Federal diplomats
at Paris, he was compelled to revoke the guarantee that had been given to
Slidell and Bulloch.A plan was arranged, however, by which M. Arman
should sell the vessels to various European powers; and he disposed of the
ironclad ram "Sphinx" to the Danish Government, then at war with Prussia.Delivery of the ship at Copenhagen was not made, however, till after the
war had ceased, and no trouble was experienced by the Confederates in
arranging for the purchase of the vessel.On January 24, 1865, she
rendezvoused off Quiberon, on the French coast; the remainder of her
officers, crew, and supplies were put aboard of her; the Confederate flag
was hoisted over her, and she was christened the "Stonewall."Already the
vessel was discovered to have sprung a leak, and Captain Page ran into
Ferrol, Spain.Here dock-yard facilities were at first granted, but were
withdrawn at the protest of the American Minister.While Captain Page was
repairing his vessel as best he could, the "Niagara" and the "Sacramento"
appeared, and after some weeks the "Stonewall" offered battle in vain.[Illustration]

THE LAST INVASION OF TENNESSEE--FRANKLIN--NASHVILLE


In the latter days of September, 1864, the Confederate Army of Tennessee
lay in the vicinity of Macon, Georgia.It was a dispirited body of men,
homesick and discouraged.For four long months, first under one leader and
then under another, it had opposed, step by step, Sherman's advance toward
Atlanta, and now that important strategic point was in the hands of the
Federal forces.About the middle of July the President of the Confederacy
had seen fit to remove Joseph E. Johnston from the command and replace him
with John B. Hood.The latter's habit of mind and methods of action led
the Richmond authorities to believe that he would proceed very differently
from Johnston, and in this he did not disappoint them.The results showed
that Johnston's Fabian policy was by far the better one under the
circumstances.Sherman had the stronger army, but he was compelled
constantly to detach portions of it in order to guard his lengthening line
of supplies.The one thing he desired most was that his opponent should
assume an aggressive attitude.Hood's idea was precipitation rather than
patience, and in consequence on the 2d of September General Slocum entered
the coveted city.On the 22d of that month President Davis visited the Southern Army, and
made a memorable address to the troops.He promised them--and they were
delighted at the news--that they would soon be back in Tennessee, for a
fresh invasion of that State had been planned.This would, declared the
speaker, place Sherman in a worse predicament than that in which Napoleon
found himself at Moscow.But the Federal general had at least the
advantage of learning what was going to happen to him, for the President's
words were reported verbatim in the Southern papers, and he prepared to
meet his antagonists.Thomas, with the Army of the Cumberland, was sent to
Nashville while Schofield, with his smaller force known as the Army of the
Ohio, returned to Knoxville where he had spent the previous winter, to
await Hood's advance.By the 1st of October the latter was across the
Chattahoochee in the hope of drawing Sherman from Atlanta.There was a
brave fight at Allatoona where General Corse "held the fort," but Sherman,
although he followed the Confederate army, was unable to bring on a
general engagement.His great plan of a march through Georgia to the sea was now fully formed
in his mind.He had not yet obtained Grant's sanction to the scheme, but
he ordered Schofield to cooperate with Thomas and sent the Fourth Corps as
further assistance.He himself ceased the pursuit of Hood at Gaylesville
and turned back to Atlanta, confident that the fate of Tennessee was safe
in the hands of his ablest lieutenant, George H. Thomas.Hood appeared on
the 26th of October at Decatur on the south bank of the Tennessee River.Lack of supplies had delayed his advance, but even so his performances had
greatly alarmed the North.Twice had he interposed between Sherman and the
Federal base and had destroyed many miles of railway, but what in other
circumstances would have placed the Union leader in a dangerous
predicament was now of little moment, since the latter was rapidly making
preparations to cut himself off from all communication with the source of
his supplies.It was necessary that Hood should have the assistance of
Forrest, whose dauntless cavalry had been playing great havoc with the
Federal stores in western Tennessee, so he moved to Florence before
crossing the river, and here Forrest joined him on November 14th.In the
meantime, Schofield, with about twenty-eight thousand men, had reached
Pulaski on the way to encounter the Southern advance.Now began a series of brilliant strategic moves, kept up for a fortnight
before the two small armies--they were of almost equal strength met in
one awful clash.Hood's efforts were bent toward cutting Schofield off
from Thomas at Nashville.There was a mad race for the Duck River, and the
Federals got over at Columbia in the very nick of time.The Southern
leader, by a skilful piece of strategy and a forced march, pushed on to
Spring Hill ahead of his opponent.He was in an excellent position to
annihilate General Stanley who was in advance, and then crush the
remainder of the Federals who were moving with the slow wagon-trains.But
owing to a number of strange mishaps, which brought forth much
recrimination but no satisfactory explanation, the Union army slipped by
with little damage and entrenched itself at Franklin on the Harpeth River.Of all the dark days of Confederate history--and they were many--the 29th
of November, 1864, has been mourned as that of "lost opportunities."Schofield did not expect, or desire, a battle at Franklin, but he was
treated to one the following afternoon when the Confederates came up, and
it was of the most severe nature.The first attack was made as the light
began to wane, and the Federal troops stood their ground although the
orders had been to withdraw, because through some blunder two brigades in
blue had been stationed, unsupported, directly in front of Hood's
approach.The stubborn resistance of Schofield's army only increased the
ardor of the opponents.It is said that thirteen separate assaults were
made upon the Union entrenchments, and the fearful carnage was finally
carried into the streets and among the dooryards of the little town.At
nine o'clock the fury of the iron storm was quelled.Five Confederate
generals, including the gallant Cleburne, lay dead upon the field.In two
of the Southern brigades all the general officers were either killed or
wounded.Hood's loss was about sixty-three hundred, nearly three times
that of Schofield.By midnight the latter was on his way, uninterrupted,
to Nashville.Meanwhile Thomas was performing a herculean task within the
fortifications of that capital city.He had received a large number of
raw recruits and a motley collection of troops from garrisons in the West.These had to be drilled into an efficient army, and not one move to fight
would Thomas make until this had been done.Grant, in Virginia, grew
impatient and the Northern papers clamored for an attack on Hood, who had
now arrived with thirty-eight thousand men before the city.Finally Grant
took action, and General Logan was hurrying to assume the Federal command.But by the time he reached Louisville there was no need for his services.Thomas had for some days been ready with his force of forty-five thousand,
but to increase the difficulties of his position, a severe storm of
freezing rain made action impossible until the morning of December 15th.The Union lines of defense were in a semi-circle and Hood was on the
southeast, lightly entrenched.The first assault on his right wing
followed by one on his left, forced the Confederates back to a second
position two miles to the south, and that was the first day's work.Hood
had detached a part of his forces and he did all he could to gain time
until he might recover his full strength.But he had respite only until
Thomas was ready on the morrow, which was about noon.The Union army
deployed in front of the Southerners and overlapped their left wing.An
attack on the front was bravely met and repulsed by the Confederates, and
the Federal leader, extending his right, compelled his opponent to stretch
his own lines more and more.Finally they broke just to the left of the
center, and a general forward movement on the Union side ended in the
utter rout of the splendid and courageous Army of Tennessee.It melted away in disorder; the pursuit was vigorous, and only a small
portion reassembled at Columbia and fell back with a poor show of order
behind the Tennessee.Many military historians have seen in the battle of Nashville the most
crushing defeat of the war.Certainly no other brought such complete ruin
upon a large and well-organized body of troops.[Illustration: RUSHING A FEDERAL BATTERY OUT OF JOHNSONVILLE

frightened into panic and flight when the bold Confederate raider,
Forrest, appeared on the west bank of the river and began a noisy
cannonade.The day after the photograph was taken (November 23d) the
encampment in the picture was broken.[Illustration: FORT NEGLEY, LOOKING TOWARD THE CONFEDERATE CENTER AND

THE SIEGE AND FALL OF PETERSBURG

    It is not improbable that Grant might have made more headway by
    leaving a sufficient part of his army in the trenches in front of
    Petersburg and by moving with a heavy force far to the west upon Lee's
    communications; or, if it were determined to capture the place _a main
    forte_, by making a massed attack upon some point in the center after
    suitable mining operations had weakened Lee's defenses and prepared
    for such an operation.But the end was to come with opening spring.To
    the far-sighted, this was no longer doubtful.The South must succumb
    to the greater material resources of the North, despite its courage
    and its sacrifices.--_Colonel T. A. Dodge, U. S. A., in "A Bird's-Eye
    View of Our Civil War."_


During the winter of 1864-65, General Lee, fighting Grant without, was
fighting famine within.The shivering, half-clad soldiers of the South
crouched over feeble fires in their entrenchments.The men were exposed to
the rain, snow, and sleet; sickness and disease soon added their horrors
to the desolation.The
life of the Confederacy was ebbing fast.Behind Union breastworks, early in 1865, General Grant was making
preparations for the opening of a determined campaign with the coming of
spring.Mile after mile had been added to his entrenchments, and they now
extended to Hatcher's Run on the left.The Confederate lines had been
stretched until they were so thin that there was constant danger of
breaking.A. P. Hill was posted on the right; Gordon and Anderson held the
center, and Longstreet was on the left.Union troops were mobilizing in
front of Petersburg.By February 1st, Sherman was fairly off from Savannah
on his northward march to join Grant.He was weak in cavalry and Grant
determined to bring Sheridan from the Shenandoah, whence the bulk of
Early's forces had been withdrawn, and send him to assist Sherman.Sheridan left Winchester February 27th, wreaking much destruction as he
advanced, but circumstances compelled him to seek a new base at White
House.On March 27th he formed a junction with the armies of the Potomac
and the James.Such were the happenings that prompted Lee to prepare for
the evacuation of Petersburg.And he might be able, in his rapid marches,
to outdistance Grant, join his forces with those of Johnston, fall on
Sherman, destroy one wing of the Union army and arouse the hopes of his
soldiers, and prolong the life of his Government.General Grant knew the condition of Lee's army and, with the unerring
instinct of a military leader, surmised what the plan of the Southern
general must be.He decided to move on the left, destroy both the Danville
and South Side railroads, and put his army in better condition to pursue.General Lee, in order to get Grant to look another way for a while,
decided to attack Grant's line on the right, and gain some of the works.This would compel Grant to draw some of his force from his left and secure
a way of escape to the west.This bold plan was left for execution to the
gallant Georgian, General John B. Gordon, who had successfully led the
reverse attack at Cedar Creek, in the Shenandoah, in October, 1864.Near
the crater stood Fort Stedman.Between it and the Confederate front, a
distance of about one hundred and fifty yards, was a strip of firm earth,
in full view of both picket lines.Across this space some deserters had
passed to the Union entrenchments.General Gordon took advantage of this
fact and accordingly selected his men, who, at the sound of the signal
gun, should disarm the Federal pickets, while fifty more men were to cross
the open space quickly with axes and cut away the abatis, and three
hundred others were to rush through the opening, and capture the fort and
guns.At four o'clock on the morning of March 25, 1865, Gordon had everything in
readiness.His chosen band wore white strips of cloth across the breast,
that they might distinguish each other in the hand-to-hand fight that
would doubtless ensue.Behind these men half of Lee's army was massed to
support the attack.In the silence of the early morning, a gunshot rang
out from the Confederate works.Not a Federal picket-shot was heard.The
axemen rushed across the open and soon the thuds of their axes told of the
cutting away of the abatis.The three hundred surged through the entrance,
overpowered the gunners, captured batteries to the right and to the left,
and were in control of the situation.Gordon's corps of about five
thousand was on hand to sustain the attack but the remaining reserves,
through failure of the guides, did not come, and the general found himself
cut off with a rapidly increasing army surrounding him.Fort Haskell, on the left, began to throw its shells.Under its cover,
heavy columns of Federals sent by General Parke, now commanding the Ninth
Corps, pressed forward.The Confederates resisted the charge, and from the
captured Fort Stedman and the adjoining batteries poured volley after
volley on Willcox's advancing lines of blue.The Northerners fell back,
only to re-form and renew the attack.This time they secured a footing,
and for twenty minutes the fighting was terrific.Then across the brow of the hill swept the command of Hartranft.The furious musketry, and
artillery directed by General Tidball, shrivelled up the ranks of Gordon
until they fled from the fort and its neighboring batteries in the midst
of withering fire, and those who did not were captured.This was the last
aggressive effort of the expiring Confederacy in front of Petersburg, and
it cost three thousand men.The affair at Fort Stedman did not turn Grant from his plans against the
Confederate right.With the railroads here destroyed, Richmond would be
completely cut off.On the morning of the 29th, as previously arranged,
the movement began.Sheridan swept to the south with his cavalry, as if he
were to fall upon the railroads.General Warren, with fifteen thousand
men, was working his way through the tangled woods and low swamps in the
direction of Lee's right.At the same time, Lee stripped his entrenchments
at Petersburg as much as he dared and hurried General Anderson, with
infantry, and Fitzhugh Lee, with cavalry, forward to hold the roads over
which he hoped to escape.On Friday morning, March 31st, the opposing
forces, the Confederates much reenforced, found themselves at Dinwiddie
Court House.The woods and swamps prevented the formation of a regular
line of battle.Lee made his accustomed flank movement, with heavy loss to
the Federals as they tried to move in the swampy forests.The Northerners
finally were ready to advance when it was found that Lee had fallen back.During the day and night, reenforcements were coming in from all sides.The Confederates had taken their position at Five Forks.Early the next afternoon, the 1st of April, Sheridan, reenforced by
Warren, was arranging his troops for battle.The day was nearly spent when
all was in readiness.The sun was not more than two hours high when the
Northern army moved toward that of the South, defended by a breastwork
behind a dense undergrowth of pines.Through this mass of timber the
Federals crept with bayonets fixed.They charged upon the Confederates,
but, at the same time, a galling fire poured into them from the left,
spreading dismay and destruction in their midst.The intrepid Sheridan
urged his black battle-charger, the famous Rienzi, now known as
Winchester, up and down the lines, cheering his men on in the fight.He
seemed to be everywhere at once.The Confederate left was streaming down
the White Oak Road.But General Crawford had reached a cross-road, by
taking a circuitous route, and the Southern army was thus shut off from
retreat.The Federal cavalry had dismounted and was doing its full share
of work.The Confederates soon found themselves trapped, and the part of
their army in action that day was nearly annihilated.With night came the news of the crushing blow to Lee.General Grant was
seated by his camp-fire surrounded by his staff, when a courier dashed
into his presence with the message of victory.Soon from every great gun
along the Union line belched forth the sheets of flame.The earth shook
with the awful cannonade.Mortar shells made huge parabolas through the
air.The Union batteries crept closer and closer to the Confederate lines
and the balls crashed into the streets of the doomed city.At dawn of the 2nd of April the grand assault began.The Federal troops
sprang forward with a rush.Despite the storms of grape and canister, the
Sixth Corps plunged through the battery smoke, and across the walls,
pushing the brave defenders to the inner works.The whole corps penetrated
the lines and swept everything before it toward Hatcher's Run.Some of the
troops even reached the South Side Railroad, where the brave General A. P.
Hill fell mortally wounded.Everywhere, the blue masses poured into the works.General Ord, on the
right of the Sixth Corps, helped to shut the Confederate right into the
city.General Parke, with the Ninth Corps, carried the main line.The thin
gray line could no longer stem the tide that was engulfing it.The
Confederate troops south of Hatcher's Run fled to the west, and fought
General Miles until General Sheridan and a division from Meade appeared on
the scene.By noon the Federals held the line of the outer works from Fort
Gregg to the Appomattox.The last stronghold carried was Fort Gregg, at
which the men of Gibbon's corps had one of the most desperate struggles of
the war.The Confederates now fell back to the inner fortifications and
the siege of Petersburg came to an end.[Illustration: A BATTERED RELIC OF COLONIAL DAYS IN PETERSBURG

the visitation of the falling shells fit habitations for mankind.Many of

certain localities suffered more than others, and those residents who
seemed to dwell in the safest zones had been ever ready to open their
houses to the sick and wounded of Lee's army.As Grant's troops marched
in, many pale faces gazed out at them from the windows, and at the
doorsteps stood men whose wounds exempted them from ever bearing arms

Federals, returning the compliment, had dubbed "Fort Damnation."Between

were continual occurrences after dark.In stealthy sorties one side or the

Appomattox.Those shown in this picture were in front of the entrenchments

time, Lee entrusted the last desperate effort to break through the
tightening Federal lines, March 25, 1865.Lee was confronted by the
dilemma of either being starved out of Petersburg and Richmond, or of
getting out himself and uniting his army to that of Johnston in North
Carolina to crush Sherman before Grant could reach him.Gordon was to
begin this latter, almost impossible, task by an attack on Fort Stedman,
which the Confederates believed to be the weakest point in the Federal
fortifications.The position had been captured from them in the beginning,
and they knew that the nature of the ground and its nearness to their own
lines had made it difficult to strengthen it very much.It was planned to
surprise the fort before daylight.Below are seen the rabbit-like burrows
of Gracie's Salient, past which Gordon led his famished men.When the
order came to go forward, they did not flinch, but hurled themselves
bravely against fortifications far stronger than their own.Three columns
of a hundred picked men each moved down the <DW72> shown on the left and
advanced in the darkness against Stedman.They were to be followed by a
division.Through the gap which the storming parties were expected to open
in the Federal lines, Gordon's columns would rush in both directions and a
cavalry force was to sweep on and destroy the pontoon bridges across the
Appomattox and to raid City Point, breaking up the Federal base.It was no
light task, for although Fort Stedman itself was weak, it was flanked by
Battery No.An
attacking party on the right would be exposed to an enfilading fire in
crossing the plain; while on the left the approach was difficult be cause
of ravines, one of which the Confederate engineers had turned into a pond
by damming a creek.All night long General Gordon's wife, with the brave
women of Petersburg, sat up tearing strips of white cloth, to be tied on
the arms of the men in the storming parties so that they could tell friend
from foe in the darkness and confusion of the assault.Before the
sleep-dazed Federals could offer effective resistance, Gordon's men had
possession of the fort and the batteries.Only after one of the severest
engagements of the siege were the Confederates driven back.[Illustration: GRACIE'S SALIENT--AFTER GORDON'S FORLORN HOPE HAD CHARGED]


APRIL SECOND--"THIS IS A SAD BUSINESS"

As his general watched, this boy fought to stem the Federal rush--but
fell, his breast pierced by a bayonet, in the trenches of Fort Mahone.It
is heart-rending to look at a picture such as this; it is sad to think of
it and to write about it.Here is a boy of only fourteen years, his face
innocent of a razor, his feet unshod and stockingless in the bitter April
weather.It is to be hoped that the man who slew him has forgotten it, for
this face would haunt him surely.Many who fought in the blue ranks were
young, but in the South there were whole companies made up of such boys as
this.At the battle of Newmarket the scholars of the Virgina Military
Institute, the eldest seventeen and the youngest twelve, marched from the
classrooms under arms, joined the forces of General Breckinridge, and
aided by their historic charge to gain a brilliant victory over the
Federal General Sigel.The never-give-in spirit was implanted in the youth
of the Confederacy, as well as in the hearts of the grizzled veterans.Lee
had inspired them, but in addition to this inspiration, as General Gordon
writes, "every man of them was supported by their extraordinary
consecration, resulting from the conviction that he was fighting in the
defense of home and the rights of his State.Hence their unfaltering faith
in the justice of the cause, their fortitude in the extremest privations,
their readiness to stand shoeless and shivering in the trenches at night
and to face any danger at their leader's call."[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.APPOMATTOX

    I now come to what I have always regarded--shall ever regard--as the
    most creditable episode in all American history--an episode without a
    blemish, imposing, dignified, simple, heroic.Two men met that day, representative of American civilization, the
    whole world looking on.The two were Grant and Lee--types each.Both
    rose, and rose unconsciously, to the full height of the occasion--and
    than that occasion there has been none greater.About it, and them,
    there was no theatrical display, no self-consciousness, no effort at
    effect.A great crisis was to be met; and they met that crisis as
    great countrymen should.Consider the possibilities; think for a
    moment of what that day might have been; you will then see cause to
    thank God for much.--_General Charles Francis Adams, U. S. V., in Phi
    Beta Kappa Address delivered at the University of Chicago, June 17,
    1902._


We are now to witness the closing scene of one of the greatest tragedies
ever enacted on the world's stage.Many and varied had been the scenes
during the war; the actors and their parts had been real.The wounds of
the South were bleeding; the North was awaiting the decisive blow.Fortunes, great and small, had melted away
by the hundreds of millions.In Richmond, the citadel of the waning
Confederacy, the people were starving.The Southern army, half clad and
without food, was but a shadow of its once proud self.Bravely and long
the men in gray had followed their adored leader.Now the limit of
endurance had been reached.It was the second day of April, 1865.Lee realized that after Petersburg
his beloved Richmond must fall.The order was given for the movement to
begin at eight o'clock that night.The darkness of the early morning of
the 3d was suddenly transformed into a lurid light overcasting the
heavens for miles around the famous city whose name had became a
household word over the civilized world.The
capital of the Confederacy, the pride of the South, toward which the Army
of the Potomac had fought its way, leaving a trail of blood for four weary
years, had at last succumbed to the overwhelming power of Grant's
indomitable armies.President Davis had received a despatch while attending services at St.Paul's church, Sunday morning, the 2d, advising him that the city must be
evacuated that night, and, leaving the church at once, he hastened the
preparations for flight with his personal papers and the archives of the
Confederate Government.During that Sabbath day and night Richmond was in
a state of riot.There had been an unwarranted feeling of security in the
city, and the unwelcome news, spreading like an electric flash, was
paralyzing and disastrous in its effect.Prisoners were released from
their toils, a lawless mob overran the thoroughfares, and civic government
was nullified.One explosion after another, on the morning of the 3d, rent
the air with deafening roar, as the magazines took fire.The scene was one
of terror and grandeur.The flames spread to the city from the ships, bridges, and arsenal, which
had been set on fire, and hundreds of buildings, including the best
residential section of the capital of the Confederacy, were destroyed.When the Union army entered the city in the morning, thousands of the
inhabitants, men, women, and children, were gathered at street corners and
in the parks, in wildest confusion.The commissary depot had been broken
open by the starving mob, and rifled of its contents, until the place was
reached by the spreading flames.The Federal soldiers stacked arms, and
heroically battled with the fire, drafting into the work all able-bodied
men found in the city.The invaders extinguished the flames, and soon
restored the city to a state of order and safety.The invalid wife of
General Lee, who was exposed to danger, was furnished with an ambulance
and corporal's guard until the danger was past.President Lincoln, who had visited Grant at Petersburg, entered Richmond
on the 4th of April.He visited President Davis' house, and Libby Prison,
then deserted, and held a conference with prominent citizens and army
officers of the Confederacy.The President seemed deeply concerned and
weighted down with the realization of the great responsibilities that
would fall upon him after the war.Only ten days later the nation was
shaken from ocean to ocean by the tragic news of his assassination.General Lee had started on his last march by eight o'clock on the night of
the 2d.By midnight the evacuation of both Petersburg and Richmond was
completed.For nine months the invincible forces of Lee had kept a foe of
more than twice their numerical strength from invading their stronghold,
and only after a long and harassing siege were they forced to retreat.They saw the burning city as their line of march was illuminated by the
conflagration, and emotions too deep for words overcame them.The woods
and fields, in their fresh, bright colors of spring, were in sharp
contrast to the travel-worn, weather-beaten, ragged veterans passing over
the verdant plain.Lee hastened the march of his troops to Amelia Court
House, where he had ordered supplies, but by mistake the train of supplies
had been sent on to Richmond.This was a crushing blow to the hungry men,
who had been stimulated on their tiresome march by the anticipation of
much-needed food.The fatality of war was now hovering over them like a
huge black specter.General Grant did not proceed to Richmond, but leaving General Weitzel to
invest the city, he hastened in pursuit of Lee to intercept the retreating
army.This pursuit was started early on the 3d.On the evening of that
date there was some firing between the pursuing army and Lee's rear guard.It was Lee's design to concentrate his force at Amelia Court House, but
this was not to be accomplished by the night of the 4th.Not until the 5th
was the whole army up, and then it was discovered that no adequate
supplies were within less than fifty miles.Subsistence could be obtained
only by foraging parties.No word of complaint from the suffering men
reached their commander, and on the evening of that disappointing day they
patiently and silently began the sad march anew.Their course was through
unfavorable territory and necessarily slow.The Federals were gaining upon
their retreating columns.Sheridan's cavalry had reached their flank, and
on the 6th there was heavy skirmishing.In the afternoon the Federals had
arrived in force sufficient to bring on an engagement with Ewell's corps
in the rear, at Sailor's Creek, a tributary of the Appomattox River.Ewell
was surrounded by the Federals and the entire corps captured.General
Anderson, commanding the divisions of Pickett and Johnson, was attacked
and fought bravely, losing many men.In all about six thousand Confederate
soldiers were left in the hands of the pursuing army.On the night of the 6th, the remainder of the Confederate army continued
the retreat and arrived at Farmville, where the men received two days'
rations, the first food except raw or parched corn that had been given
them for two days.Again the tedious journey was resumed, in the hope of
breaking through the rapidly-enmeshing net and forming a junction with
Johnston at Danville, or of gaining the protected region of the mountains
near Lynchburg.But the progress of the weak and weary marchers was slow
and the Federal cavalry had swept around to Lee's front, and a halt was
necessary to check the pursuing Federals.On the evening of the 8th, Lee
reached Appomattox Court House.Here ended the last march of the Army of
Northern Virginia.General Lee and his officers held a council of war on the night of the 8th
and it was decided to make an effort to cut their way through the Union
lines on the morning of the next day.On the 7th, while at Farmville, on
the south side of the Appomattox River, Grant sent to Lee a courteous
request for the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia, based on the
hopelessness of further resistance on the part of that army.In reply, Lee
expressed sympathy with Grant's desire to avoid useless effusion of blood
and asked the terms of surrender.The next morning General Grant replied to Lee, urging that a meeting be
designated by Lee, and specifying the terms of surrender, to which Lee
replied promptly, rejecting those terms, which were, that the Confederates
lay down their arms, and the men and officers be disqualified for taking
up arms against the Government of the United States until properly
exchanged.When Grant read Lee's letter he shook his head in
disappointment and said, "It looks as if Lee still means to fight; I will
reply in the morning."On the 9th Grant addressed another communication to Lee, repeating the
terms of surrender, and closed by saying, "The terms upon which peace can
be had are well understood.By the South laying down their arms they will
hasten that most desirable event, save thousands of human lives, and
hundreds of millions of property not yet destroyed.Sincerely hoping that
all our difficulties may be settled without the loss of another life, I
subscribe myself, etc."There remained for Lee the bare possibility, by desperate fighting, of
breaking through the Federal lines in his rear.To Gordon's corps was
assigned the task of advancing on Sheridan's strongly supported front.Since Pickett's charge at Gettysburg there had been no more hopeless
movement in the annals of the war.It was not merely that Gordon was
overwhelmingly outnumbered by the opposing forces, but his
hunger-enfeebled soldiers, even if successful in the first onslaught,
could count on no effective support, for Longstreet's corps was in even
worse condition than his own.Nevertheless, on the morning of Sunday, the
9th, the attempt was made.Gordon was fighting his corps, as he said, "to
a frazzle," when Lee came at last to a realizing sense of the futility of
it all and ordered a truce.A meeting with Grant was soon arranged on the
basis of the letters already exchanged.The conference of the two
world-famous commanders took place at Appomattox, a small settlement with
only one street, but to be made historic by this meeting.Lee was awaiting
Grant's arrival at the house of Wilmer McLean.It was here, surrounded by
staff-officers, that the terms were written by Grant for the final
surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia.The terms, and their
acceptance, were embodied in the following letters, written and signed in
the famous "brick house" on that memorable Sunday:

    APPOMATTOX COURT HOUSE, VIRGINIA,
    APRIL 9, 1865.GENERAL: In accordance with the substance of my letter to you of the
    8th instant, I propose to receive the surrender of the Army of
    Northern Virginia on the following terms, to wit: Rolls of all the
    officers and men to be made in duplicate, one copy to be given to an
    officer to be designated by me, the other to be retained by such
    officer or officers as you may designate.The officers to give their
    individual paroles not to take up arms against the Government of the
    United States until properly exchanged; and each company or regimental
    commander to sign a like parole for the men of their commands.The
    arms, artillery, and public property to be parked and stacked, and
    turned over to the officers appointed by me to receive them.This will
    not embrace the side-arms of the officers, nor their private horses or
    baggage.This done, each officer and man will be allowed to return to
    his home, not to be disturbed by the United States authority so long
    as they observe their paroles and the laws in force where they may
    reside.U. S. GRANT, _Lieutenant-General_.HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,
    APRIL 9, 1865.GENERAL: I have received your letter of this date containing the terms
    of the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia as proposed by you.As they are substantially the same as those expressed in your letter
    of the 8th instant, they are accepted.I will proceed to designate the
    proper officers to carry the stipulation into effect.R. E. LEE, _General_.Lieutenant-General U. S. Grant.When Federal officers were seen galloping toward the Union lines from
Appomattox Court House it was quickly surmised that Lee had surrendered.Cheer after cheer was sent up by the long lines throughout their entire
length; caps and tattered colors were waved in the air.Officers and men
alike joined in the enthusiastic outburst.It was glad tidings, indeed, to
these men, who had fought and hoped and suffered through the long bloody
years.When Grant returned to his headquarters and heard salutes being fired he
ordered it stopped at once, saying, "The war is over; the rebels are our
countrymen again; and the best sign of rejoicing after the victory will be
to abstain from all demonstration in the field."Details of the surrender were arranged on the next day by staff-officers
of the respective armies.The parole officers were instructed by General
Grant to permit the Confederate soldiers to retain their own horses--a
concession that was most welcome to many of the men, who had with them
animals brought from the home farm early in the war.There were only twenty-eight thousand men to be paroled, and of these
fewer than one-third were actually bearing arms on the day of the
surrender.The Confederate losses of the last ten days of fighting
probably exceeded ten thousand.The Confederate supplies had been captured by Sheridan, and Lee's army was
almost at the point of starvation.An order from Grant caused the rations
of the Federal soldiers to be shared with the "Johnnies," and the
victorious "Yanks" were only too glad to tender such hospitality as was
within their power.These acts of kindness were slight in themselves, but
they helped immeasurably to restore good feeling and to associate for all
time with Appomattox the memory of reunion rather than of strife.The
things that were done there can never be the cause of shame to any
American.The noble and dignified bearing of the commanders was an example
to their armies and to the world that quickly had its effect in the
genuine reconciliation that followed.The scene between Lee and his devoted army was profoundly touching.General Long in his "Memoirs of Lee" says: "It is impossible to describe
the anguish of the troops when it was known that the surrender of the army
was inevitable.Of all their trials, this was the greatest and hardest to
endure."As Lee rode along the lines of the tried and faithful men who had
been with him at the Wilderness, at Spotsylvania, and at Cold Harbor, it
was not strange that those ragged, weather-beaten heroes were moved by
deep emotion and that tears streamed down their bronzed and scarred faces.Their general in broken accents admonished them to go to their homes and
be as brave citizens as they had been soldiers.Thus ended the greatest civil war in history, for soon after the fall of
the Confederate capital and the surrender of Lee's army, there followed in
quick succession the surrender of all the remaining Southern forces.While these stirring events were taking place in Virginia, Sherman, who
had swept up through the Carolinas with the same dramatic brilliancy that
marked his march to the sea, accomplishing most effective work against
Johnston, was at Goldsboro.When Johnston learned of the fall of Richmond
and Lee's surrender he knew the end had come and he soon arranged for the
surrender of his army on the terms agreed upon at Appomattox.In the first
week of May General "Dick" Taylor surrendered his command near Mobile, and
on the 10th of the same month, President Jefferson Davis, who had been for
nearly six weeks a fugitive, was overtaken and made a prisoner near
Irwinsville, Georgia.The Southern Confederacy was a thing of the past.[Illustration: MEN ABOUT TO WITNESS APPOMATTOX

No photographer was present at Appomattox, that supreme moment in our
national history, when Americans met for the last time as foes on the
field.Nothing but fanciful sketches exist of the scene inside the McLean
home.But here is a photograph that shows most of the Union officers
present at the conference.Nine of the twelve men standing above stood
also at the signing of Lee's surrender, a few days later.The scene is
City Point, in March, 1865.Grant is surrounded by a group of the officers
who had served him so faithfully.At the surrender, it was Colonel T. S.
Bowers (third from left) upon whom Grant called to make a copy of the
terms of surrender in ink.Colonel E. S. Parker, the full-blooded Indian
on Grant's staff, an excellent penman, wrote out the final copy.Nineteen
years later, General Horace Porter recorded with pride that he loaned
General Lee a pencil to make a correction in the terms.Colonels William
Duff and J. D. Webster, and General M. R. Patrick, are the three men who
were not present at the interview.All of the remaining officers were
formally presented to Lee.General Seth Williams had been Lee's adjutant
when the latter was superintendent at West Point some years before the
war.In the lower photograph General Grant stands between General Rawlins
and Colonel Bowers.The veins standing out on the back of his hand are
plainly visible.No one but he could have told how calmly the blood
coursed through them during the four tremendous years.[Illustration: GRANT BETWEEN RAWLINS AND BOWERS]

shells from distant Federal mortars; one has even burst through the wall.But it was not till the night of April 2d, when the retreat of the
Confederate forces started, that the citizens began to leave their homes.At 9 o'clock in the morning General Grant, surrounded by his staff, rode
quietly into the city.At length they arrived
at a comfortable home standing back in a yard.There he dismounted and sat
for a while on the piazza.Soon a group of curious citizens gathered on
the sidewalk to gaze at the commander of the Yankee armies.But the Union
troops did not remain long in the deserted homes.Sheridan was already in
pursuit south of the Appomattox, and Grant, after a short conference with
Lincoln, rode to the west in the rear of the hastily marching troops.Bolingbroke Street and Petersburg soon returned to the ordinary
occupations of peace in an effort to repair the ravages of the historic

The sad significance of these photographs is all too apparent.Not only
the bank buildings were in ruins, but the financial system of the entire
South.All available capital had been consumed by the demands of the war,
and a system of paper currency had destroyed credit completely.Worse
still was the demoralization of all industry.Through large areas of the
South all mills and factories were reduced to ashes, and everywhere the
industrial system was turned topsy-turvy.Truly the problem that
confronted the South was stupendous.[Illustration: WRECK OF THE GALLEGO FLOUR MILLS

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]On April 9, 1865, the very day of the surrender of Lee at Appomattox,
Lincoln, for the last time, went to the photographer's gallery.As he sits
in simple fashion sharpening his pencil, the man of sorrows cannot forget
the sense of weariness and pain that for four years has been unbroken.No
elation of triumph lights the features.One task is ended--the Nation is
saved.But another, scarcely less exacting, confronts him.The States
which lay "out of their proper practical relation to the Union," in his
own phrase, must be brought back into a proper practical relation.Only five days later the sad eyes reflected
upon this page closed forever upon scenes of earthly turmoil.Bereft of
Lincoln's heart and head, leaders attacked problems of reconstruction in
ways that proved unwise.As the mists of passion and prejudice cleared
away, both North and South came to feel that this patient, wise, and
sympathetic ruler was one of the few really great men in history, and that
he would live forever in the hearts of men made better by his presence
during those four years of storm.[Illustration: THE RETURN OF THE SOLDIERS--THE GRAND REVIEW

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.One of the proudest days of the nation--May 24, 1865--here lives again.The true greatness of the American people was not displayed till the close
of the war.The citizen from the walks of humble life had during the
contest become a veteran soldier, equal in courage and fighting capacity
to the best drilled infantry of Marlborough, Frederick the Great, or
Napoleon.But it remained to be seen whether he would return peacefully to
the occupations of peace."Would
nearly a million men," they asked, "one of the mightiest military
organizations ever trained in war, quietly lay aside this resistless power
and disappear into the unnoted walks of civil life?"The disbanded veterans
lent the effectiveness of military order and discipline to the industrial
and commercial development of the land they had come to love with an
increased devotion.The pictures are of Sherman's troops marching down
Pennsylvania Avenue.The horsemen in the lead are General Francis P. Blair
and his staff, and the infantry in flashing new uniforms are part of the
Seventeenth Corps in the Army of Tennessee.Little over a year before,
they had started with Sherman on his series of battles and flanking
marches in the struggle for Atlanta.They had taken a conspicuous and
important part in the battle of July 22d east of Atlanta, receiving and
finally repulsing attacks in both front and rear.They had marched with
Sherman to the sea and participated in the capture of Savannah.They had
joined in the campaign through the Carolinas, part of the time leading the
advance and tearing up many miles of railway track, and operating on the
extreme right after the battle of Bentonville.After the negotiations for
Johnston's surrender were completed in April, they set out on the march
for the last time with flying colors and martial music, to enter the
memorable review at Washington in May, here preserved.[Illustration: THE SAME SCENE, A FEW SECONDS LATER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.When I left here
with the men of the farm, we descended the little winding path, and
arrived at the foot of the cliff--near the little creek of Goelands,
fortunately somewhat sheltered from the waves by five or six enormous
masses of rock stretching out into the sea.Why, the two young girls I spoke of, in a swoon, with their feet
still in the water, and their bodies resting against a rock, as though
they had been placed there by some one, after being withdrawn from the
sea."said M. Rodin, raising, as usual,
the tip of his little finger to the corner of his right eye, as though to
dry a tear, which was very seldom visible."What struck me was their great resemblance to each other," resumed the
bailiff; "only one in the habit of seeing them could tell the
difference.""Twin--sisters, no doubt," said Madame Dupont."One of the poor things," continued the bailiff, "held between her
clasped hands a little bronze medal, which was suspended from her neck by
a chain of the same material."Rodin generally maintained a very stooping posture; but at these last
words of the bailiff, he drew himself up suddenly, whilst a faint color
spread itself over his livid cheeks.In any other person, these symptoms
would have appeared of little consequence; but in Rodin, accustomed for
long years to control and dissimulate his emotions, they announced no
ordinary excitement.Approaching the bailiff, he said to him in a
slightly agitated voice, but still with an air of indifference: "It was
doubtless a pious relic.Did you see what was inscribed on this medal?""No, sir; I did not think of it.""And the two young girls were like one another--very much like, you say?""So like, that one would hardly know which was which.Probably they are
orphans, for they are dressed in mourning."said M. Rodin, with another start."As they had fainted away, we carried them further on to a place where
the sand was quite dry.While we were busy about this, we saw the head of
a man appear from behind one of the rocks, which he was trying to climb,
clinging to it by one hand; we ran to him, and luckily in the nick of
time, for he was clean worn out, and fell exhausted into the arms of our
men.It was of him I spoke when I talked of a hero; for, not content with
having saved the two young girls by his admirable courage, he had
attempted to rescue a third person, and had actually gone back amongst
the rocks and breakers--but his strength failed him, and, without the aid
of our men, he would certainly have been washed away from the ridge to
which he clung."Rodin, with his head bowed upon his breast, seemed quite indifferent to
this conversation.The dismay and stupor, in which he had been plunged,
only increased upon reflection.The two girls, who had just been saved,
were fifteen years of age; were dressed in mourning; were so like, that
one might be taken for the other; one of them wore round her neck a chain
with a bronze medal; he could scarcely doubt that they were the daughters
of General Simon.But how could those sisters be amongst the number of
shipwrecked passengers?How could they have escaped from the prison at
Leipsic?How did it happen, that he had not been informed of it?Could
they have fled, or had they been set at liberty?How was it possible that
he should not be apprise of such an event?But these secondary thoughts,
which offered themselves in crowds to the mind of M. Rodin, were
swallowed up in the one fact: "the daughters of General Simon are
here!"--His plan, so laboriously laid, was thus entirely destroyed."When I speak of the deliverer of these young girls," resumed the
bailiff, addressing his wife, and without remarking M. Rodin's absence of
mind, "you are expecting no doubt to see a Hercules?--well, he is
altogether the reverse.He is almost a boy in look, with fair, sweet
face, and light, curling locks.I left him a cloak to cover him, for he
had nothing on but his shirt, black knee-breeches, and a pair of black
worsted stockings--which struck me as singular.""Why, it was certainly not a sailor's dress.""Besides, though the ship was English, I believe my hero is a Frenchman,
for he speaks our language as well as we do.What brought the tears to my
eyes, was to see the young girls, when they came to themselves.As soon
as they saw him, they threw themselves at his feet, and seemed to look up
to him and thank him, as one would pray.Then they cast their eyes around
them, as if in search of some other person, and, having exchanged a few
words, they fell sobbing into each other's arms."How many poor creatures must have
perished!""When we quitted the rocks, the sea had already cast ashore seven dead
bodies, besides fragments of the wrecks, and packages.I spoke to some of
the coast-guard, and they will remain all day on the look-out; and if, as
I hope, any more should escape with life, they are to be brought here.But surely that is the sound of voices!--yes, it is our shipwrecked
guests!"The bailiff and his wife ran to the door of the room--that door, which
opened on the long gallery--whilst Rodin, biting convulsively his flat
nails, awaited with angry impatience the arrival of the strangers.A
touching picture soon presented itself to his view.From the end of the dark some gallery, only lighted on one side by
several windows, three persons, conducted by a peasant, advanced slowly.This group consisted of the two maidens, and the intrepid young man to
whom they owed their lives.Rose and Blanche were on either side of their
deliverer, who, walking with great difficulty, supported himself lightly
on their arms.Though he was full twenty-five years of age, the juvenile countenance of
this man made him appear younger.His long, fair hair, parted on the
forehead, streamed wet and smooth over the collar of a large brown cloak,
with which he had been covered.It would be difficult to describe the
adorable expression of goodness in his pale, mild face, as pure as the
most ideal creations of Raphael's pencil--for that divine artist alone
could have caught the melancholy grace of those exquisite features, the
serenity of that celestial look, from eyes limpid and blue as those of an
archangel, or of a martyr ascended to the skies.for a blood-red halo already encircled that beauteous
head.just above his light eyebrows, and rendered
still more visible by the effect of the cold, a narrow cicatrix, from a
wound inflicted many months before, appeared to encompass his fair
forehead with a purple band; and (still more sad!)his hands had been
cruelly pierced by a crucifixion--his feet had suffered the same
injury--and, if he now walked with so much difficulty, it was that his
wounds had reopened, as he struggled over the sharp rocks.This young man was Gabriel, the priest attached to the foreign mission,
the adopted son of Dagobert's wife.He was a priest and martyr--for, in
our days, there are still martyrs, as in the time when the Caesars flung
the early Christians to the lions and tigers of the circus.Yes, in our days, the children of the people--for it is almost always
amongst them that heroic and disinterested devotion may still be
found--the children of the people, led by an honorable conviction,
because it is courageous and sincere, go to all parts of the world, to
try and propagate their faith, and brave both torture and death with the
most unpretending valor.How many of them, victims of some barbarous tribe, have perished, obscure
and unknown, in the midst of the solitudes of the two worlds!--And for
these humble soldiers of the cross, who have nothing but their faith and
their intrepidity, there is never reserved on their return (and they
seldom do return) the rich and sumptuous dignities of the church.Never
does the purple or the mitre conceal their scarred brows and mutilated
limbs; like the great majority of other soldiers, they die forgotten.[8]

In their ingenuous gratitude, the daughters of General Simon, as soon as
they recovered their senses after the shipwreck, and felt themselves able
to ascend the cliffs, would not leave to any other person the care of
sustaining the faltering steps of him who had rescued them from certain
death.The black garments of Rose and Blanche streamed with water; their faces
were deadly pale, and expressive of deep grief; the marks of recent tears
were on their cheeks, and, with sad, downcast eyes, they trembled both
from agitation and cold, as the agonizing thought recurred to them, that
they should never again see Dagobert, their friend and guide; for it was
to him that Gabriel had stretched forth a helping hand, to assist him to
climb the rocks.Unfortunately the strength of both had failed, and the
soldier had been carried away by a retreating wave.The sight of Gabriel was a fresh surprise for Rodin, who had retired on
one side, in order to observe all; but this surprise was of so pleasant a
nature, and he felt so much joy in beholding the missionary safe after
such imminent peril, that the painful impression, caused by the view of
General Simon's daughters, was a little softened.It must not be
forgotten, that the presence of Gabriel in Paris, on the 13th of
February, was essential to the success of Rodin's projects.The bailiff and his wife, who were greatly moved at sight of the orphans,
approached them with eagerness.Just then a farm-boy entered the room,
crying: "Sir!good news--two more saved from the wreck!""Blessing and praise to God for it!"asked the bailiff, hastening towards the door."There is one who can walk, and is following behind me with Justin; the
other was wounded against the rocks, and they are carrying him on a
litter made of branches.""I will run and have him placed in the room below," said the bailiff, as
he went out."Catherine, you can look to the young ladies.""And the shipwrecked man who can walk--where is he?""Here he is," said the peasant, pointing to some one who came rapidly
along the gallery; "when he heard that the two young ladies were safe in
the chateau--though he is old, and wounded in the head, he took such
great strides, that it was all I could do to get here before him."Hardly had the peasant pronounced these words, when Rose and Blanche,
springing up by a common impulse, flew to the door.They arrived there at
the same moment as Dagobert.The soldier, unable to utter a syllable, fell on his knees at the
threshold, and extended his arms to the daughters of General Simon; while
Spoil-sport, running to them licked their hands.But the emotion was too much for Dagobert; and, when he had clasped the
orphans in his arms, his head fell backward, and he would have sunk down
altogether, but for the care of the peasants.In spite of the
observations of the bailiff's wife, on their state of weakness and
agitation, the two young girls insisted on accompanying Dagobert, who was
carried fainting into an adjoining apartment.At sight of the soldier, Rodin's face was again violently contracted, for
he had till then believed that the guide of General Simon's daughters was
dead.The missionary, worn out with fatigue, was leaning upon a chair,
and had not yet perceived Rodin.A new personage, a man with a dead yellow complexion, now entered the
room, accompanied by another peasant, who pointed out Gabriel to him.This man, who had just borrowed a smock-frock and a pair of trousers,
approached the missionary, and said to him in French but with a foreign
accent: "Prince Djalma has just been brought in here.His first word was
to ask for you."cried Rodin, in a voice of thunder; for, at the
name of Djalma, he had sprung with one bound to Gabriel's side.exclaimed the missionary, falling back in surprise."M. Rodin," cried the other shipwrecked person; and from that moment, he
kept his eye fixed on the correspondent of M. Van Dael.said Gabriel, approaching Rodin with an air of
deference, not unmixed with fear.repeated Rodin, in an excited tone."Did
he not utter the name of Prince Djalma?""Yes, sir; Prince Djalma was one of the passengers on board the English
ship, which came from Alexandria, and in which we have just been wrecked.This vessel touched at the Azores, where I then was; the ship that
brought me from Charlestown having been obliged to put in there, and
being likely to remain for some time, on account of serious damage, I
embarked on board the 'Black Eagle,' where I met Prince Djalma.We were
bound to Portsmouth, and from thence my intention was to proceed to
France."This new shock had completely
paralyzed his thoughts.At length, like a man who catches at a last hope,
which he knows beforehand to be vain, he said to Gabriel: "Can you tell
me who this Prince Djalma is?""A young man as good as brave--the son of an East Indian king,
dispossessed of his territory by the English."Then, turning towards the other shipwrecked man, the missionary said to
him with anxious interest: "How is the Prince?"They are serious contusions, but they will not be mortal," answered the
other.said the missionary, addressing Rodin; "here, you
see, is another saved.""So much the better," observed Rodin, in a quick, imperious tone."I will go see him," said Gabriel, submissively."You have no orders to
give me?""Will you be able to leave this place in two or three hours,
notwithstanding your fatigue?"Gabriel only bowed in reply, and Rodin sank confounded into a chair,
while the missionary went out with the peasant.The man with the sallow
complexion still lingered in a corner of the room, unperceived by Rodin.This man was Faringhea, the half-caste, one of the three chiefs of the
Stranglers.Having escaped the pursuit of the soldiers in the ruins of
Tchandi, he had killed Mahal the Smuggler, and robbed him of the
despatches written by M. Joshua Van Dael to Rodin, as also of the letter
by which the smuggler was to have been received as passenger on board the
"Ruyter."When Faringhea left the hut in the ruins of Tchandi, he had not
been seen by Djalma; and the latter, when he met him on shipboard, after
his escape (which we shall explain by and by), not knowing that he
belonged to the sect of Phansegars, treated him during the voyage as a
fellow-countryman.Rodin, with his eye fixed and haggard, his countenance of a livid hue,
biting his nails to the quick in silent rage, did not perceive the half
caste, who quietly approached him and laying his hand familiarly on his
shoulder, said to him: "Your name is Rodin?"asked the other, starting, and raising his head abruptly."You live in the Rue du Milieu-des-Ursins, Paris?"But, once more, what do you want?""Nothing now, brother: hereafter, much!"And Faringhea, retiring, with slow steps, left Rodin alarmed at what had
passed; for this man, who scarcely trembled at anything, had quailed
before the dark look and grim visage of the Strangler.[8] We always remember with emotion the end of a letter written, two or
three years ago, by one of these young and valiant missionaries, the son
of poor parents in Beauce.He was writing to his mother from the heart of
Japan, and thus concluded his letter: "Adieu, my dear mother!they say
there is much danger where I am now sent to.Pray for me, and tell all
our good neighbors that I think of them very often."These few words,
addressed from the centre of Asia to poor peasants in a hamlet of France,
are only the more touching from their very simplicity--E. S.




CHAPTER XXVI.The most profound silence reigns throughout Cardoville House.The tempest
has lulled by degrees, and nothing is heard from afar but the hoarse
murmur of the waves, as they wash heavily the shore.Dagobert and the orphans have been lodged in warm and comfortable
apartments on the first-floor of the chateau.Djalma, too severely hurt
to be carried upstairs, has remained in a room below.At the moment of
the shipwreck, a weeping mother had placed her child in his arms.He had
failed in the attempt to snatch this unfortunate infant from certain
death, but his generous devotion had hampered his movements, and when
thrown upon the rocks, he was almost dashed to pieces.Faringhea, who has
been able to convince him of his affection, remains to watch over him.Gabriel, after administering consolation to Djalma, has rescinded to the
chamber allotted to him; faithful to the promise he made to Rodin, to be
ready to set out in two hours, he has not gone to bed; but, having dried
his clothes, he has fallen asleep in a large, high-backed arm-chair,
placed in front of a bright coal-fire.His apartment is situated near
those occupied by Dagobert and the two sisters.Spoil-sport, probably quite at his ease in so respectable a dwelling, has
quitted the door of Rose and Blanche's chamber, to lie down and warm
himself at the hearth, by the side of which the missionary is sleeping.There, with his nose resting on his outstretched paws, he enjoys a
feeling of perfect comfort and repose, after so many perils by land and
sea.We will not venture to affirm, that he thinks habitually of poor old
Jovial; unless we recognize as a token of remembrance on his part, his
irresistible propensity to bite all the white horses he has met with,
ever since the death of his venerable companion, though before, he was
the most inoffensive of dogs with regard to horses of every color.Presently one of the doors of the chamber opened, and the two sisters
entered timidly.Awake for some minutes, they had risen and dressed
themselves, feeling still some uneasiness with respect to Dagobert;
though the bailiff's wife, after showing them to their room, had returned
again to tell them that the village doctor found nothing serious in the
hurt of the old soldier, still they hoped to meet some one belonging to
the chateau, of whom they could make further inquiries about him.The high back of the old-fashioned arm-chair, in which Gabriel was
sleeping, completely screened him from view; but the orphans, seeing
their canine friend lying quietly at his feet, thought it was Dagobert
reposing there, and hastened towards him on tip-toe.To their great
astonishment, they saw Gabriel fast asleep, and stood still in confusion,
not daring to advance or recede, for fear of waking him.The long, light hair of the missionary was no longer wet, and now curled
naturally round his neck and shoulders; the paleness of his complexion
was the more striking, from the contrast afforded by the deep purple of
the damask covering of the arm-chair.His beautiful countenance expressed
a profound melancholy, either caused by the influence of some painful
dream, or else that he was in the habit of keeping down, when awake, some
sad regrets, which revealed themselves without his knowledge when he was
sleeping.Notwithstanding this appearance of bitter grief, his features
preserved their character of angelic sweetness, and seemed endowed with
an inexpressible charm, for nothing is more touching than suffering
goodness.The two young girls cast down their eyes, blushed
simultaneously, and exchanged anxious glances, as if to point out to each
other the slumbering missionary."He sleeps, sister," said Rose in a low voice."So much the better," replied Blanche, also in a whisper, making a sign
of caution; "we shall now be able to observe him well.""Yes, for we durst not do so, in coming from the sea hither.""He is just the same as we saw him in our dreams.""But here, at least, he is visible.""Not as it was in the prison at Leipsic, during that dark night.""And so--he has again rescued us.""Without him, we should have perished this morning.""And yet, sister, it seems to me, that in our dreams his countenance
shone with light.""Yes, you know it dazzled us to look at him.""And then he had not so sad a mien.""That was because he came then from heaven; now he is upon earth.""But, sister, had he then that bright red scar round his forehead?""If he has been wounded, how can he be an archangel?"If he received those wounds in preventing evil, or in
helping the unfortunate, who, like us, were about to perish?"If he did not run any danger for those he protects, it
would be less noble.""What a pity that he does not open his eye!""Their expression is so good, so tender!""Why did he not speak of our mother, by the way?""We were not alone with him; he did not like to do so.""If we were to pray to him to speak to us?"The orphans looked doubtingly at each other, with charming simplicity; a
bright glow suffused their cheeks, and their young bosoms heaved gently
beneath their black dresses.said Blanche, believing rightly, that
Rose felt exactly as she did."And yet it seems to do us good.It is as
if some happiness were going to befall us."The sisters, having approached the arm-chair on tip-toe, knelt down with
clasped hands, one to the right the other to the left of the young
priest.Turning their lovely faces towards
him, they said in a low whisper, with a soft, sweet voice, well suited to
their youthful appearance: "Gabriel!On this appeal, the missionary gave a slight start, half-opened his eyes,
and, still in a state of semi-consciousness, between sleep and waking,
beheld those two beauteous faces turned towards him, and heard two gentle
voices repeat his name.said he, rousing himself, and raising his head.It was now Gabriel's turn to blush, for he recognized the young girls he
had saved.said he to them; "you should kneel only
unto God."The orphans obeyed, and were soon beside him, holding each other by the
hand."You know my name, it seems," said the missionary with a smile."Yes--when you came from our mother."said the missionary, unable to comprehend the words of
the orphans.I saw you to-day for the first time.""Yes--do you not remember?--in our dreams.""In Germany--three months ago, for the first time.Gabriel could not help smiling at the simplicity of Rose and Blanche, who
expected him to remember a dream of theirs; growing more and more
perplexed, he repeated: "In your dreams?""Certainly; when you gave us such good advice.""And when we were so sorrowful in prison, your words, which we
remembered, consoled us, and gave us courage.""Was it not you, who delivered us from the prison at Leipsic, in that
dark night, when we were not able to see you?""What other but you would thus have come to our help, and to that of our
old friend?""We told him, that you would love him, because he loved us, although he
would not believe in angels.""And this morning, during the tempest, we had hardly any fear.""This morning--yes, my sisters--it pleased heaven to send me to your
assistance.I was coming from America, but I have never been in Leipsic.I could not, therefore, have let you out of prison.Tell me, my sisters,"
added he, with a benevolent smile, "for whom do you take me?""For a good angel whom we have seen already in dreams, sent by our mother
from heaven to protect us.""My dear sisters, I am only a poor priest.It is by mere chance, no
doubt, that I bear some resemblance to the angel you have seen in your
dreams, and whom you could not see in any other manner--for angels are
not visible to mortal eye.said the orphans, looking sorrowfully at each
other."No matter, my dear sisters," said Gabriel, taking them affectionately by
the hand; "dreams, like everything else, come from above.Since the
remembrance of your mother was mixed up with this dream, it is twice
blessed."At this moment a door opened, and Dagobert made his appearance.Up to
this time, the orphans, in their innocent ambition to be protected by an
archangel, had quite forgotten the circumstance that Dagobert's wife had
adopted a forsaken child, who was called Gabriel, and who was now a
priest and missionary.The soldier, though obstinate in maintaining that his hurt was only a
blank wound (to use a term of General Simon's), had allowed it to be
carefully dressed by the surgeon of the village, and now wore a black
bandage, which concealed one half of his forehead, and added to the
natural grimness of his features.On entering the room, he was not a
little surprised to see a stranger holding the hands of Rose and Blanche
familiarly in his own.This surprise was natural, for Dagobert did not
know that the missionary had saved the lives of the orphans, and had
attempted to save his also.In the midst of the storm, tossed about by the waves, and vainly striving
to cling to the rocks, the soldier had only seen Gabriel very
imperfectly, at the moment when, having snatched the sisters from certain
death, the young priest had fruitlessly endeavored to come to his aid.And when, after the shipwreck, Dagobert had found the orphans in safety
beneath the roof of the Manor House, he fell, as we have already stated,
into a swoon, caused by fatigue, emotion, and the effects of his
wound--so that he had again no opportunity of observing the features of
the missionary.The veteran began to frown from beneath his black bandage and thick, gray
brows, at beholding a stranger so familiar with Rose and Blanche; but the
sisters ran to throw themselves into his arms, and to cover him with
filial caresses.His anger was soon dissipated by these marks of
affection, though he continued, from time to time, to cast a suspicious
glance at the missionary, who had risen from his seat, but whose
countenance he could not well distinguish."They told us it was not
dangerous.""No, children; the surgeon of the village would bandage me up in this
manner.If my head was carbonadoes with sabre cuts, I could not have more
wrappings.They will take me for an old milksop; it is only a blank
wound, and I have a good mind to--" And therewith the soldier raised one
of his hands to the bandage."How can you be
so unreasonable--at your age?"I will do what you wish, and keep it on."Then,
drawing the sisters to one end of the room, he said to them in a low
voice, whilst he looked at the young priest from the corner of his eye:
"Who is that gentleman who was holding your hands when I came in?He has
very much the look of a curate.You see, my children, you must be on your
guard; because--"

"He?"cried both sisters at once, turning towards Gabriel."Without him,
we should not now be here to kiss you."cried the soldier, suddenly drawing up his tall figure,
and gazing full at the missionary."It is our guardian angel," resumed Blanche."Without him," said Rose, "we must have perished this morning in the
shipwreck."it is he, who--" Dagobert could say no more.With swelling heart,
and tears in his eyes, he ran to the missionary, offered him both his
hands, and exclaimed in a tone of gratitude impossible to describe: "Sir,
I owe you the lives of these two children.I feel what a debt that
service lays upon me.I will not say more--because it includes
everything!"Then, as if struck with a sudden recollection, he cried: "Stop!when I
was trying to cling to a rock, so as not to be carried away by the waves,
was it not you that held out your hand to me?Yes--that light hair--that
youthful countenance--yes--it was certainly you--now I am sure of it!""Unhappily, sir, my strength failed me, and I had the anguish to see you
fall back into the sea.""I can say nothing more in the way of thanks than what I have already
said," answered Dagobert, with touching simplicity: "in preserving these
children you have done more for me than if you had saved my own life.added the soldier, with admiration; "and so
young, with such a girlish look!""And so," cried Blanche, joyfully, "our Gabriel came to your aid also?"said Dagobert interrupting Blanche, and addressing himself to
the priest.repeated the soldier, more and more surprised.asked the soldier, with increasing
astonishment."An excellent and generous woman, whom I revere as the best of mothers:
for she had pity on me, a deserted infant, and treated me ever as her
son.""Frances Baudoin--was it not?""It was, sir," answered Gabriel, astonished in his turn."Yes, of a brave soldier--who, from the most admirable devotion, is even
now passing his life in exile--far from his wife--far from his son, my
dear brother--for I am proud to call him by that name--"

"My Agricola!--my wife!--when did you leave them?"You the father of Agricola?--Oh!I knew not, until
now," cried Gabriel, clasping his hands together, "I knew not all the
gratitude that I owed to heaven!"resumed Dagobert, in a trembling voice; "how are
they?"The accounts I received, three months ago, were excellent.""No; it is too much," cried Dagobert; "it is too much!"The veteran was
unable to proceed; his feelings stifled his words, and fell back
exhausted in a chair.And now Rose and Blanche recalled to mind that portion of their father's
letter which related to the child named Gabriel, whom the wife of
Dagobert had adopted; then they also yielded to transports of innocent
joy."Our Gabriel is the same as yours--what happiness!"he belongs to you as well as to me.Then, addressing Gabriel, the soldier added with
affectionate warmth: "Your hand, my brave boy!"Yes--that's it--thank me!--after all thou has done for us!""Does my adopted mother know of your return?"asked Gabriel, anxious to
escape from the praises of the soldier."I wrote to her five months since, but said that I should come alone;
there was a reason for it, which I will explain by and by.Does she still
live in the Rue Brise-Miche?"In that case, she must have received my letter.I wished to write to her
from the prison at Leipsic, but it was impossible.""Yes; I come straight from Germany, by the Elbe and Hamburg, and I should
be still at Leipsic, but for an event which the Devil must have had a
hand in--a good sort of devil, though.""That would be difficult, for I cannot explain it to myself.These little
ladies," he added, pointing with a smile to Rose and Blanche, "pretended
to know more about it than I did, and were continually repeating: 'It was
the angel that came to our assistance, Dagobert--the good angel we told
thee of--though you said you would rather have Spoil sport to defend
us--'"

"Gabriel, I am waiting for you," said a stern voice, which made the
missionary start.They all turned round instantly, whilst the dog uttered
a deep growl.He stood in the doorway leading to the corridor.His
features were calm and impassive, but he darted a rapid, piercing glance
at the soldier and sisters.said Dagobert, very little prepossessed in favor of
Rodin, whose countenance he found singularly repulsive."What the
mischief does he want?""I must go with him," answered Gabriel, in a tone of sorrowful
constraint.Then, turning to Rodin, he added: "A thousand pardons!cried Dagobert, stupefied with amazement, "going the very instant
we have just met?I have too much to
tell you, and to ask in return.It
will be a real treat for me."He is my superior, and I must obey him.""Your superior?--why, he's in citizen's dress.""He is not obliged to wear the ecclesiastical garb."since he is not in uniform, and there is no provost-marshal in
your troop, send him to the--"

"Believe me, I would not hesitate a minute, if it were possible to
remain.""I was right in disliking the phi of that man," muttered Dagobert between
his teeth.Then he added, with an air of impatience and vexation: "Shall
I tell him that he will much oblige us by marching off by himself?""I beg you not to do so," said Gabriel; "it would be useless; I know my
duty, and have no will but my superior's.As soon as you arrive in Paris,
I will come and see you, as also my adopted mother, and my dear brother,
Agricola."I have been a soldier, and know what subordination
is," said Dagobert, much annoyed."One must put a good face on bad
fortune.So, the day after to-morrow, in the Rue Brise-Miche, my boy; for
they tell me I can be in Paris by to-morrow evening, and we set out
almost immediately.But I say--there seems to be a strict discipline with
you fellows!""Yes, it is strict and severe," answered Gabriel, with a shudder, and a
stifled sigh."Come, shake hands--and let's say farewell for the present.After all,
twenty-four hours will soon pass away."replied the missionary, much moved, whilst he returned
the friendly pressure of the veteran's hand.added the orphans, sighing also, and with tears in
their eyes.said Gabriel--and he left the room with Rodin, who
had not lost a word or an incident of this scene.Two hours after, Dagobert and the orphans had quitted the Castle for
Paris, not knowing that Djalma was left at Cardoville, being still too
much injured to proceed on his journey.The half-caste, Faringhea,
remained with the young prince, not wishing, he said, to desert a fellow
countryman.We now conduct the reader to the Rue Brise-Miche, the residence of
Dagobert's wife.The following scenes occur in Paris, on the morrow of the day when the
shipwrecked travellers were received in Cardoville House.Nothing can be more gloomy than the aspect of the Rue Brise-Miche, one
end of which leads into the Rue Saint-Merry, and the other into the
little square of the Cloister, near the church.At this end, the street,
or rather alley--for it is not more than eight feet wide--is shut in
between immense black, muddy dilapidated walls, the excessive height of
which excludes both air and light; hardly, during the longest days of the
year, is the sun able to throw into it a few straggling beams; whilst,
during the cold damps of winter, a chilling fog, which seems to penetrate
everything, hangs constantly above the miry pavement of this species of
oblong well.It was about eight o'clock in the evening; by the faint, reddish light of
the street lamp, hardly visible through the haze, two men, stopping at
the angle of one of those enormous walls, exchanged a few words together."So," said one, "you understand all about it.You are to watch in the
street, till you see them enter No."And when you see 'em enter so as to make quite sure of the game, go up
to Frances Baudoin's room--"

"Under the cloak of asking where the little humpbacked workwoman
lives--the sister of that gay girl, the Queen of the Bacchanals.""Yes--and you must try and find out her address also--from her humpbacked
sister, if possible--for it is very important.Women of her feather
change their nests like birds, and we have lost track of her.""Make yourself easy; I will do my best with Hump, to learn where her
sister hangs out.""And, to give you steam, I'll wait for you at the tavern opposite the
Cloister, and we'll have a go of hot wine on your return.""I'll not refuse, for the night is deucedly cold."This morning the water friz on my sprinkling-brush,
and I turned as stiff as a mummy in my chair at the church-door.a distributor of holy water is not always upon roses!""Luckily, you have the pickings--"

"Well, well--good luck to you!Don't forget the Fiver, the little passage
next to the dyer's shop."One proceeded to the Cloister Square; the other towards the further end
of the street, where it led into the Rue Saint-Merry.This latter soon
found the number of the house he sought--a tall, narrow building, having,
like all the other houses in the street, a poor and wretched appearance.When he saw he was right, the man commenced walking backwards and
forwards in front of the door of No.If the exterior of these buildings was uninviting, the gloom and squalor
of the interior cannot be described.5 was, in a special
degree, dirty and dilapidated.The water, which oozed from the wall,
trickled down the dark and filthy staircase.On the second floor, a wisp
of straw had been laid on the narrow landing-place, for wiping the feet
on; but this straw, being now quite rotten, only served to augment the
sickening odor, which arose from want of air, from damp, and from the
putrid exhalations of the drains.The few openings, cut at rare intervals
in the walls of the staircase, could hardly admit more than some faint
rays of glimmering light.In this quarter, one of the most populous in Paris, such houses as these,
poor, cheerless, and unhealthy, are generally inhabited by the working
classes.A dyer occupied the
ground floor; the deleterious vapors arising from his vats added to the
stench of the whole building.On the upper stories, several artisans
lodged with their families, or carried on their different trades.Up four
flights of stairs was the lodging of Frances Baudoin, wife of Dagobert.It consisted of one room, with a closet adjoining, and was now lighted by
a single candle.Agricola occupied a garret in the roof.Old grayish paper, broken here and there by the cracks covered the crazy
wall, against which rested the bed; scanty curtains, running upon an iron
rod, concealed the windows; the brick floor, not polished, but often
washed, had preserved its natural color.At one end of this room was a
round iron stove, with a large pot for culinary purposes.On the wooden
table, painted yellow, marbled with brown, stood a miniature house made
of iron--a masterpiece of patience and skill, the work of Agricola
Baudoin, Dagobert's son.A plaster crucifix hung up against the wall, surrounded by several
branches of consecrated box-tree, and various images of saints, very
coarsely, bore witness to the habits of the soldier's wife.Between the windows stood one of those old walnut-wood presses, curiously
fashioned, and almost black with time; an old arm-chair, covered with
green cotton velvet (Agricola's first present to his mother), a few rush
bottomed chairs, and a worktable on which lay several bags of coarse,
brown cloth, completed the furniture of this room, badly secured by a
worm-eaten door.The adjoining closet contained a few kitchen and
household utensils.Mean and poor as this interior may perhaps appear, it would not seem so
to the greater number of artisans; for the bed was supplied with two
mattresses, clean sheets, and a warm counterpane; the old-fashioned press
contained linen; and, moreover, Dagobert's wife occupied all to herself a
room as large as those in which numerous families, belonging to honest
and laborious workmen, often live and sleep huddled together--only too
happy if the boys and girls can have separate beds, or if the sheets and
blankets are not pledged at the pawnbroker's.Frances Baudoin, seated beside the small stove, which, in the cold and
damp weather, yielded but little warmth, was busied in preparing her son
Agricola's evening meal.Dagobert's wife was about fifty years of age; she wore a close jacket of
blue cotton, with white flowers on it, and a stuff petticoat; a white
handkerchief was tied round her head, and fastened under the chin.Her
countenance was pale and meagre, the features regular, and expressive of
resignation and great kindness.It would have been difficult to find a
better, a more courageous mother.With no resource but her labor, she had
succeeded, by unwearied energy, in bringing up not only her own son
Agricola, but also Gabriel, the poor deserted child, of whom, with
admirable devotion, she had ventured to take charge.In her youth, she had, as it were, anticipated the strength of later
life, by twelve years of incessant toil, rendered lucrative by the most
violent exertions, and accompanied by such privations as made it almost
suicidal.Then (for it was a time of splendid wages, compared to the
present), by sleepless nights and constant labor, she contrived to earn
about two shillings (fifty sous) a day, and with this she managed to
educate her son and her adopted child.At the end of these twelve years, her health was ruined, and her strength
nearly exhausted; but, at all events, her boys had wanted for nothing,
and had received such an education as children of the people can obtain.About this time, M. Francois Hardy took Agricola as an apprentice, and
Gabriel prepared to enter the priest's seminary, under the active
patronage of M. Rodin, whose communications with the confessor of Frances
Baudoin had become very frequent about the year 1820.This woman (whose piety had always been excessive) was one of those
simple natures, endowed with extreme goodness, whose self-denial
approaches to heroism, and who devote themselves in obscurity to a life
of martyrdom--pure and heavenly minds, in whom the instincts of the heart
supply the place of the intellect!The only defect, or rather the necessary consequence of this extreme
simplicity of character, was the invincible determination she displayed
in yielding to the commands of her confessor, to whose influence she had
now for many years been accustomed to submit.She regarded this influence
as most venerable and sacred; no mortal power, no human consideration,
could have prevented her from obeying it.Did any dispute arise on the
subject, nothing could move her on this point; she opposed to every
argument a resistance entirely free from passion--mild as her
disposition, calm as her conscience--but, like the latter, not to be
shaken.In a word, Frances Baudoin was one of those pure, but
uninstructed and credulous beings, who may sometimes, in skillful and
dangerous hands, become, without knowing it, the instruments of much
evil.For some time past, the bad state of her health, and particularly the
increasing weakness of her sight, had condemned her to a forced repose;
unable to work more than two or three hours a day, she consumed the rest
of her time at church.Frances rose from her seat, pushed the coarse bags at which she had been
working to the further end of the table, and proceeded to lay the cloth
for her son's supper, with maternal care and solicitude.She took from
the press a small leathern bag, containing an old silver cup, very much
battered, and a fork and spoon, so worn and thin, that the latter cut
like a knife.These, her only plate (the wedding present of Dagobert) she
rubbed and polished as well as she was able, and laid by the side of her
son's plate.They were the most precious of her possessions, not so much
for what little intrinsic value might attach to them, as for the
associations they recalled; and she had often shed bitter tears, when,
under the pressure of illness or want of employment, she had been
compelled to carry these sacred treasures to the pawnbroker's.Frances next took, from the lower shelf of the press, a bottle of water,
and one of wine about three-quarters full, which she also placed near her
son's plate; she then returned to the stove, to watch the cooking of the
supper.Though Agricola was not much later than usual, the countenance of his
mother expressed both uneasiness and grief; one might have seen, by the
redness of her eyes, that she had been weeping a good deal.After long
and painful uncertainty, the poor woman had just arrived at the
conviction that her eyesight, which had been growing weaker and weaker,
would soon be so much impaired as to prevent her working even the two or
three hours a day which had lately been the extent of her labors.Originally an excellent hand at her needle, she had been obliged, as her
eyesight gradually failed her, to abandon the finer for the coarser sorts
of work, and her earnings had necessarily diminished in proportion; she
had at length been reduced to the necessity of making those coarse bags
for the army, which took about four yards of sewing, and were paid at the
rate of two sous each, she having to find her own thread.This work,
being very hard, she could at most complete three such bags in a day, and
her gains thus amounted to threepence (six sous)!It makes one shudder to think of the great number of unhappy females,
whose strength has been so much exhausted by privations, old age, or
sickness, that all the labor of which they are capable, hardly suffices
to bring them in daily this miserable pittance.Thus do their gains
diminish in exact proportion to the increasing wants which age and
infirmity must occasion.Happily, Frances had an efficient support in her son.A first-rate
workman, profiting by the just scale of wages adopted by M. Hardy, his
labor brought him from four to five shillings a day--more than double
what was gained by the workmen of many other establishments.Admitting
therefore that his mother were to gain nothing, he could easily maintain
both her and himself.But the poor woman, so wonderfully economical that she denied herself
even some of the necessaries of life, had of late become ruinously
liberal on the score of the sacristy, since she had adopted the habit of
visiting daily the parish church.Scarcely a day passed but she had
masses sung, or tapers burnt, either for Dagobert, from whom she had been
so long separated, or for the salvation of her son Agricola, whom she
considered on the high-road to perdition.Agricola had so excellent a
heart, so loved and revered his mother, and considered her actions in
this respect inspired by so touching a sentiment, that he never
complained when he saw a great part of his week's wages (which he paid
regularly over to his mother every Saturday) disappear in pious forms.Yet now and then he ventured to remark to Frances, with as much respect
as tenderness, that it pained him to see her enduring privations
injurious at her age, because she preferred incurring these devotional
expenses.But what answer could he make to this excellent mother, when
she replied with tears: "My child, 'tis for the salvation of your father
and yours too."To dispute the efficacy of masses, would have been venturing on a
subject which Agricola, through respect for his mother's religious faith,
never discussed.He contented himself, therefore, with seeing her
dispense with comforts she might have enjoyed.THE SISTER OF THE BACCHANAL QUEEN.The person who now entered was a girl of about eighteen, short, and very
much deformed.Though not exactly a hunchback, her spine was curved; her
breast was sunken, and her head deeply set in the shoulders.Her face was
regular, but long, thin, very pale, and pitted with the small pox; yet it
expressed great sweetness and melancholy.Her blue eyes beamed with
kindness and intelligence.By a strange freak of nature, the handsomest
woman would have been proud of the magnificent hair twisted in a coarse
net at the back of her head.Though
miserably clad, the care and neatness of her dress revealed a powerful
struggle with her poverty.Notwithstanding the cold, she wore a scanty
frock made of print of an indefinable color, spotted with white; but it
had been so often washed, that its primitive design and color had long
since disappeared.In her resigned, yet suffering face, might be read a
long familiarity with every form of suffering, every description of
taunting.From her birth, ridicule had ever pursued her.We have said
that she was very deformed, and she was vulgarly called "Mother Bunch."Indeed it was so usual to give her this grotesque name, which every
moment reminded her of her infirmity, that Frances and Agricola, though
they felt as much compassion as other people showed contempt for her,
never called her, however, by any other name.Mother Bunch, as we shall therefore call her in future, was born in the
house in which Dagobert's wife had resided for more than twenty years;
and she had, as it were, been brought up with Agricola and Gabriel.There are wretches fatally doomed to misery.Mother Bunch had a very
pretty sister, on whom Perrine Soliveau, their common mother, the widow
of a ruined tradesman, had concentrated all her affection, while she
treated her deformed child with contempt and unkindness.The latter would
often come, weeping, to Frances, on this account, who tried to console
her, and in the long evenings amused her by teaching her to read and sew.Accustomed to pity her by their mother's example, instead of imitating
other children, who always taunted and sometimes even beat her, Agricola
and Gabriel liked her, and used to protect and defend her.She was about fifteen, and her sister Cephyse was about seventeen, when
their mother died, leaving them both in utter poverty.Cephyse was
intelligent, active, clever, but different to her sister; she had the
lively, alert, hoydenish character which requires air, exercise and
pleasures--a good girl enough, but foolishly spoiled by her mother.Cephyse, listening at first to Frances's good advice, resigned herself to
her lot; and, having learnt to sew, worked like her sister, for about a
year.But, unable to endure any longer the bitter privations her
insignificant earnings, notwithstanding her incessant toil, exposed her
to--privations which often bordered on starvation--Cephyse, young,
pretty, of warm temperament, and surrounded by brilliant offers and
seductions--brilliant, indeed, for her, since they offered food to
satisfy her hunger, shelter from the cold, and decent raiment, without
being obliged to work fifteen hours a day in an obscure and unwholesome
hovel--Cephyse listened to the vows of a young lawyer's clerk, who
forsook her soon after.She formed a connection with another clerk, whom
she (instructed by the examples set her), forsook in turn for a bagman,
whom she afterwards cast off for other favorites.In a word, what with
changing and being forsaken, Cephyse, in the course of one or two years,
was the idol of a set of grisettes, students and clerks; and acquired
such a reputation at the balls on the Hampstead Heaths of Paris, by her
decision of character, original turn of mind, and unwearied ardor in all
kinds of pleasures, and especially her wild, noisy gayety, that she was
termed the Bacchanal Queen, and proved herself in every way worthy of
this bewildering royalty.From that time poor Mother Bunch only heard of her sister at rare
intervals.She still mourned for her, and continued to toil hard to gain
her three-and-six a week.The unfortunate girl, having been taught sewing
by Frances, made coarse shirts for the common people and the army.For
these she received half-a-crown a dozen.They had to be hemmed, stitched,
provided with collars and wristbands, buttons, and button holes; and at
the most, when at work twelve and fifteen hours a day, she rarely
succeeded in turning out more than fourteen or sixteen shirts a week--an
excessive amount of toil that brought her in about three shillings and
fourpence a week.And the case of this poor girl was neither accidental
nor uncommon.And this, because the remuneration given for women's work
is an example of revolting injustice and savage barbarism.They are paid
not half as much as men who are employed at the needle: such as tailors,
and makers of gloves, or waistcoats, etc.--no doubt because women can
work as well as men--because they are more weak and delicate--and because
their need may be twofold as great when they become mothers.Well, Mother Bunch fagged on, with three-and-four a week.That is to say,
toiling hard for twelve or fifteen hours every day; she succeeded in
keeping herself alive, in spite of exposure to hunger, cold, and
poverty--so numerous were her privations.The word
privation expresses but weakly that constant and terrible want of all
that is necessary to preserve the existence God gives; namely, wholesome
air and shelter, sufficient and nourishing food and warm clothing.Mortification would be a better word to describe that total want of all
that is essentially vital, which a justly organized state of society
ought--yes--ought necessarily to bestow on every active, honest workman
and workwoman, since civilization has dispossessed them of all
territorial right, and left them no other patrimony than their hands.The savage does not enjoy the advantage of civilization; but he has, at
least, the beasts of the field, the fowls of the air, the fish of the
sea, and the fruits of the earth, to feed him, and his native woods for
shelter and for fuel.The civilized man, disinherited of these gifts,
considering the rights of property as sacred, may, in return for his hard
daily labor, which enriches his country, demand wages that will enable
him to live in the enjoyment of health: nothing more, and nothing less.For is it living, to drag along on the extreme edge which separates life
from the grave, and even there continually struggle against cold, hunger,
and disease?And to show how far the mortification which society imposes
thus inexorably on its millions of honest, industrious laborers (by its
careless disregard of all the questions which concern the just
remuneration of labor), may extend, we will describe how this poor girl
contrived to live on three shillings and sixpence a week.Society, perhaps, may then feel its obligation to so many unfortunate
wretches for supporting, with resignation, the horrible existence which
leaves them just sufficient life to feel the worst pangs of humanity.Yes: to live at such a price is virtue!Yes, society thus organized,
whether it tolerates or imposes so much misery, loses all right to blame
the poor wretches who sell themselves not through debauchery, but because
they are cold and famishing.This poor girl spent her wages as follows:

    Six pounds of bread, second quality..0 8 1/2
    Four pails of water..0 2
    Lard or dripping (butter being out of the question)0 5
    Coarse salt..0 0 3/4
    A bushel of charcoal..0 4
    A quart of dried vegetables..0 3
    Three quarts of potatoes..0 2
    Dips..0 3 1/4

                                                       2 7

To save charcoal, Mother Bunch prepared soup only two or three times a
week at most, on a stove that stood on the landing of the fourth story.There remained nine or ten pence a week
for clothes and lodging.By rare good fortune, her situation was in one
respect an exception to the lot of many others.Agricola, that he might
not wound her delicacy, had come to a secret arrangement with the
housekeeper, and hired a garret for her, just large enough to hold a
small bed, a chair, and a table; for which the sempstress had to pay five
shillings a year.But Agricola, in fulfilment of his agreement with the
porter, paid the balance, to make up the actual rent of the garret, which
was twelve and sixpence.The poor girl had thus about eighteenpence a
month left for her other expenses.But many workwomen, whose position is
less fortunate than hers, since they have neither home nor family, buy a
piece of bread and some other food to keep them through the day; and at
night patronize the "twopenny rope," one with another, in a wretched room
containing five or six beds, some of which are always engaged by men, as
male lodgers are by far the most abundant.Yes; and in spite of the
disgust that a poor and virtuous girl must feel at this arrangement, she
must submit to it; for a lodging-house keeper cannot have separate rooms
for females.To furnish a room, however meanly, the poor workwoman must
possess three or four shillings in ready money.But how save this sum,
out of weekly earnings of a couple of florins, which are scarcely
sufficient to keep her from starving, and are still less sufficient to
clothe her?The poor wretch must resign herself to this repugnant
cohabitation; and so, gradually, the instinct of modesty becomes
weakened; the natural sentiment of chastity, that saved her from the "gay
life," becomes extinct; vice appears to be the only means of improving
her intolerable condition; she yields; and the first "man made of money,"
who can afford a governess for his children, cries out against the
depravity of the lower orders!And yet, painful as the condition of the
working woman is, it is relatively fortunate.Should work fail her for
one day, two days, what then?Should sickness come--sickness almost
always occasioned by unwholesome food, want of fresh air, necessary
attention, and good rest; sickness, often so enervating as to render work
impossible; though not so dangerous as to procure the sufferer a bed in
an hospital--what becomes of the hapless wretches then?The mind
hesitates, and shrinks from dwelling on such gloomy pictures.This inadequacy of wages, one terrible source only of so many evils, and
often of so many vices, is general, especially among women; and, again
this is not private wretchedness, but the wretchedness which afflicts
whole classes, the type of which we endeavor to develop in Mother Bunch.It exhibits the moral and physical condition of thousands of human
creatures in Paris, obliged to subsist on a scanty four shillings a week.This poor workwoman, then, notwithstanding the advantages she unknowingly
enjoyed through Agricola's generosity, lived very miserably; and her
health, already shattered, was now wholly undermined by these constant
hardships.Yet, with extreme delicacy, though ignorant of the little
sacrifice already made for her by Agricola, Mother Bunch pretended she
earned more than she really did, in order to avoid offers of service
which it would have pained her to accept, because she knew the limited
means of Frances and her son, and because it would have wounded her
natural delicacy, rendered still more sensitive by so many sorrows and
humiliations.But, singular as it may appear, this deformed body contained a loving and
generous soul--a mind cultivated even to poetry; and let us add, that
this was owing to the example of Agricola Baudoin, with whom she had been
brought up, and who had naturally the gift.This poor girl was the first
confidant to whom our young mechanic imparted his literary essays; and
when he told her of the charm and extreme relief he found in poetic
reverie, after a day of hard toil, the workwoman, gifted with strong
natural intelligence, felt, in her turn, how great a resource this would
be to her in her lonely and despised condition.One day, to Agricola's great surprise, who had just read some verses to
her, the sewing-girl, with smiles and blushes, timidly communicated to
him also a poetic composition.Her verses wanted rhythm and harmony,
perhaps; but they were simple and affecting, as a non-envenomed complaint
entrusted to a friendly hearer.From that day Agricola and she held
frequent consultations; they gave each other mutual encouragement: but
with this exception, no one else knew anything of the girl's poetical
essays, whose mild timidity made her often pass for a person of weak
intellect.This soul must have been great and beautiful, for in all her
unlettered strains there was not a word of murmuring respecting her hard
lot: her note was sad, but gentle--desponding, but resigned; it was
especially the language of deep tenderness--of mournful sympathy--of
angelic charity for all poor creatures consigned, like her, to bear the
double burden of poverty and deformity.Yet she often expressed a sincere
free-spoken admiration of beauty, free from all envy or bitterness; she
admired beauty as she admired the sun.many were the verses of
hers that Agricola had never seen, and which he was never to see.The young mechanic, though not strictly handsome, had an open masculine
face; was as courageous as kind; possessed a noble, glowing, generous
heart, a superior mind, and a frank, pleasing gayety of spirits.The
young girl, brought up with him, loved him as an unfortunate creature can
love, who, dreading cruel ridicule, is obliged to hide her affection in
the depths of her heart, and adopt reserve and deep dissimulation.She
did not seek to combat her love; to what purpose should she do so?Her well known sisterly affection for Agricola
explained the interest she took in all that concerned him; so that no one
was surprised at the extreme grief of the young workwoman, when, in 1830,
Agricola, after fighting intrepidly for the people's flag, was brought
bleeding home to his mother.Dagobert's son, deceived, like others, on
this point, had never suspected, and was destined never to suspect, this
love for him.Such was the poorly-clad girl who entered the room in which Frances was
preparing her son's supper."Is it you, my poor love," said she; "I have not seen you since morning:
have you been ill?The young girl kissed Agricola's mother, and replied: "I was very busy
about some work, mother; I did not wish to lose a moment; I have only
just finished it.I am going down to fetch some charcoal--do you want
anything while I'm out?""No, no, my child, thank you.It is half-past
eight, and Agricola is not come home."Then she added, after a sigh: "He
kills himself with work for me.Ah, I am very unhappy, my girl; my sight
is quite going.In a quarter of an hour after I begin working, I cannot
see at all--not even to sew sacks.The idea of being a burden to my son
drives me distracted.""Oh, don't, ma'am, if Agricola heard you say that--"

"I know the poor boy thinks of nothing but me, and that augments my
vexation.Only I think that rather than leave me, he gives up the
advantages that his fellow-workmen enjoy at Hardy's, his good and worthy
master--instead of living in this dull garret, where it is scarcely light
at noon, he would enjoy, like the other workmen, at very little expense,
a good light room, warm in winter, airy in summer, with a view of the
garden.not to mention that this place is so
far from his work, that it is quite a toil to him to get to it.""Oh, when he embraces you he forgets his fatigue, Mrs.Baudoin," said
Mother Bunch; "besides, he knows how you cling to the house in which he
was born.M. Hardy offered to settle you at Plessy with Agricola, in the
building put up for the workmen.""Yes, my child; but then I must give up church."But--be easy, I hear him," said the hunchback, blushing.A sonorous, joyous voice was heard singing on the stairs."At least, I'll not let him see that I have been crying," said the good
mother, drying her tears."This is the only moment of rest and ease from
toil he has--I must not make it sad to him."Our blacksmith poet, a tall young man, about four-and-twenty years of
age, was alert and robust, with ruddy complexion, dark hair and eyes, and
aquiline nose, and an open, expressive countenance.His resemblance to
Dagobert was rendered more striking by the thick brown moustache which he
wore according to the fashion; and a sharp-pointed imperial covered his
chin.His cheeks, however, were shaven, Olive color velveteen trousers, a
blue blouse, bronzed by the forge smoke, a black cravat, tied carelessly
round his muscular neck, a cloth cap with a narrow vizor, composed his
dress.The only thing which contrasted singularly with his working
habiliments was a handsome purple flower, with silvery pistils, which he
held in his hand."Good-evening, mother," said he, as he came to kiss Frances immediately.Then, with a friendly nod, he added, "Good-evening, Mother Bunch.""You are very late, my child," said Frances, approaching the little stove
on which her son's simple meal was simmering; "I was getting very
anxious.""Anxious about me, or about my supper, dear mother?"you won't excuse me for keeping the nice little supper
waiting that you get ready for me, for fear it should be spoilt, eh?"So saying, the blacksmith tried to kiss his mother again."Have done, you naughty boy; you'll make me upset the pan.""That would be a pity, mother; for it smells delightfully."I'll swear, now, you have some of the fried potatoes and bacon I'm so
fond of."said Frances, in a tone of mild reproach."True," rejoined Agricola, exchanging a smile of innocent cunning with
Mother Bunch; "but, talking of Saturday, mother, here are my wages.""Thank ye, child; put the money in the cupboard."cried the young sempstress, just as Agricola was about to put
away the money, "what a handsome flower you have in your hand, Agricola."See there, mother," said Agricola, taking the flower to her; "look at
it, admire it, and especially smell it.You can't have a sweeter perfume;
a blending of vanilla and orange blossom.""Indeed, it does smell nice, child.said
Frances, admiringly; "where did you find it?"repeated Agricola, smilingly: "do you think
folks pick up such things between the Barriere du Maine and the Rue
Brise-Miche?"inquired the sewing girl, sharing in Frances's
curiosity.Well, I'll satisfy you, and explain why I
came home so late; for something else detained me.It has been an evening
of adventures, I promise you.I was hurrying home, when I heard a low,
gentle barking at the corner of the Rue de Babylone; it was just about
dusk, and I could see a very pretty little dog, scarce bigger than my
fist, black and tan, with long, silky hair, and ears that covered its
paws.""Lost, poor thing, I warrant," said Frances.I took up the poor thing, and it began to lick my hands.Round its neck was a red satin ribbon, tied in a large bow; but as that
did not bear the master's name, I looked beneath it, and saw a small
collar, made of a gold plate and small gold chains.So I took a Lucifer
match from my 'bacco-box, and striking a light, I read, 'FRISKY belongs
to Hon.Miss Adrienne de Cardoville, No."Why, you were just in the street," said Mother Bunch.Taking the little animal under my arm, I looked about me till I
came to a long garden wall, which seemed to have no end, and found a
small door of a summer-house, belonging no doubt to the large mansion at
the other end of the park; for this garden looked just like a park.So,
looking up I saw 'No.7,' newly painted over a little door with a grated
slide.I rang; and in a few minutes, spent, no doubt, in observing me
through the bars (for I am sure I saw a pair of eyes peeping through),
the gate opened.And now, you'll not believe a word I have to say."said Mother Bunch, as if she was really her namesake of
elfish history.I am quite astounded, even now, at my
adventure; it is like the remembrance of a dream.""Well, let us have it," said the worthy mother, so deeply interested that
she did not perceive her son's supper was beginning to burn."First," said the blacksmith, smiling at the curiosity he had excited, "a
young lady opened the door to me, but so lovely, so beautifully and
gracefully dressed, that you would have taken her for a beautiful
portrait of past times.Before I could say a word, she exclaimed, 'Ah!dear me, sir, you have brought back Frisky; how happy Miss Adrienne will
be!Come, pray come in instantly; she would so regret not having an
opportunity to thank you in person!'And without giving me time to reply,
she beckoned me to follow her.Oh, dear mother, it is quite out of my
power to tell you, the magnificence I saw, as I passed through a small
saloon, partially lighted, and full of perfume!A door opened,--Oh, such a sight!I
was so dazzled I can remember nothing but a great glare of gold and
light, crystal and flowers; and, amidst all this brilliancy, a young lady
of extreme beauty--ideal beauty; but she had red hair, or rather hair
shining like gold!She had black eyes, ruddy lips, and her skin seemed white as
snow.This is all I can recollect: for, as I said before, I was so
dazzled, I seemed to be looking through a veil.'Madame,' said the young
woman, whom I never should have taken for a lady's-maid, she was dressed
so elegantly, 'here is Frisky.This gentleman found him, and brought him
back.''Oh, sir,' said the young lady with the golden hair, in a sweet
silvery voice, 'what thanks I owe you!I am foolishly attached to
Frisky.'Then, no doubt, concluding from my dress that she ought to thank
me in some other way than by words, she took up a silk purse, and said to
me, though I must confess with some hesitation--'No doubt, sir, it gave
you some trouble to bring my pet back.You have, perhaps, lost some
valuable time--allow me--' She held forth her purse.""Oh, Agricola," said Mother Bunch, sadly; "how people may be deceived!""Hear the end, and you will perhaps forgive the young lady.Seeing by my
looks that the offer of the purse hurt me, she took a magnificent
porcelain vase that contained this flower, and, addressing me in a tone
full of grace and kindness, that left me room to guess that she was vexed
at having wounded me, she said--'At least, sir, you will accept this
flower.'""You are right, Agricola," said the girl, smiling sadly; "an involuntary
error could not be repaired in a nicer way."Worthy young lady," said Frances, wiping her eyes; "how well she
understood my Agricola!"But just as I was taking the flower, without daring
to raise my eyes (for, notwithstanding the young lady's kind manner,
there was something very imposing about her) another handsome girl, tall
and dark, and dressed to the top of fashion, came in and said to the
red-haired young lady, 'He is here, Madame.'She immediately rose and
said to me, 'A thousand pardons, sir.I shall never forget that I am
indebted to you for a moment of much pleasure.Pray remember, on all
occasions, my address and name--Adrienne de Cardoville.'I could not find a word to say in reply.The same young
woman showed me to the door, and curtseyed to me very politely.And there
I stood in the Rue de Babylone, as dazzled and astonished as if I had
come out of an enchanted palace.""Indeed, my child, it is like a fairy tale."Yes, ma'am," said Mother Bunch, in an absent manner that Agricola did
not observe."What affected me most," rejoined Agricola, "was, that the young lady, on
seeing her little dog, did not forget me for it, as many would have done
in her place, and took no notice of it before me.That shows delicacy and
feeling, does it not?Indeed, I believe this young lady to be so kind and
generous, that I should not hesitate to have recourse to her in any
important case.""Yes, you are right," replied the sempstress, more and more absent.She felt no jealousy, no hatred,
towards this young stranger, who, from her beauty, wealth, and delicacy,
seemed to belong to a sphere too splendid and elevated to be even within
the reach of a work, girl's vision; but, making an involuntary comparison
of this fortunate condition with her own, the poor thing had never felt
more cruelly her deformity and poverty.Yet such were the humility and
gentle resignation of this noble creature, that the only thing which made
her feel ill-disposed towards Adrienne de Cardoville was the offer of the
purse to Agricola; but then the charming way in which the young lady had
atoned for her error, affected the sempstress deeply.She could not restrain her tears as she contemplated the
magnificent flower--so rich in color and perfume, which, given by a
charming hand, was doubtless very precious to Agricola."Now, mother," resumed the young man smilingly, and unaware of the
painful emotion of the other bystander, "you have had the cream of my
adventures first.I have told you one of the causes of my delay; and now
for the other.Just now, as I was coming in, I met the dyer at the foot
of the stairs, his arms a beautiful pea-green.Stopping me he said, with
an air full of importance, that he thought he had seen a chap sneaking
about the house like a spy, 'Well, what is that to you, Daddy Loriot?'said I: 'are you afraid he will nose out the way to make the beautiful
green, with which you are dyed up to the very elbows?'""But who could that man be, Agricola?""On my word, mother, I don't know and scarcely care; I tried to persuade
Daddy Loriot, who chatters like a magpie, to return to his cellar, since
it could signify as little to him as to me, whether a spy watched him or
not."So saying, Agricola went and placed the little leathern sack,
containing his wages, on a shelf, in the cupboard.As Frances put down the saucepan on the end of the table, Mother Bunch,
recovering from her reverie, filled a basin with water, and, taking it to
the blacksmith, said to him in a gentle tone-"Agricola--for your hands."Then with a most unaffected
gesture and tone, he added, "There is my fine flower for your trouble."cried the sempstress, with emotion, while a vivid
blush  her pale and interesting face."Do you give me this
handsome flower, which a lovely rich young lady so kindly and graciously
gave you?"And the poor thing repeated, with growing astonishment, "Do
you give it to me?""What the deuce should I do with it?Wear it on my heart, have it set as
a pin?""It is true I was very much impressed by
the charming way in which the young lady thanked me.I am delighted to
think I found her little dog, and very happy to be able to give you this
flower, since it pleases you.You see the day has been a happy one."While Mother Bunch, trembling with pleasure, emotion, and surprise, took
the flower, the young blacksmith washed his hands, so black with smoke
and steel filings that the water became dark in an instant.Agricola,
pointing out this change to the sempstress, said to her in a whisper,
laughing,-"Here's cheap ink for us paper-stainers!I finished some verses
yesterday, which I am rather satisfied with.With this, Agricola wiped his hands naturally on the front of his blouse,
while Mother Bunch replaced the basin on the chest of drawers, and laid
the flower against the side of it."Can't you ask for a towel," said Frances, shrugging her shoulders,
"instead of wiping your hands on your blouse?""After being scorched all day long at the forge, it will be all the
better for a little cooling to-night, won't it?Scold me, then, if you dare!Frances made no reply; but, placing her hands on either side of her son's
head, so beautiful in its candor, resolution and intelligence, she
surveyed him for a moment with maternal pride, and kissed him repeatedly
on the forehead."Come," said she, "sit down: you stand all day at your forge, and it is
late.""So,--your arm-chair again!"said Agricola.--"Our usual quarrel every
evening--take it away, I shall be quite as much at ease on another."You ought at least to rest after your hard toil.""Well, I preach like a
good apostle; but I am quite at ease in your arm-chair, after all.Since
I sat down on the throne in the Tuileries, I have never had a better
seat."Frances Baudoin, standing on one side of the table, cut a slice of bread
for her son, while Mother Bunch, on the other, filled his silver mug.There was something affecting in the attentive eagerness of the two
excellent creatures, for him whom they loved so tenderly."Thank you, Agricola," replied the sempstress, looking down, "I have only
just dined.""Oh, I only ask you for form's sake--you have your whims--we can never
prevail on you to eat with us--just like mother; she prefers dining all
alone; and in that way she deprives herself without my knowing it."It is better for my health to dine early.Oh, I am very fond of
stockfish; I should have been born a Newfoundland fisherman."This worthy lad, on the contrary, was but poorly refreshed, after a hard
day's toil, with this paltry stew,--a little burnt as it had been, too,
during his story; but he knew he pleased his mother by observing the fast
without complaining.He affected to enjoy his meal; and the good woman
accordingly observed with satisfaction:

"Oh, I see you like it, my dear boy; Friday and Saturday next we'll have
some more.""Thank you, mother,--only not two days together.One gets tired of
luxuries, you know!And now, let us talk of what we shall do
to-morrow--Sunday.We must be very merry, for the last few days you seem
very sad, dear mother, and I can't make it out--I fancy you are not
satisfied with me.""Oh, my dear child!--you--the pattern of--"

"Well, well!Prove to me that you are happy, then, by taking a little
amusement.Perhaps you will do us the honor of accompanying us, as you
did last time," added Agricola, bowing to Mother Bunch.The latter blushed and looked down; her face assumed an expression of
bitter grief, and she made no reply."I have the prayers to attend all day, you know, my dear child," said
Frances to her son.I don't propose the theatre; but they say
there is a conjurer to be seen whose tricks are very amusing."I am obliged to you, my son; but that is a kind of theatre.""My dear child, do I ever hinder others from doing what they like?"Well, then, if it should be fine, we will
simply take a walk with Mother Bunch on the Boulevards.It is nearly
three months since she went out with us; and she never goes out without
us.""No, no; go alone, my child."You know very well, Agricola," said the sempstress, blushing up to the
eyes, "that I ought not to go out with you and your mother again."May I ask, without impropriety, the cause of this
refusal?"The poor girl smiled sadly, and replied, "Because I will not expose you
to a quarrel on my account, Agricola.""Forgive me," said Agricola, in a tone of sincere grief, and he struck
his forehead vexedly.To this Mother Bunch alluded sometimes, but very rarely, for she observed
punctilious discretion.The girl had gone out with Agricola and his
mother.Such occasions were, indeed, holidays for her.Many days and
nights had she toiled hard to procure a decent bonnet and shawl, that she
might not do discredit to her friends.The five or six days of holidays,
thus spent arm in arm with him whom she adored in secret, formed the sum
of her happy days.Taking their last walk, a coarse, vulgar man elbowed her so rudely that
the poor girl could not refrain from a cry of terror, and the man
retorted it by saying,-"What are you rolling your hump in my way for,
stoopid?"Agricola, like his father, had the patience which force and courage give
to the truly brave; but he was extremely quick when it became necessary
to avenge an insult.Irritated at the vulgarity of this man, Agricola
left his mother's arm to inflict on the brute, who was of his own age,
size, and force, two vigorous blows, such as the powerful arm and huge
fist of a blacksmith never before inflicted on human face.The villain
attempted to return it, and Agricola repeated the correction, to the
amusement of the crowd, and the fellow slunk away amidst a deluge of
hisses.This adventure made Mother Bunch say she would not go out with
Agricola again, in order to save him any occasion of quarrel.We may
conceive the blacksmith's regret at having thus unwittingly revived the
memory of this circumstance,--more painful, alas!for Mother Bunch than
Agricola could imagine, for she loved him passionately, and her infirmity
had been the cause of that quarrel.Notwithstanding his strength and
resolution, Agricola was childishly sensitive; and, thinking how painful
that thought must be to the poor girl, a large tear filled his eyes, and,
holding out his hands, he said, in a brotherly tone, "Forgive my
heedlessness!And he gave her thin, pale cheeks two
hearty kisses.The poor girl's lips turned pale at this cordial caress; and her heart
beat so violently that she was obliged to lean against the corner of the
table."Come, you forgive me, do you not?"she said, trying to subdue her emotion; "but the recollection
of that quarrel pains me--I was so alarmed on your account; if the crowd
had sided with that man!"said Frances, coming to the sewing-girl's relief, without knowing
it, "I was never so afraid in all my life!""Oh, mother," rejoined Agricola, trying to change a conversation which
had now become disagreeable for the sempstress, "for the wife of a horse
grenadier of the Imperial Guard, you have not much courage.Oh, my brave
father; I can't believe he is really coming!The very thought turns me
topsy-turvy!""Heaven grant he may come," said Frances, with a sigh.Lord knows, you
have had masses enough said for his return.""Agricola, my child," said Frances, interrupting her son, and shaking her
head sadly, "do not speak in that way.Besides, you are talking of your
father.""Well, I'm in for it this evening.'Tis your turn now; positively, I am
growing stupid, or going crazy.That's the
only word I can get out to-night.You know that, when I do let out on
certain subjects, it is because I can't help it; for I know well the pain
it gives you.""You do not offend me, my poor, dear, misguided boy.""It comes to the same thing; and there is nothing so bad as to offend
one's mother; and, with respect to what I said about father's return, I
do not see that we have any cause to doubt it.""But we have not heard from him for four months.""You know, mother, in his letter--that is, in the letter which he
dictated (for you remember that, with the candor of an old soldier, he
told us that, if he could read tolerably well, he could not write); well,
in that letter he said we were not to be anxious about him; that he
expected to be in Paris about the end of January, and would send us word,
three or four days before, by what road he expected to arrive, that I
might go and meet him.""True, my child; and February is come, and no news yet.""The greater reason why we should wait patiently.But I'll tell you more:
I should not be surprised if our good Gabriel were to come back about the
same time.His last letter from America makes me hope so.What pleasure,
mother, should all the family be together!""And that day will soon come, trust me.""Do you remember your father, Agricola?""To tell the truth, I remember most his great grenadier's shako and
moustache, which used to frighten me so, that nothing but the red ribbon
of his cross of honor, on the white facings of his uniform, and the
shining handle of his sabre, could pacify me; could it, mother?What he must suffer at being separated from us at
his age--sixty and past!my child, my heart breaks, when I think
that he comes home only to change one kind of poverty for another."Isn't there a room here for you and for him;
and a table for you too?Only, my good mother, since we are talking of
domestic affairs," added the blacksmith, imparting increased tenderness
to his tone, that he might not shock his mother, "when he and Gabriel
come home, you won't want to have any more masses said, and tapers burned
for them, will you?Well, that saving will enable father to have tobacco
to smoke, and his bottle of wine every day.Then, on Sundays, we will
take a nice dinner at the eating-house."Instead of doing so, some one half-opened the door,
and, thrusting in an arm of a pea-green color, made signs to the
blacksmith."'Tis old Loriot, the pattern of dyers," said Agricola; "come in, Daddy,
no ceremony.""Impossible, my lad; I am dripping with dye from head to foot; I should
cover missus's floor with green."It will remind me of the fields I like so much.""Without joking, Agricola, I must speak to you immediately."Oh, be easy; what's he to us?""No; I think he's gone; at any rate, the fog is so thick I can't see him.But that's not it--come, come quickly!It is very important," said the
dyer, with a mysterious look; "and only concerns you.""Go and see, my child," said Frances."Yes, mother; but the deuce take me if I can make it out."And the blacksmith left the room, leaving his mother with Mother Bunch.In five minutes Agricola returned; his face was pale and agitated--his
eyes glistened with tears, and his hands trembled; but his countenance
expressed extraordinary happiness and emotion.He stood at the door for a
moment, as if too much affected to accost his mother.Frances's sight was so bad that she did not immediately perceive the
change her son's countenance had undergone."Well, my child--what is it?"Before the blacksmith could reply, Mother Bunch, who had more
discernment, exclaimed: "Goodness, Agricola--how pale you are!"Mother," said the artisan, hastening to Frances, without replying to the
sempstress,--"mother, expect news that will astonish you; but promise me
you will be calm."Mother Bunch was
right--you are quite pale."and Agricola, kneeling before Frances, took both her
hands in his--"you must--you do not know,--but--"

The blacksmith could not go on.'What is the matter?--you
terrify me!""Oh, no, I would not terrify you; on the contrary," said Agricola, drying
his eyes--"you will be so happy.But, again, you must try and command
your feelings, for too much joy is as hurtful as too much grief.""Did I not say true, when I said he would come?"She rose from her seat; but her surprise and
emotion were so great that she put one hand to her heart to still its
beating, and then she felt her strength fail.Her son sustained her, and
assisted her to sit down.Mother Bunch, till now, had stood discreetly apart, witnessing from a
distance the scene which completely engrossed Agricola and his mother.But she now drew near timidly, thinking she might be useful; for Frances
changed color more and more."Come, courage, mother," said the blacksmith; "now the shock is over, you
have only to enjoy the pleasure of seeing my father."Oh, I cannot believe it,"
said Frances, bursting into tears."So true, that if you will promise me to keep as calm as you can, I will
tell you when you may see him.""He may arrive any minute--to-morrow--perhaps to-day."Well, I must tell you all--he has arrived.""He--he is--" Frances could not articulate the word.Before coming up, he sent the dyer to
apprise me that I might prepare you; for my brave father feared the
surprise might hurt you.""And now," cried the blacksmith, in an accent of indescribable joy--"he
is there, waiting!for the last ten minutes I have scarcely
been able to contain myself--my heart is bursting with joy."And running
to the door, he threw it open.Dagobert, holding Rose and Blanche by the hand, stood on the threshold.Instead of rushing to her husband's arms, Frances fell on her knees in
prayer.She thanked heaven with profound gratitude for hearing her
prayers, and thus accepting her offerings.During a second, the actors of
this scene stood silent and motionless.Agricola, by a sentiment of
respect and delicacy, which struggled violently with his affection, did
not dare to fall on his father's neck.He waited with constrained
impatience till his mother had finished her prayer.The soldier experienced the same feeling as the blacksmith; they
understood each other.The first glance exchanged by father and son
expressed their affection--their veneration for that excellent woman, who
in the fulness of her religious fervor, forgot, perhaps, too much the
creature for the Creator.Rose and Blanche, confused and affected, looked with interest on the
kneeling woman; while Mother Bunch, shedding in silence tears of joy at
the thought of Agricola's happiness, withdrew into the most obscure
corner of the room, feeling that she was a stranger, and necessarily out
of place in that family meeting.Frances rose, and took a step towards
her husband, who received her in his arms.There was a moment of solemn
silence.Dagobert and Frances said not a word.Nothing could be heard but
a few sighs, mingled with sighs of joy.And, when the aged couple looked
up, their expression was calm, radiant, serene; for the full and complete
enjoyment of simple and pure sentiments never leaves behind a feverish
and violent agitation."My children," said the soldier, in tones of emotion, presenting the
orphans to Frances, who, after her first agitation, had surveyed them
with astonishment, "this is my good and worthy wife; she will be to the
daughters of General Simon what I have been to them.""Then, madame, you will treat us as your children," said Rose,
approaching Frances with her sister.cried Dagobert's wife, more and more
astonished."Yes, my dear Frances; I have brought them from afar not without some
difficulty; but I will tell you that by and by."One would take them for two angels, exactly alike!"said Frances, contemplating the orphans with as much interest as
admiration."Now--for us," cried Dagobert, turning to his son.We must renounce all attempts to describe the wild joy of Dagobert and
his son, and the crushing grip of their hands, which Dagobert interrupted
only to look in Agricola's face; while he rested his hands on the young
blacksmith's broad shoulders that he might see to more advantage his
frank masculine countenance, and robust frame.Then he shook his hand
again, exclaiming, "He's a fine fellow--well built--what a good-hearted
look he has!"From a corner of the room Mother Bunch enjoyed Agricola's happiness; but
she feared that her presence, till then unheeded, would be an intrusion.She wished to withdraw unnoticed, but could not do so.Dagobert and his
son were between her and the door; and she stood unable to take her eyes
from the charming faces of Rose and Blanche.She had never seen anything
so winsome; and the extraordinary resemblance of the sisters increased
her surprise.Then, their humble mourning revealing that they were poor,
Mother Bunch involuntarily felt more sympathy towards them.They are cold; their little hands are frozen, and,
unfortunately, the fire is out," said Frances, She tried to warm the
orphans' hands in hers, while Dagobert and his son gave themselves up to
the feelings of affection, so long restrained.As soon as Frances said that the fire was out, Mother Bunch hastened to
make herself useful, as an excuse for her presence; and, going to the
cupboard, where the charcoal and wood were kept, she took some small
pieces, and, kneeling before the stove, succeeded, by the aid of a few
embers that remained, in relighting the fire, which soon began to draw
and blaze.Filling a coffee-pot with water, she placed it on the stove,
presuming that the orphans required some warm drink.The sempstress did
all this with so much dexterity and so little noise--she was naturally so
forgotten amidst the emotions of the scene--that Frances, entirely
occupied with Rose and Blanche, only perceived the fire when she felt its
warmth diffusing round, and heard the boiling water singing in the
coffee-pot.This phenomenon--fire rekindling of itself--did not astonish
Dagobert's wife then, so wholly was she taken up in devising how she
could lodge the maidens; for Dagobert as we have seen, had not given her
notice of their arrival.Suddenly a loud bark was heard three or four times at the door.there's Spoil-sport," said Dagobert, letting in his dog; "he
wants to come in to brush acquaintance with the family too."The dog came in with a bound, and in a second was quite at home.After
having rubbed Dagobert's hand with his muzzle, he went in turns to greet
Rose and Blanche, and also Frances and Agricola; but seeing that they
took but little notice of him, he perceived Mother Bunch, who stood
apart, in an obscure corner of the room, and carrying out the popular
saying, "the friends of our friends are our friends," he went and licked
the hands of the young workwoman, who was just then forgotten by all.By
a singular impulse, this action affected the girl to tears; she patted
her long, thin, white hand several times on the head of the intelligent
dog.Then, finding that she could be no longer useful (for she had done
all the little services she deemed in her power), she took the handsome
flower Agricola had given her, opened the door gently, and went away so
discreetly that no one noticed her departure.After this exchange of
mutual affection, Dagobert, his wife, and son, began to think of the
realities of life."Poor Frances," said the soldier, glancing at Rose and Blanche, "you did
not expect such a pretty surprise!""I am only sorry, my friend," replied Frances, "that the daughters of
General Simon will not have a better lodging than this poor room; for
with Agricola's garret--"

"It composes our mansion," interrupted Dagobert; "there are handsomer, it
must be confessed.But be at ease; these young ladies are drilled into
not being hard to suit on that score.To-morrow, I and my boy will go arm
and arm, and I'll answer for it he won't walk the more upright and
straight of the two, and find out General Simon's father, at M. Hardy's
factory, to talk about business.""To-morrow," said Agricola to Dagobert, "you will not find at the factory
either M. Hardy or Marshall Simon's father.""What is that you say, my lad?"cried Dagobert, hastily, "the Marshal!""To be sure; since 1830, General Simon's friends have secured him the
title and rank which the emperor gave him at the battle of Ligny."cried Dagobert, with emotion, "but that ought not to surprise
me; for, after all, it is just; and when the emperor said a thing, the
least they can do is to let it abide.But it goes all the same to my
heart; it makes me jump again."Addressing the sisters, he said: "Do you hear that, my children?You
arrive in Paris the daughters of a Duke and Marshal of France.One would
hardly think it, indeed, to see you in this room, my poor little
duchesses!Ah, father Simon must have
been very glad to hear that his son was restored to his rank!"He told us he would renounce all kinds of ranks and titles to see his
son again; for it was during the general's absence that his friends
obtained this act of justice.But they expect Marshal Simon every moment,
for the last letter from India announced his departure."At these words Rose and Blanche looked at each other; and their eyes
filled with tears.These children rely on his return; but why shall we
not find M. Hardy and father Simon at the factory to-morrow?""Ten days ago, they went to examine and study an English mill established
in the south; but we expect them back every day."that's vexing; I relied on seeing the general's father, to
talk over some important matters with him.At any rate, they know where
to write to him.So to-morrow you will let him know, my lad, that his
granddaughters are arrived.In the mean time, children," added the
soldier, to Rose and Blanche, "my good wife will give you her bed and you
must put up with the chances of war.they will not be worse
off here than they were on the journey.""You know we shall always be well off with you and madame," said Rose."Besides, we only think of the pleasure of being at length in Paris,
since here we are to find our father," added Blanche."That hope gives you patience, I know," said Dagobert, "but no matter!After all you have heard about it, you ought to be finely surprised, my
children.As yet, you have not found it the golden city of your dreams,
by any means.But, patience, patience; you'll find Paris not so bad as it
looks.""Besides," said Agricola, "I am sure the arrival of Marshal Simon in
Paris will change it for you into a golden city.""You are right, Agricola," said Rose, with a smile, "you have, indeed,
guessed us.""Certainly, Agricola, we often talked about you with Dagobert; and
latterly, too, with Gabriel," added Blanche.cried Agricola and his mother, at the same time."Yes," replied Dagobert, making a sign of intelligence to the orphans,
"we have lots to tell you for a fortnight to come; and among other
things, how we chanced to meet with Gabriel.All I can now say is that,
in his way, he is quite as good as my boy (I shall never be tired of
saying'my boy'); and they ought to love each other like brothers.Oh, my
brave, brave wife!"said Dagobert, with emotion, "you did a good thing,
poor as you were, taking the unfortunate child--and bringing him up with
your own.""Don't talk so much about it, my dear; it was such a simple thing.""You are right; but I'll make you amends for it by and by.'Tis down to
your account; in the mean time, you will be sure to see him to-morrow
morning."cried the blacksmith; "who'll say, after
this, that there are not days set apart for happiness?How came you to
meet him, father?""I'll tell you all, by and by, about when and how we met Gabriel; for if
you expect to sleep, you are mistaken.You'll give me half your room, and
a fine chat we'll have.Spoil-sport will stay outside of this door; he is
accustomed to sleep at the children's door.""Dear me, love, I think of nothing.But, at such a moment, if you and the
young ladies wish to sup, Agricola will fetch something from the
cook-shop.""No, thank you, Dagobert, we are not hungry; we are too happy.""You will take a little wine and water, sweetened, nice and hot, to warm
you a little, my dear young ladies," said Frances; "unfortunately, I have
nothing else to offer you.""You are right, Frances; the dear children are tired, and want to go to
bed; while they do so, I'll go to my boy's room, and, before Rose and
Blanche are awake, I will come down and converse with you, just to give
Agricola a respite.""It is good Mother Bunch come to see if we want her," said Agricola."But I think she was here when my husband came in," added Frances."Right, mother; and the good girl left lest she should be an intruder:
she is so thoughtful.But no--no--it is not she who knocks so loud.""Go and see who it is, then, Agricola."Before the blacksmith could reach the door, a man decently dressed, with
a respectable air, entered the room, and glanced rapidly round, looking
for a moment at Rose and Blanche."Allow me to observe, sir," said Agricola, "that after knocking, you
might have waited till the door was opened, before you entered."Pray excuse me, sir," said the man, very politely, and speaking slowly,
perhaps to prolong his stay in the room: "I beg a thousand pardons--I
regret my intrusion--I am ashamed--"

"Well, you ought to be, sir," said Agricola, with impatience, "what do
you want?""Pray, sir, does not Miss Soliveau, a deformed needlewoman, live here?""No, sir; upstairs," said Agricola."Really, sir," cried the polite man, with low bows, "I am quite abroad at
my blunder: I thought this was the room of that young person.I brought
her proposals for work from a very respectable party.""It is very late, sir," said Agricola, with surprise."But that young
person is as one of our family.Call to-morrow; you cannot see her to
night; she is gone to bed.""Then, sir, I again beg you to excuse--"

"Enough, sir," said Agricola, taking a step towards the door."I hope, madame and the young ladies, as well as this gent, will be
assured that--"

"If you go on much longer making excuses, sir, you will have to excuse
the length of your excuses; and it is time this came to an end!"Rose and Blanche smiled at these words of Agricola; while Dagobert rubbed
his moustache with pride."But that does not
astonish you--you are used to it."During this speech, the ceremonious person withdrew, having again
directed a long inquiring glance to the sisters, and to Agricola and
Dagobert.In a few minutes after, Frances having spread a mattress on the ground
for herself, and put the whitest sheets on her bed for the orphans,
assisted them to undress with maternal solicitude, Dagobert and Agricola
having previously withdrawn to their garret.Just as the blacksmith, who
preceded his father with a light, passed before the door of Mother
Bunch's room, the latter, half concealed in the shade, said to him
rapidly, in a low tone:

"Agricola, great danger threatens you: I must speak to you."These words were uttered in so hasty and low a voice that Dagobert did
not hear them; but as Agricola stopped suddenly, with a start, the old
soldier said to him,

"Well, boy, what is it?""Nothing, father," said the blacksmith, turning round; "I feared I did
not light you well.""Oh, stand at ease about that; I have the legs and eyes of fifteen to
night;" and the soldier, not noticing his son's surprise, went into the
little room where they were both to pass the night.On leaving the house, after his inquiries about Mother Bunch, the over
polite Paul Pry slunk along to the end of Brise-Miche Street.He advanced
towards a hackney-coach drawn up on the Cloitre Saint-Merry Square.In this carriage lounged Rodin, wrapped in a cloak."The two girls and the man with gray moustache went directly to Frances
Baudoin's; by listening at the door, I learnt that the sisters will sleep
with her, in that room, to-night; the old man with gray moustache will
share the young blacksmith's room.""I did not dare insist on seeing the deformed workwoman this evening on
the subject of the Bacchanal Queen; I intend returning to-morrow, to
learn the effect of the letter she must have received this evening by the
post about the young blacksmith."And now you will call, for me, on Frances Baudoin's
confessor, late as it is; you will tell him that I am waiting for him at
Rue du Milieu des Ursins--he must not lose a moment.Should I not be returned, he will wait for me.You will tell him it
is on a matter of great moment.""All shall be faithfully executed," said the ceremonious man, cringing to
Rodin, as the coach drove quickly away.AGRICOLA AND MOTHER BUNCH.Within one hour after the different scenes which have just been described
the most profound silence reigned in the soldier's humble dwelling.A
flickering light, which played through two panes of glass in a door,
betrayed that Mother Bunch had not yet gone to sleep; for her gloomy
recess, without air or light, was impenetrable to the rays of day, except
by this door, opening upon a narrow and obscure passage, connected with
the roof.A sorry bed, a table, an old portmanteau, and a chair, so
nearly filled this chilling abode, that two persons could not possibly be
seated within it, unless one of them sat upon the side of the bed.The magnificent and precious flower that Agricola had given to the girl
was carefully stood up in a vessel of water, placed upon the table on a
linen cloth, diffusing its sweet odor around, and expanding its purple
calix in the very closet, whose plastered walls, gray and damp, were
feebly lighted by the rays of an attenuated candle.The sempstress, who
had taken off no part of her dress, was seated upon her bed--her looks
were downcast, and her eyes full of tears.She supported herself with one
hand resting on the bolster; and, inclining towards the door, listened
with painful eagerness, every instant hoping to hear the footsteps of
Agricola.The heart of the young sempstress beat violently; her face,
usually very pale, was now partially flushed--so exciting was the emotion
by which she was agitated.Sometimes she cast her eyes with terror upon a
letter which she held in her hand, a letter that had been delivered by
post in the course of the evening, and which had been placed by the
housekeeper (the dyer) upon the table, while she was rendering some
trivial domestic services during the recognitions of Dagobert and his
family.After some seconds, Mother Bunch heard a door, very near her own, softly
opened."I waited till my father went to sleep," said the blacksmith, in a low
voice, his physiognomy evincing much more curiosity than uneasiness."But
what is the matter, my good sister?said she, her voice trembling with emotion, while she
hastily presented to him the open letter.Agricola held it towards the
light, and read what follows:

"A person who has reasons for concealing himself, but who knows the
sisterly interest you take in the welfare of Agricola Baudoin, warns you.That young and worthy workman will probably be arrested in the course of
to-morrow."exclaimed Agricola, looking at Mother Bunch with an air of stupefied
amazement.quickly replied the sempstress, clasping her hands.Agricola resumed reading, scarcely believing the evidence of his
eyes:-"The song, entitled 'Working-men Freed,' has been declared
libellous.Numerous copies of it have been found among the papers of a
secret society, the leaders of which are about to be incarcerated, as
being concerned in the Rue des Prouvaires conspiracy."said the girl, melting into tears, "now I see it all.The man who
was lurking about below, this evening, who was observed by the dyer, was,
doubtless, a spy, lying in wait for you coming home."My verses
breathe nothing but philanthropy.Am I to blame, if they have been found
among the papers of a secret society?"Agricola disdainfully threw the
letter upon the table."If you wish it," said Agricola, "I will; no time is lost."He resumed the reading of the letter:

"A warrant is about to be issued against Agricola Baudoin.There is mo
doubt of his innocence being sooner or later made clear; but it will be
well if he screen himself for a time as much as possible from pursuit, in
order that he may escape a confinement of two or three months previous to
trial--an imprisonment which would be a terrible blow for his mother,
whose sole support he is."A SINCERE FRIEND, who is compelled to remain unknown."After a moment's silence, the blacksmith raised his head; his countenance
resumed its serenity; and laughing, he said: "Reassure yourself, good
Mother Bunch, these jokers have made a mistake by trying their games on
me.It is plainly an attempt at making an April-fool of me before the
time.""Agricola, for the love of heaven!"said the girl, in a supplicating
tone; "treat not the warning thus lightly.Believe in my forebodings, and
listen to my advice.""I tell you again, my good girl," replied Agricola, "that it is two
months since my song was published.It is not in any way political;
indeed, if it were, they would not have waited till now before coming
down on me.""But," said the other, "you forget that new events have arisen.It is
scarcely two days since the conspiracy was discovered, in this very
neighborhood, in the Rue des Prouvaires.And," continued she, "if the
verses, though perhaps hitherto unnoticed, have now been found in the
possession of the persons apprehended for this conspiracy, nothing more
is necessary to compromise you in the plot."in which I only praise the
love of labor and of goodness!If so, justice
would be but a blind noodle.That she might grope her way, it would be
necessary to furnish her with a dog and a pilgrim's staff to guide her
steps.""Agricola," resumed Mother Bunch; overwhelmed with anxiety and terror on
hearing the blacksmith jest at such a moment, "I conjure you to listen to
me!No doubt you uphold in the verses the sacred love of labor; but you
do also grievously deplore and deprecate the unjust lot of the poor
laborers, devoted as they are, without hope, to all the miseries of life;
you recommend, indeed, only fraternity among men; but your good and noble
heart vents its indignation, at the same time, against the selfish and
the wicked.In fine, you fervently hasten on, with the ardor of your
wishes, the emancipation of all the artisans who, less fortunate than
you, have not generous M. Hardy for employer.Say, Agricola, in these
times of trouble, is there anything more necessary to compromise you than
that numerous copies of your song have been found in possession of the
persons who have been apprehended?"Agricola was moved by these affectionate and judicious expressions of an
excellent creature, who reasoned from her heart; and he began to view
with more seriousness the advice which she had given him.Perceiving that she had shaken him, the sewing-girl went on to say: "And
then, bear your fellow-workman, Remi, in recollection.""Yes," resumed the sempstress; "a letter of his, a letter in itself quite
insignificant, was found in the house of a person arrested last year for
conspiracy; and Remi, in consequence, remained a month in prison.""That is true, but the injustice of his implication was easily shown, and
he was set at liberty.""Yes, Agricola: but not till he had lain a month in prison; and that has
furnished the motive of the person who advised you to conceal yourself!These words made a powerful impression upon Agricola.He took up the
letter and again read it attentively."And the man who has been lurking all this evening about the house?""I constantly recall that circumstance, which cannot be
naturally accounted for.what a blow it would be for your father,
and poor mother, who is incapable of earning anything.consider, then, what would become of them
without you--without your labor!""It would indeed be terrible," said Agricola, impatiently casting the
letter upon the table."What you have said concerning Remi is too true.He was as innocent as I am: yet an error of justice, an involuntary error
though it be, is not the less cruel.But they don't commit a man without
hearing him.""But they arrest him first, and hear him afterwards," said Mother Bunch,
bitterly; "and then, after a month or two, they restore him his liberty.And if he have a wife and children, whose only means of living is his
daily labor, what becomes of them while their only supporter is in
prison?They suffer hunger, they endure cold, and they weep!"At these simple and pathetic words, Agricola trembled."A month without work," he said, with a sad and thoughtful air."And my
mother, and father, and the two young ladies who make part of our family
until the arrival in Paris of their father, Marshal Simon.That thought, in spite of myself, affrights me!"exclaimed the girl impetuously; "suppose you apply to M.
Hardy; he is so good, and his character is so much esteemed and honored,
that, if he offered bail for you, perhaps they would give up their
persecution?""Unfortunately," replied Agricola, "M. Hardy is absent; he is on a
journey with Marshal Simon."After a silence of some time, Agricola, striving to surmount his fear,
added: "But no!After all, I had
rather await what may come.I'll at least have the chance of proving my
innocence on my first examination: for indeed, my good sister, whether it
be that I am in prison or that I fly to conceal myself, my working for my
family will be equally prevented."that is true," said the poor girl; "what is to be done!"My brave father," said Agricola to himself, "if this misfortune happen
to-morrow, what an awakening it will be for him, who came here to sleep
so joyously!"The blacksmith buried his face in his hands.Unhappily Mother Bunch's fears were too well-founded, for it will be
recollected that at that epoch of the year 1832, before and after the Rue
des Prouvaires conspiracy, a very great number of arrests had been made
among the working classes, in consequence of a violent reaction against
democratical ideas.Suddenly, the girl broke the silence which had been maintained for some
seconds.A blush  her features, which bore the impressions of an
indefinable expression of constraint, grief, and hope."The young lady, so beautiful, so good, who gave you this flower" (she
showed it to the blacksmith) "who has known how to make reparation with
so much delicacy for having made a painful offer, cannot but have a
generous heart.You must apply to her--"

With these words which seemed to be wrung from her by a violent effort
over herself, great tears rolled down her cheeks.For the first time in
her life she experienced a feeling of grievous jealousy.Another woman
was so happy as to have the power of coming to the relief of him whom she
idolized; while she herself, poor creature, was powerless and wretched."But what could be done
with this young lady?""Did she not say to you," answered Mother Bunch, "'Remember my name; and
in all circumstances address yourself to me?'""This young lady, in her exalted position, ought to have powerful
connections who will be able to protect and defend you.Go to her to
morrow morning; tell her frankly what has happened, and request her
support.""But tell me, my good sister, what it is you wish me to do?"I remember that, in former times, my father told us that he had
saved one of his friends from being put in prison, by becoming surety for
him.It will be easy for you so to convince this young lady of your
innocence, that she will be induced to become surety; and after that, you
will have nothing more to fear."said Agricola, "to ask so great a service from a person
to whom one is almost unknown is hard.""Believe me, Agricola," said the other sadly, "I would never counsel what
could possibly lower you in the eyes of any one, and above all--do you
understand?--above all, in the eyes of this young lady.I do not propose
that you should ask money from her; but only that she should give surety
for you, in order that you may have the liberty of continuing at your
employment, so that the family may not be without resources.Believe me,
Agricola, that such a request is in no respect inconsistent with what is
noble and becoming upon your part.The heart of the young lady is
generous.The required surety will be
as nothing to her; while to you it will be everything, and will even be
the very life to those who depend upon you.""You are right, my good sister," said Agricola, with sadness and
dejection."It is perhaps worth while to risk taking this step.If the
young lady consent to render me this service, and if giving surety will
indeed preserve me from prison, I shall be prepared for every event.added he, rising, "I'd never dare to make the request to her!What is the insignificant service that I
rendered her, when compared with that which I should solicit from her?""Do you imagine then, Agricola, that a generous spirit measures the
services which ought to be rendered, by those previously received?Trust
to me respecting a matter which is an affair of the heart.I am, it is
true, but a lowly creature, and ought not to compare myself with any
other person.I am nothing, and I can do nothing.Nevertheless, I am
sure--yes, Agricola, I am sure--that this young lady, who is so very far
above me, will experience the same feelings that I do in this affair;
yes, like me, she will at once comprehend that your position is a cruel
one; and she will do with joy, with happiness, with thankfulness, that
which I would do, if, alas!I could do anything more than uselessly
consume myself with regrets."In spite of herself, she pronounced the last words with an expression so
heart-breaking--there was something so moving in the comparison which
this unfortunate creature, obscure and disdained, infirm and miserable,
made of herself with Adrienne de Cardoville, the very type of resplendent
youth, beauty, and opulence--that Agricola was moved even to tears; and,
holding out one of his hands to the speaker, he said to her, tenderly,
"How very good you are; how full of nobleness, good feeling, and
delicacy!""Unhappily," said the weeping girl, "I can do nothing more than advise.""And your counsels shall be followed out, my sister dear.They are those
of a soul the most elevated I have ever known.Yes, you have won me over
into making this experiment, by persuading me that the heart of Miss de
Cardoville is perhaps equal in value to your own!"At this charming and sincere assimilation of herself to Miss Adrienne,
the sempstress forgot almost everything she had suffered, so exquisitely
sweet and consoling were her emotions.If some poor creatures, fatally
devoted to sufferings, experience griefs of which the world knows naught,
they sometimes, too, are cheered by humble and timid joys, of which the
world is equally ignorant.The least word of true tenderness and
affection, which elevates them in their own estimation, is ineffably
blissful for these unfortunate beings, habitually consigned, not only to
hardships and to disdain, but even to desolating doubts, and distrust of
themselves."Then it is agreed that you will go, to-morrow morning to this young
lady's house?"exclaimed Mother Bunch, trembling with a new-born hope."And," she quickly added, "at break of day I'll go down to watch at the
street-door, to see if there be anything suspicious, and to apprise you
of what I perceive.""It will be necessary to endeavor to set off before the wakening of your
father," said the hunchback."The quarter in which the young lady dwells,
is so deserted, that the mere going there will almost serve for your
present concealment.""I think I hear the voice of my father," said Agricola suddenly.In truth, the little apartment was so near Agricola's garret, that he and
the sempstress, listening, heard Dagobert say in the dark:

"Agricola, is it thus that you sleep, my boy?Why, my first sleep is
over; and my tongue itches deucedly."said Mother Bunch; "your absence would disquiet
him.On no account go out to-morrow morning, before I inform you whether
or not I shall have seen anything suspicious.""Why, Agricola, you are not here?"resumed Dagobert, in a louder voice."Here I am, father," said the smith, while going out of the sempstress's
apartment, and entering the garret, to his father."I have been to fasten the shutter of a loft that the wind agitated, lest
its noise should disturb you.""Thanks, my boy; but it is not noise that wakes me," said Dagobert,
gayly; "it is an appetite, quite furious, for a chat with you.Oh, my
dear boy, it is the hungering of a proud old man of a father, who has not
seen his son for eighteen years.""Shall I light a candle, father?""No, no; that would be luxurious; let us chat in the dark.It will be a
new pleasure for me to see you to-morrow morning at daybreak.It will be
like seeing you for the first time twice."The door of Agricola's garret
being now closed, Mother Bunch heard nothing more.The poor girl, without undressing, threw herself upon the bed, and closed
not an eye during the night, painfully awaiting the appearance of day, in
order that she might watch over the safety of Agricola.However, in spite
of her vivid anxieties for the morrow, she sometimes allowed herself to
sink into the reveries of a bitter melancholy.She compared the
conversation she had just had in the silence of night, with the man whom
she secretly adored, with what that conversation might have been, had she
possessed some share of charms and beauty--had she been loved as she
loved, with a chaste and devoted flame!But soon sinking into belief that
she should never know the ravishing sweets of a mutual passion, she found
consolation in the hope of being useful to Agricola.At the dawn of day,
she rose softly, and descended the staircase with little noise, in order
to see if anything menaced Agricola from without.The weather, damp and foggy during a portion of the night, became clear
and cold towards morning.Through the glazed skylight of Agricola's
garret, where he lay with his father, a corner of the blue sky could be
seen.The apartment of the young blacksmith had an aspect as poor as the
sewing-girl's.For its sole ornament, over the deal table upon which
Agricola wrote his poetical inspirations, there hung suspended from a
nail in the wall a portrait of Beranger--that immortal poet whom the
people revere and cherish, because his rare and transcendent genius has
delighted to enlighten the people, and to sing their glories and their
reverses.Although the day had only begun to dawn, Dagobert and Agricola had
already risen.The latter had sufficient self command to conceal his
inquietude, for renewed reflection had again increased his fears.The recent outbreak in the Rue des Prouvaires had caused a great number
of precautionary arrests; and the discovery of numerous copies of
Agricola's song, in the possession of one of the chiefs of the
disconcerted plot, was, in truth, calculated slightly to compromise the
young blacksmith.His father, however, as we have already mentioned,
suspected not his secret anguish.Seated by the side of his son, upon the
edge of their mean little bed, the old soldier, by break of day, had
dressed and shaved with military care; he now held between his hands both
those of Agricola, his countenance radiant with joy, and unable to
discontinue the contemplation of his boy."You will laugh at me, my dear boy," said Dagobert to his son; "but I
wished the night to the devil, in order that I might gaze upon you in
full day, as I now see you.But all in good time; I have lost nothing.Here is another silliness of mine; it delights me to see you wear
moustaches.What a splendid horse-grenadier you would have made!Tell me;
have you never had a wish to be a soldier?""That's right," said Dagobert: "and besides, I believe, after all, look
ye, that the time of the sword has gone by.We old fellows are now good
for nothing, but to be put in a corner of the chimney.Like rusty old
carbines, we have had our day.""Yes; your days of heroism and of glory," said Agricola with excitement;
and then he added, with a voice profoundly softened and agitated, "it is
something good and cheering to be your son!""As to the good, I know nothing of that," replied Dagobert; "but as for
the cheering, it ought to be so; for I love you proudly.And I think this
is but the beginning!I am like the famished
wretches who have been some days without food.It is but by little and
little that they recover themselves, and can eat.Now, you may expect to
be tasted, my boy, morning and evening, and devoured during the day.No,
I wish not to think that--not all the day--no, that thought dazzles and
perplexes me; and I am no longer myself."These words of Dagobert caused a painful feeling to Agricola.He believed
that they sprang from a presentiment of the separation with which he was
menaced."Well," continued Dagobert; "you are quite happy; M. Hardy is always good
to you."replied Agricola: "there is none in the world better, or more
equitable and generous!If you knew what wonders he has brought about in
his factory!Compared to all others, it is a paradise beside the stithies
of Lucifer!""You shall see," resumed Agricola, "what welfare, what joy, what
affection, are displayed upon the countenances of all whom he employs;
who work with an ardent pleasure."This M. Hardy of yours must be an out-and-out magician," said Dagobert."He is, father, a very great magician.He has known how to render labor
pleasant and attractive.As for the pleasure, over and above good wages,
he accords to us a portion of his profits according to our deserts;
whence you may judge of the eagerness with which we go to work.And that
is not all: he has caused large, handsome buildings to be erected, in
which all his workpeople find, at less expense than elsewhere, cheerful
and salubrious lodgings, in which they enjoy all the advantages of an
association.But you shall see--I repeat--you shall see!""They have good reason to say, that Paris is the region of wonders,"
observed Dagobert."Well, behold me here again at last, never more to quit you, nor good
mother!""No, father, we will never separate again," said Agricola, stifling a
sigh."My mother and I will both try to make you forget all that you have
suffered."exclaimed Dagobert, "who the deuce has suffered?Look me well
in the face; and see if I have a look of suffering!Since I have put my foot here, I feel myself quite a young man again!You
shall see me march soon: I bet that I tire you out!I wager that in
beholding your black moustache and my gray one, folks will say, behold
father and son!But let us settle what we are to do with the day.You
will write to the father of Marshal Simon, informing him the his
grand-daughters have arrived, and that it is necessary that he should
hasten his return to Paris; for he has charged himself with matters which
are of great importance for them.While you are writing, I will go down
to say good-morning to my wife, and to the dear little ones.Your mother will go to mass; for I perceive that she likes
to be regular at that: the good soul!and
during her absence, we will make a raid together.""Father," said Agricola, with embarrassment, "this morning it is out of
my power to accompany you."said Dagobert; "recollect this is Monday!""Yes, father," said Agricola, hesitatingly; "but I have promised to
attend all the morning in the workshop, to finish a job that is required
in a hurry.If I fail to do so, I shall inflict some injury upon M.
Hardy."That alters the case," said Dagobert, with a sigh of regret."I thought
to make my first parade through Paris with you this morning; but it must
be deferred in favor of your work.It is sacred: since it is that which
sustains your mother.Nevertheless, it is vexatious, devilish vexatious.See how quickly one gets habituated to and
spoilt by happiness.I growl like a true grumbler, at a walk being put
off for a few hours!I who, during eighteen years, have only
hoped to see you once more, without daring to reckon very much upon it!Vive l'amour et cogni--I mean--my
Agricola!"And, to console himself, the old soldier gayly slapped his
son's shoulder.This seemed another omen of evil to the blacksmith; for he dreaded one
moment to another lest the fears of Mother Bunch should be realized."Now
that I have recovered myself," said Dagobert, laughing, "let us speak of
business.Know you where I find the addresses of all the notaries in
Paris?""I don't know; but nothing is more easy than to discover it.""My reason is," resumed Dagobert, "that I sent from Russia by post, and
by order of the mother of the two children that I have brought here, some
important papers to a Parisian notary.As it was my duty to see this
notary immediately upon my arrival, I had written his name and his
address in a portfolio, of which however, I have been robbed during my
journey; and as I have forgotten his devil of a name, it seems to me,
that if I should see it again in the list of notaries, I might recollect
it."Two knocks at the door of the garret made Agricola start.He
involuntarily thought of a warrant for his apprehension.His father, who, at the sound of the knocking turned round his head, had
not perceived his emotion, and said with a loud voice: "Come in!"He wore a black cassock and a broad brimmed
hat.To recognize his brother by adoption, and to throw himself into his arms,
were two movements performed at once by Agricola--as quick as
thought.--"My brother!"Such were the words exchanged between the blacksmith and the missionary,
while they were locked in a close embrace.Dagobert, moved and charmed by these fraternal endearments, felt his eyes
become moist.There was something truly touching in the affection of the
young men--in their hearts so much alike, and yet of characters and
aspects so very different--for the manly countenance of Agricola
contrasted strongly with the delicacy and angelic physiognomy of Gabriel."I was forewarned by my father of your arrival," said the blacksmith at
length."I have been expecting to see you; and my happiness has been a
hundred times the greater, because I have had all the pleasures of hoping
for it."asked Gabriel, in affectionately grasping the hands
of Dagobert."I trust that you have found her in good health."replied Dagobert; "and her health will have become a
hundred times better, now that we are all together.Then addressing himself to Agricola, who, forgetting
his fear of being arrested, regarded the missionary with an expression of
ineffable affection, Dagobert added:

"Let it be remembered, that, with the soft cheek of a young girl, Gabriel
has the courage of a lion; I have already told with what intrepidity he
saved the lives of Marshal Simon's daughters, and tried to save mine
also."suddenly exclaimed
Agricola, who for a few seconds had been attentively examining the
missionary.Gabriel, having thrown aside his hat on entering, was now directly
beneath the skylight of the garret apartment, the bright light through
which shone upon his sweet, pale countenance: and the round scar, which
extended from one eyebrow to the other, was therefore distinctly visible.In the midst of the powerful and diversified emotion, and of the exciting
events which so rapidly followed the shipwreck on the rocky coast near
Cardoville House, Dagobert, during the short interview he then had with
Gabriel, had not perceived the scar which seamed the forehead of the
young missionary.Now, partaking, however, of the surprise of his son,
Dagobert said:

"Aye, indeed!"And on his hands, too; see, dear father!"exclaimed the blacksmith, with
renewed surprise, while he seized one of the hands which the young priest
held out towards him in order to tranquillize his fears."Gabriel, my brave boy, explain this to us!"added Dagobert; "who has
wounded you thus?"and in his turn, taking the other hand of the
missionary, he examined the scar upon it with the eye of a judge of
wounds, and then added, "In Spain, one of my comrades was found and taken
down alive from a cross, erected at the junction of several roads, upon
which the monks had crucified, and left him to die of hunger, thirst, and
agony.Ever afterwards he bore scars upon his hands, exactly similar to
this upon your hand.""It is evident that your hands
have been pierced through!and Agricola became
grievously agitated."Do not think about it," said Gabriel, reddening with the embarrassment
of modesty."Having gone as a missionary amongst the savages of the Rocky
Mountains, they crucified me, and they had begun to scalp me, when
Providence snatched me from their hands.""Unfortunate youth," said Dagobert; "without arms then?You had not a
sufficient escort for your protection?""It is not for such as me to carry arms."said Gabriel, sweetly smiling;
"and we are never accompanied by any escort.""Well, but your companions, those who were along with you, how came it
that they did not defend you?""Yes, alone; without even a guide."exclaimed Dagobert,
scarcely crediting a step so unmilitary, and almost distrusting his own
sense of hearing."The Christian faith," said Gabriel, with mild simplicity, "cannot be
implanted by force or violence.It is only by the power of persuasion
that the gospel can be spread amongst poor savages.""Why, then, dear brother, one has but to die for the belief that is in
him, pitying those who have rejected it, and who have refused the
blessings it offers to mankind."There was a period of profound silence after the reply of Gabriel, which
was uttered with simple and touching pathos.Dagobert was in his own nature too courageous not to comprehend a heroism
thus calm and resigned; and the old soldier, as well as his son, now
contemplated Gabriel with the most earnest feelings of mingled admiration
and respect.Gabriel, entirely free from the affection of false modesty, seemed quite
unconscious of the emotions which he had excited in the breasts of his
two friends; and he therefore said to Dagobert, "What ails you?"exclaimed the brave old soldier, with great emotion:
"After having been for thirty years in the wars, I had imagined myself to
be about as courageous as any man."Thunder, don't you know that the brave wounds there" (the veteran took
with transport both of Gabriel's hands), "that these wounds are as
glorious--are more glorious than our--than all ours, as warriors by
profession!"exclaimed Agricola; and he added,
with enthusiasm, "Oh, for such priests!How I am elevated by their charity, their courage, their
resignation!""I entreat you not to extol me thus," said Gabriel with embarrassment.When I have
gone into the heat of action, did I rush into it alone?Was I not under
the eyes of my commanding officer?Were not my comrades there along with
me?In default of true courage, had I not the instinct of self
preservation to spur me on, without reckoning the excitement of the
shouts and tumult of battle, the smell of the gunpowder, the flourishes
of the trumpets, the thundering of the cannon, the ardor of my horse,
which bounded beneath me as if the devil were at his tail?Need I state
that I also knew that the emperor was present, with his eye upon every
one--the emperor, who, in recompense for a hole being made in my tough
hide, would give me a bit of lace or a ribbon, as plaster for the wound.Thanks to all these causes, I passed for game.But are you
not a thousand times more game than I, my brave boy; going alone,
unarmed, to confront enemies a hundred times more ferocious than those
whom we attacked--we, who fought in whole squadrons, supported by
artillery, bomb-shells, and case-shot?"cried Agricola, "how noble of you to render to
Gabriel this justice!""Oh, dear brother," said Gabriel, "his kindness to me makes him magnify
what was quite natural and simple!"said the veteran soldier; "yes, natural for gallants who have
hearts of the true temper: but that temper is rare.""Oh, yes, very rare," said Agricola; "for that kind of courage is the
most admirable of all.Most bravely did you seek almost certain death,
alone, bearing the cross in hand as your only weapon, to preach charity
and Christian brotherhood.They seized you, tortured you; and you await
death and partly endure it, without complaint, without remonstrance,
without hatred, without anger, without a wish for vengeance; forgiveness
issuing from your mouth, and a smile of pity beaming upon your lips; and
this in the depths of forests, where no one could witness your
magnanimity,--none could behold you--and without other desire, after you
were rescued than modestly to conceal blessed wounds under your black
robe!can you still contend that you are not
as brave as he?""And besides, too," resumed Dagobert, "the dear boy did all that for a
thankless paymaster; for it is true, Agricola, that his wounds will never
change his humble black robe of a priest into the rich robe of a bishop!""I am not so disinterested as I may seem to be," said Gabriel to
Dagobert, smiling meekly."If I am deemed worthy, a great recompense
awaits me on high.""As to all that, my boy," said Dagobert, "I do not understand it; and I
will not argue about it.I maintain it, that my old cross of honor would
be at least as deservedly affixed to your cassock as upon my uniform.""But these recompenses are never conferred upon humble priests like
Gabriel," said Agricola, "and if you did know, dear father, how much
virtue and valor is among those whom the highest orders in the priesthood
insolently call the inferior clergy,--the unseen merit and the blind
devotedness to be found amongst worthy, but obscure, country curates, who
are inhumanly treated and subjugated to a pitiless yoke by the lordly
lawnsleeves!Like us, those poor priests are worthy laborers in their
vocation; and for them, also, all generous hearts ought to demand
enfranchisement!Sons of common people, like ourselves, and useful as we
are, justice ought to be rendered both to them and to us.You will not contradict it; for you have told me, that your
ambition would have been to obtain a small country curacy; because you
understand the good that you could work within it.""My desire is still the same," said Gabriel sadly: "but unfortunately--"
and then, as if he wished to escape from a painful thought, and to change
the conversation, he, addressing himself to Dagobert, added: "Believe me:
be more just than to undervalue your own courage by exalting mine.Your
courage must be very great--very great; for, after a battle, the
spectacle of the carnage must be truly terrible to a generous and feeling
heart.We, at least, though we may be killed, do not kill."At these words of the missionary, the soldier drew himself up erect,
looked upon Gabriel with astonishment, and said, "This is most
surprising!""What Gabriel has just told us," replied Dagobert, "brings to my mind
what I experienced in warfare on the battlefield in proportion as I
advanced in years.Listen, my children: more than once, on the night
after a general engagement, I have been mounted as a vidette,--alone,--by
night,--amid the moonlight, on the field of battle which remained in our
possession, and upon which lay the bodies of seven or eight thousand of
the slain, amongst whom were mingled the slaughtered remains of some of
my old comrades: and then this sad scene, when the profound silence has
restored me to my senses from the thirst for bloodshed and the delirious
whirling of my sword (intoxicated like the rest), I have said to myself,
'for what have these men been killed?--FOR WHAT--FOR WHAT?'But this
feeling, well understood as it was, hindered me not, on the following
morning, when the trumpets again sounded the charge, from rushing once
more to the slaughter.But the same thought always recurred when my arm
became weary with carnage; and after wiping my sabre upon the mane of my
horse, I have said to myself, 'I have killed!--killed!!--killed!!!The missionary and the blacksmith exchanged looks on hearing the old
soldier give utterance to this singular retrospection of the past.said Gabriel to him, "all generous hearts feel as you did during
the solemn moments, when the intoxication of glory has subsided, and man
is left alone to the influence of the good instincts planted in his
bosom.""And that should prove, my brave boy," rejoined Dagobert, "that you are
greatly better than I; for those noble instincts, as you call them, have
never abandoned you.* * * * But how the deuce did you escape from the
claws of the infuriated savages who had already crucified you?"At this question of Dagobert, Gabriel started and reddened so visibly,
that the soldier said to him: "If you ought not or cannot answer my
request, let us say no more about it.""I have nothing to conceal, either from you or from my brother," replied
the missionary with altered voice."Only; it will be difficult for me to
make you comprehend what I cannot comprehend myself.""Surely," said Gabriel, reddening more deeply, "I must have been deceived
by a fallacy of my senses, during that abstracted moment in which I
awaited death with resignation.My enfeebled mind, in spite of me, must
have been cheated by an illusion; or that, which to the present hour has
remained inexplicable, would have been more slowly developed; and I
should have known with greater certainty that it was the strange woman--"

Dagobert, while listening to the missionary, was perfectly amazed; for he
also had vainly tried to account for the unexpected succor which had
freed him and the two orphans from the prison at Leipsic."Of her who saved me," was the reply."A woman saved you from the hands of the savages?""Yes," replied Gabriel, though absorbed in his reflections, "a woman,
young and beautiful!"When I asked her, she replied, 'I am the sister of the
distressed!'"asked Dagobert, singularly
interested."'I go wheresoever there is suffering,' she replied," answered
the missionary; "and she departed, going towards the north of
America--towards those desolate regions in which there is eternal snow,
where the nights are without end.""As in Siberia," said Dagobert, who had become very thoughtful."But," resumed Agricola, addressing himself to Gabriel, who seemed also
to have become more and more absorbed, "in what manner or by what means
did this woman come to your assistance?"The missionary was about to reply to the last question, when there was
heard a gentle tap at the door of the garret apartment, which renewed the
fears that Agricola had forgotten since the arrival of his adopted
brother."Agricola," said a sweet voice outside the door, "I wish to
speak with you as soon as possible."The blacksmith recognized Mother Bunch's voice, and opened the door.But
the young sempstress, instead of entering, drew back into the dark
passage, and said, with a voice of anxiety: "Agricola, it is an hour
since broad day, and you have not yet departed!I have
been watching below, in the street, until now, and have seen nothing
alarming; but they may come any instant to arrest you.Hasten, I conjure
you, your departure for the abode of Miss de Cardoville."Had it not been for the arrival of Gabriel, I should have been gone.But
I could not resist the happiness of remaining some little time with him."said Mother Bunch, with sweet surprise; for, as has been
stated, she had been brought up with him and Agricola."Yes," answered Agricola, "for half an hour he has been with my father
and me.""What happiness I shall have in seeing him again," said the sewing-girl."He doubtless came upstairs while I had gone for a brief space to your
mother, to ask if I could be useful in any way on account of the young
ladies; but they have been so fatigued that they still sleep.Your mother
has requested me to give you this letter for your father."Well," resumed Mother Bunch, "now that you have seen Gabriel, do not
delay long.Think what a blow it would be for your father, if they came
to arrest you in his very presence mon Dieu!""You are right," said Agricola; "it is indispensable that I should
depart--while near Gabriel in spite of my anxiety, my fears were
forgotten.""Go quickly, then; and if Miss de Cardoville should grant this favor,
perhaps in a couple of hours you will return, quite at ease both as to
yourself and us."a very few minutes more; and I'll come down."I'll come up
again to apprise you.Mother Bunch hurriedly descended the staircase,
to resume her watch at the street door, and Agricola re-entered his
garret."Dear father," he said to Dagobert, "my mother has just received
this letter, and she requests you to read it.""Very well; read it for me, my boy."And Agricola read as follows:

"MADAME.--I understand that your husband has been charged by General Simon
with an affair of very great importance.Will you, as soon as your
husband arrives in Paris, request him to come to my office at Chartres
without a moment's delay.I am instructed to deliver to himself, and to
no other person, some documents indispensable to the interests of General
Simon."DURAND, Notary at Chartres."Dagobert looked at his son with astonishment, and said to him, "Who can
have told this gentleman already of my arrival in Paris?""Perhaps, father," said Agricola, "this is the notary to whom you
transmitted some papers, and whose address you have lost.""But his name was not Durand; and I distinctly recollect that his address
was Paris, not Chartres.And, besides," said the soldier, thoughtfully,
"if he has some important documents, why didn't he transmit them to me?""It seems to me that you ought not to neglect going to him as soon as
possible," said Agricola, secretly rejoiced that this circumstance would
withdraw his father for about two days, during which time his
(Agricola's) fate would be decided in one way or other."Your counsel is good," replied his father."This thwarts your intentions in some degree?""Rather, my lads; for I counted upon passing the day with you.Having come happily from Siberia to Paris, it
is not for me to fear a journey from Paris to Chartres, when it is
required on an affair of importance.In twice twenty-four hours I shall
be back again.But the deuce take me if I expected to leave Paris for
Chartres to-day.Luckily, I leave Rose and Blanche with my good wife; and
Gabriel, their angel, as they call him, will be here to keep them
company.""That is, unfortunately, impossible," said the missionary, sadly."This
visit on my arrival is also a farewell visit."exclaimed Dagobert and Agricola both at once.said Dagobert; "surely it is not
possible?""I must answer no question upon this subject," said Gabriel, suppressing
a sigh: "but from now, for some time, I cannot, and ought not, come again
into this house.""Why, my brave boy," resumed Dagobert with emotion, "there is something
in thy conduct that savors of constraint, of oppression.He you call superior, whom I saw for some moments after the
shipwreck at Cardoville Castle, has a bad look; and I am sorry to see you
enrolled under such a commander."exclaimed Agricola, struck with the identity of
the name with that of the young lady of the golden hair; "was it in
Cardoville Castle that you were received after your shipwreck?""Yes, my boy; why, does that astonish you?""Nothing father; but were the owners of the castle there at the time?""No; for the steward, when I applied to him for an opportunity to return
thanks for the kind hospitality we had experienced, informed me that the
person to whom the house belonged was resident at Paris.""What a singular coincidence," thought Agricola, "if the young lady
should be the proprietor of the dwelling which bears her name!"This reflection having recalled to Agricola the promise which he had made
to Mother Bunch, he said to Dagobert; "Dear father, excuse me; but it is
already late, and I ought to be in the workshop by eight o'clock."This party is adjourned till my
return from Chartres.Embrace me once more, and take care of yourself."Since Dagobert had spoken of constraint and oppression to Gabriel, the
latter had continued pensive.At the moment when Agricola approached him
to shake hands, and to bid him adieu, the missionary said to him
solemnly, with a grave voice, and in a tone of decision that astonished
both the blacksmith and the soldier: "My dear brother, one word more.I
have come here to say to you also that within a few days hence I shall
have need of you; and of you also, my father (permit me so to call you),"
added Gabriel, with emotion, as he turned round to Dagobert.exclaimed Agricola; "what is the matter?""Yes," replied Gabriel, "I need the advice and assistance of two men of
honor--of two men of resolution;--and I can reckon upon you two--can I
not?At any hour, on whatever day it may be, upon a word from me, will
you come?"Dagobert and his son regarded each other in silence, astonished at the
accents of the missionary.Agricola felt an oppression of the heart.If
he should be a prisoner when his brother should require his assistance,
what could be done?"At every hour, by night or by day, my brave boy, you may depend upon
us," said Dagobert, as much surprised as interested--"You have a father
and a brother; make your own use of them.""Thanks, thanks," said Gabriel, "you set me quite at ease.""I'll tell you what," resumed the soldier, "were it not for your priest's
robe, I should believe, from the manner in which you have spoken to us,
that you are about to be engaged in a duel--in a mortal combat.""Yes; it may be a duel--uncommon and
fearful--at which it is necessary to have two witnesses such as you--A
FATHER and A BROTHER!"Some instants afterwards, Agricola, whose anxiety was continually
increasing, set off in haste for the dwelling of Mademoiselle de
Cardoville, to which we now beg leave to take the reader.Dizier House was one of the largest and handsomest in the Rue Babylone,
in Paris.Nothing could be more severe, more imposing, or more depressing
than the aspect of this old mansion.Several immense windows, filled with
small squares of glass, painted a grayish white, increased the sombre
effect of the massive layers of huge stones, blackened by time, of which
the fabric was composed.This dwelling bore a resemblance to all the others that had been erected
in the same quarter towards the middle of the last century.It was
surmounted in front by a pediment; it had an elevated ground floor, which
was reached from the outside by a circular flight of broad stone steps.One of the fronts looked on an immense court-yard, on each side of which
an arcade led to the vast interior departments.The other front
overlooked the garden, or rather park, of twelve or fifteen roods; and,
on this side, wings, approaching the principal part of the structure,
formed a couple of lateral galleries.Like nearly all the other great
habitations of this quarter, there might be seen at the extremity of the
garden, what the owners and occupiers of each called the lesser mansion.This extension was a Pompadour summer-house, built in the form of a
rotunda, with the charming though incorrect taste of the era of its
erection.It presented, in every part where it was possible for the
stones to be cut, a profusion of endives, knots of ribbons, garlands of
flowers, and chubby cupids.This pavilion, inhabited by Adrienne de
Cardoville was composed of a ground floor, which was reached by a
peristyle of several steps.A small vestibule led to a circular hall,
lighted from the roof.Four principal apartments met here; and ranges of
smaller rooms, concealed in the upper story, served for minor purposes.These dependencies of great habitations are in our days disused, or
transformed into irregular conservatories; but by an uncommon exception,
the black exterior of the pavilion had been scraped and renewed, and the
entire structure repaired.The white stones of which it was built
glistened like Parian marble; and its renovated, coquettish aspect
contrasted singularly with the gloomy mansion seen at the other extremity
of an extensive lawn, on which were planted here and there gigantic
clumps of verdant trees.The following scene occurred at this residence on the morning following
that of the arrival of Dagobert, with the daughters of Marshal Simon, in
the Rue Brise-Miche.The hour of eight had sounded from the steeple of a
neighboring church; a brilliant winter sun arose to brighten a pure blue
sky behind the tall leafless trees, which in summer formed a dome of
verdure over the summer-house.The door in the vestibule opened, and the
rays of the morning sun beamed upon a charming creature, or rather upon
two charming creatures, for the second one, though filling a modest place
in the scale of creation, was not less distinguished by beauty of its
own, which was very striking.In plain terms two individuals, one of them
a young girl, and the other a tiny English dog, of great beauty, of that
breed of spaniels called King Charles's, made their appearance under the
peristyle of the rotunda.The name of the young girl was Georgette; the
beautiful little spaniel's was Frisky.Georgette was in her eighteenth
year.Never had Florine or Manton, never had a lady's maid of Marivaux, a
more mischievous face, an eye more quick, a smile more roguish, teeth
more white, cheeks more roseate, figure more coquettish, feet smaller, or
form smarter, attractive, and enticing.Though it was yet very early,
Georgette was carefully and tastefully dressed.A tiny Valenciennes cap,
with flaps and flap-band, of half peasant fashion, decked with
rose- ribbons, and stuck a little backward upon bands of beautiful
fair hair, surrounded her fresh and piquant face; a robe of gray
levantine, and a cambric neck-kerchief, fastened to her bosom by a large
tuft of rose- ribbons, displayed her figure elegantly rounded; a
hollands apron, white as snow, trimmed below by three large hems,
surmounted by a Vandyke-row, encircled her waist, which was as round and
flexible as a reed; her short, plain sleeves, edged with bone lace,
allowed her plump arms to be seen, which her long Swedish gloves,
reaching to the elbow, defended from the rigor of the cold.When
Georgette raised the bottom of her dress, in order to descend more
quickly the steps, she exhibited to Frisky's indifferent eyes a beautiful
ankle, and the beginning of the plump calf of a fine leg, encased in
white silk, and a charming little foot, in a laced half-boot of Turkish
satin.When a blonde like Georgette sets herself to be ensnaring; when
vivid glances sparkle from her eyes of bright yet tender blue; when a
joyous excitement suffuses her transparent skin, she is more resistless
for the conquest of everything before her than a brunette.This bewitching and nimble lady's-maid, who on the previous evening had
introduced Agricola to the pavilion, was first waiting woman to the
Honorable Miss Adrienne de Cardoville, niece of the Princess Saint
Dizier.Frisky, so happily found and brought back by the blacksmith, uttered weak
but joyful barks, and bounded, ran, and frolicked upon the turf.She was
not much bigger than one's fist; her curled hair, of lustrous black,
shone like ebony, under the broad, red satin ribbon which encircled her
neck; her paws, fringed with long silken fur, were of a bright and fiery
tan, as well as her muzzle, the nose of which was inconceivably pug; her
large eyes were full of intelligence; and her curly ears so long that
they trailed upon the ground.Georgette seemed to be as brisk and
petulant as Frisky, and shared her sportiveness,--now scampering after
the happy little spaniel, and now retreating, in order to be pursued upon
the greensward in her turn.All at once, at the sight of a second person,
who advanced with deliberate gravity, Georgette and Frisky were suddenly
stopped in their diversion.The little King Charles, some steps in
advance of Georgette, faithful to her name, and bold as the devil, held
herself firmly upon her nervous paws, and fiercely awaited the coming up
of the enemy, displaying at the same time rows of little teeth, which,
though of ivory, were none the less pointed and sharp.The enemy
consisted of a woman of mature age, accompanied by a very fat dog, of the
color of coffee and milk; his tail was twisted like a corkscrew; he was
pot-bellied; his skin was sleek; his neck was turned little to one side;
he walked with his legs inordinately spread out, and stepped with the air
of a doctor.His black muzzle, quarrelsome and scowling showed two fangs
sallying forth, and turning up from the left side of the mouth, and
altogether he had an expression singularly forbidding and vindictive.This disagreeable animal, a perfect type of what might be called a
"church-goer's pug," answered to the name of "My Lord."His mistress, a
woman of about fifty years of age, corpulent and of middle size, was
dressed in a costume as gloomy and severe as that of Georgette was gay
and showy.It consisted of a brown robe, a black silk mantle, and a hat
of the same dye.The features of this woman might have been agreeable in
her youth; and her florid cheeks, her correct eyebrows, her black eyes,
which were still very lively, scarcely accorded with the peevish and
austere physiognomy which she tried to assume.This matron, of slow and
discreet gait, was Madame Augustine Grivois, first woman to the Princess
Saint-Dizier.Not only did the age, the face, and the dress of these two
women present a striking contrast; but the contrast extended itself even
to the animals which attended them.There were similar differences
between Frisky and My Lord, as between Georgette and Mrs.When
the latter perceived the little King Charles, she could not restrain a
movement of surprise and repugnance, which escaped not the notice of the
young lady's maid.Frisky, who had not retreated one inch, since the
apparition of My Lord, regarded him valiantly, with a look of defiance,
and even advanced towards him with an air so decidedly hostile, that the
cur, though thrice as big as the little King Charles, uttered a howl of
distress and terror, and sought refuge behind Mrs.Grivois, who bitterly
said to Georgette:

"It seems to me, miss, that you might dispense with exciting your dog
thus, and setting him upon mine.""It was doubtless for the purpose of protecting this respectable but ugly
animal from similar alarms, that you tried to make us lose Frisky
yesterday, by driving her into the street through the little garden gate.But fortunately an honest young man found Frisky in the Rue de Babylone,
and brought her back to my mistress.However," continued Georgette, "to
what, madame, do I owe the pleasure of seeing you this morning?""I am commanded by the Princess," replied Mrs.Grivois, unable to conceal
a smile of triumphant satisfaction, "immediately to see Miss Adrienne.It
regards a very important affair, which I am to communicate only to
herself."At these words Georgette became purple, and could not repress a slight
start of disquietude, which happily escaped Grivois, who was occupied
with watching over the safety of her pet, whom Frisky continued to snarl
at with a very menacing aspect; and Georgette, having quickly overcome
her temporary emotion, firmly answered: "Miss Adrienne went to rest very
late last night.She has forbidden me to enter her apartment before mid
day.""That is very possible: but as the present business is to obey an order
of the Princess her aunt, you will do well if you please, miss, to awaken
your mistress immediately.""My mistress is subject to no one's orders in her own house; and I will
not disturb her till mid-day, in pursuance of her commands," replied
Georgette."Then I shall go myself," said Mrs."Florine and Hebe will not admit you.Indeed, here is the key of the
saloon; and through the saloon only can the apartments of Miss Adrienne
be entered."do you dare refuse me permission to execute the orders of the
Princess?""Yes; I dare to commit the great crime of being unwilling to awaken my
mistress!"such are the results of the blind affection of the Princess for her
niece," said the matron, with affected grief: "Miss Adrienne no longer
respects her aunt's orders; and she is surrounded by young hare-brained
persons, who, from the first dawn of morning, dress themselves out as if
for ball-going."how came you to revile dress, who were formerly the greatest
coquette and the most frisky and fluttering of all the Princess's women.At least, that is what is still spoken of you in the hotel, as having
been handed down from time out of mind, by generation to generation, even
unto ours!"do you mean to insinuate that I am a
hundred years old, Miss Impertinence?""I speak of the generations of waiting-women; for, except you, it is the
utmost if they remain two or three years in the Princess's house, who has
too many tempers for the poor girls!""I forbid you to speak thus of my mistress, whose name some people ought
not to pronounce but on their knees.""However," said Georgette, "if one wished to speak ill of--"

"Do you dare!""No longer ago than last night, at half past eleven o'clock--"

"Last night?""A four-wheeler," continued Georgette, "stopped at a few paces from the
house.A mysterious personage, wrapped up in a cloak, alighted from it,
and directly tapped, not at the door, but on the glass of the porter's
lodge window; and at one o'clock in the morning, the cab was still
stationed in the street, waiting for the mysterious personage in the
cloak, who, doubtless, during all that time, was, as you say, pronouncing
the name of her Highness the Princess on his knees."Grivois had not been instructed as to a visit made to the
Princess Saint-Dizier by Rodin (for he was the man in the cloak), in the
middle of the night, after he had become certain of the arrival in Paris
of General Simon's daughters; or whether Mrs.Grivois thought it
necessary to appear ignorant of the visit, she replied, shrugging her
shoulders disdainfully: "I know not what you, mean, madame.I have not
come here to listen to your impertinent stuff.Once again I ask you--will
you, or will you not, introduce me to the presence of Miss Adrienne?""I repeat, madame, that my mistress sleeps, and that she has forbidden me
to enter her bed-chamber before mid-day."This conversation took place at some distance from the summer-house, at a
spot from which the peristyle could be seen at the end of a grand avenue,
terminating in trees arranged in form of a V. All at once Mrs.Grivois,
extending her hand in that direction, exclaimed: "Great heavens!"I saw her run up the porch steps.I perfectly recognized her by her
gait, by her hat, and by her mantle.To come home at eight o'clock in the
morning!"Grivois: "it is perfectly incredible!"and Georgette burst out into
fits of laughter: and then said: "Oh!you wish to out-do my
story of the four-wheeler last night!Grivois, "that I have this moment seen--"

"Oh!Grivois: if you speak seriously, you are mad!"The little gate that
open's on the street lets one into the quincunx near the pavilion.It is
by that door, doubtless, that mademoiselle has re-entered.her presentiments
have not yet been mistaken.See to what her weak indulgence of her
niece's caprices has led her!It is monstrous!--so monstrous, that,
though I have seen her with my own eyes, still I can scarcely believe
it!""Since you've gone so far, ma'am, I now insist upon conducting you into
the apartment of my lady, in order that you may convince yourself, by
your own senses, that your eyes have deceived you!""Oh, you are very cunning, my dear, but not more cunning than I!Yes, yes, I believe you: you are certain that by
this time I shall find her in her apartment!""But, madame, I assure you--"

"All that I can say to you is this: that neither you, nor Florine, nor
Hebe, shall remain here twenty-four hours.The Princess will put an end
to this horrible scandal; for I shall immediately inform her of what has
passed.Re-enter at eight o'clock in the morning!Why, I am all in a whirl!Certainly, if I had not seen it with my own
eyes, I could not have believed it!Still, it is only what was to be
expected.All those to whom I am
going to relate it, will say, I am quite sure, that it is not at all
astonishing!Grivois returned precipitately towards the mansion, followed by her
fat pug, who appeared to be as embittered as herself.Georgette, active and light, ran, on her part, towards the pavilion, in
order to apprise Miss de Cardoville that Mrs.Grivois had seen her, or
fancied she had seen her, furtively enter by the little garden gate.ADRIENNE AT HER TOILET.Grivois had seen or pretended to
have seen Adrienne de Cardoville re-enter in the morning the extension of
Saint-Dizier House.It is for the purpose, not of excusing, but of rendering intelligible,
the following scenes, that it is deemed necessary to bring out into the
light some striking peculiarities in the truly original character of Miss
de Cardoville.This originality consisted in an excessive independence of mind, joined
to a natural horror of whatsoever is repulsive or deformed, and to an
insatiable desire of being surrounded by everything attractive and
beautiful.The painter most delighted with coloring and beauty, the
sculptor most charmed by proportions of form, feel not more than Adrienne
did the noble enthusiasm which the view of perfect beauty always excites
in the chosen favorites of nature.And it was not only the pleasures of sight which this young lady loved to
gratify: the harmonious modulations of song, the melody of instruments,
the cadences of poetry, afforded her infinite pleasures; while a harsh
voice or a discordant noise made her feel the same painful impression, or
one nearly as painful as that which she involuntarily experienced from
the sight of a hideous object.Passionately fond of flowers, too, and of
their sweet scents, there are some perfumes which she enjoyed equally
with the delights of music or those of plastic beauty.It is necessary,
alas, to acknowledge one enormity: Adrienne was dainty in her food!She
valued more than any one else the fresh pulp of handsome fruit, the
delicate savor of a golden pheasant, cooked to a turn, and the odorous
cluster of a generous vine.But Adrienne enjoyed all these pleasures with an exquisite reserve.She
sought religiously to cultivate and refine the senses given her.She
would have deemed it black ingratitude to blunt those divine gifts by
excesses, or to debase them by unworthy selections of objects upon which
to exercise them; a fault from which, indeed, she was preserved by the
excessive and imperious delicacy of her taste.The BEAUTIFUL and the UGLY occupied for her the places which GOOD and
EVIL holds for others.Her devotion to grace, elegance, and physical beauty, had led her also to
the adoration of moral beauty; for if the expression of a low and bad
passion render uncomely the most beautiful countenances, those which are
in themselves the most ugly are ennobled, on the contrary, by the
expression of good feelings and generous sentiments.In a word, Adrienne was the most complete, the most ideal personification
of SENSUALITY--not of vulgar, ignorant, non intelligent, mistaken
sensuousness which is always deceit ful and corrupted by habit or by the
necessity for gross and ill-regulated enjoyments, but that exquisite
sensuality which is to the senses what intelligence is to the soul.The independence of this young lady's character was extreme.Certain
humiliating subjections imposed upon her success by its social position,
above all things were revolting to her, and she had the hardihood to
resolve to withdraw herself from them.She was a woman, the most womanish
that it is possible to imagine--a woman in her timidity as well as in her
audacity--a woman in her hatred of the brutal despotism of men, as well
as in her intense disposition to self-devoting herself, madly even and
blindly, to him who should merit such a devotion from her--a woman whose
piquant wit was occasionally paradoxical--a superior woman, in brief, who
entertained a well-grounded disdain and contempt for certain men either
placed very high or greatly adulated, whom she had from time to time met
in the drawing-room of her aunt, the Princess Saint-Dizier, when she
resided with her.These indispensable explanations being given, we usher, the reader into
the presence of Adrienne de Cardoville, who had just come out of the
bath.It would require all the brilliant colorings of the Venetian school to
represent that charming scene, which would rather seem to have occurred
in the sixteenth century, in some palace of Florence or Bologna, than in
Paris, in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, in the month of February, 1832.Adrienne's dressing-room was a kind of miniature temple seemingly one
erected and dedicated to the worship of beauty, in gratitude to the Maker
who has lavished so many charms upon woman, not to be neglected by her,
or to cover and conceal them with ashes, or to destroy them by the
contact of her person with sordid and harsh haircloth; but in order that,
with fervent gratitude for the divine gifts wherewith she is endowed, she
may enhance her charms with all the illusions of grace and all the
splendors of apparel, so as to glorify the divine work of her own
perfections in the eyes of all.Daylight was admitted into this
semicircular apartment, through one of those double windows, contrived
for the preservation of heat, so happily imported from Germany.The walls
of the pavilion being constructed of stone of great thickness, the depth
of the aperture for the windows was therefore very great.That of
Adrienne's dressing-room was closed on the outside by a sash containing a
single large pane of plate glass, and within, by another large plate of
ground glass.In the interval or space of about three feet left between
these two transparent enclosures, there was a case or box filled with
furze mould, whence sprung forth climbing plants, which, directed round
the ground glass, formed a rich garland of leaves and flowers.A garnet
damask tapestry, rich with harmoniously blended arabesques, in the purest
style, covered the walls and a thick carpet of similar color was extended
over the floor: and this sombre ground, presented by the floor and walls,
marvellously enhanced the effects of all the harmonious ornaments and
decorations of the chamber.Under the window, opposite to the south, was placed Adrienne's dressing
case, a real masterpiece of the skill of the goldsmith.Upon a large
tablet of lapis-lazuli, there were scattered boxes of jewels, their lids
precisely enamelled; several scent boxes of rock crystal, and other
implements and utensils of the toilet, some formed of shells, some of
mother-of-pearl, and others of ivory, covered with ornaments of gold in
extraordinary taste.Two large figures, modelled in silver with antique
purity; supported an oval swing mirror, which had for its rim, in place
of a frame curiously carved, a fresh garland of natural flowers, renewed
every day like a nosegay for a ball.Two enormous Japanese vases, of purple and gold, three feet each in
diameter, were placed upon the carpet on each side of the toilet, and,
filled with camellias, ibiscures, and cape jasmine, in full flower formed
a sort of grove, diversified with the most brilliant colors.At the
farther end of the apartment, opposite the casement, was to be seen,
surrounded by another mass of flowers, a reduction in white marble of the
enchanting group of Daphnis and Chloe, the more chaste ideal of graceful
modesty and youthful beauty.Two golden lamps burned perfumes upon the same pedestal which supported
those two charming figures.A coffer of frosted silver, set off with
small figures in jewelry and precious stones, and supported on four feet
of gilt bronze, contained various necessaries for the toilette; two
frosted Psyches, decorated with diamond ear-rings; some excellent
drawings from Raphael and Titian, painted by Adrienne herself, consisting
of portraits of both men and women of exquisite beauty; several consoles
of oriental jasper, supporting ewers and basins of silver and of silver
gilt, richly chased and filled with scented waters; a voluptuously rich
divan, some seats, and an illuminated gilt fable, completed the furniture
of this chamber, the atmosphere of which was impregnated with the
sweetest perfumes.Adrienne, whom her attendants had just helped from the bath, was seated
before her toilette, her three women surrounding her.By a caprice, or
rather by a necessary and logical impulse of her soul, filled as it was
with the love of beauty and of harmony in all things, Adrienne had wished
the young women who served her to be very pretty, and be dressed with
attention and with a charming originality.We have already seen
Georgette, a piquante blonde, attired in her attractive costume of an
intriguing lady's maid of Marivaux; and her two companions were quite
equal to her both in gracefulness and gentility.One of them, named Florine, a tall, delicately slender, and elegant girl,
with the air and form of Diana Huntress, was of a pale brown complexion.Her thick black hair was turned up behind, where it was fastened with a
long golden pin.Like the two other girls, her arms were uncovered to
facilitate the performance of her duties about and upon the person of her
charming mistress.She wore a dress of that gay green so familiar to the
Venetian painters.Her slender waist curved
in from under the plaits of a tucker of white cambric, plaited in five
minute folds, and fastened by five gold buttons.The third of Adrienne's
women had a face so fresh and ingenuous, a waist so delicate, so
pleasing, and so finished, that her mistress had given her the name of
Hebe.Her dress of a delicate rose color, and Grecian cut, displayed her
charming neck, and her beautiful arms up to the very shoulders.The
physiognomy of these three young women was laughter loving and happy.On
their features there was no expression of that bitter sullenness, willing
and hated obedience, or offensive familiarity, or base and degraded
deference, which are the ordinary results of a state of servitude.In the
zealous eagerness of the cares and attentions which they lavished upon
Adrienne, there seemed to be at least as much of affection as of
deference and respect.They appeared to derive an ardent pleasure from
the services which they rendered to their lovely mistress.One would have
thought that they attached to the dressing and embellishment of her
person all the merits and the enjoyment arising from the execution of a
work of art, in the accomplishing of which, fruitful of delights, they
were stimulated by the passions of love, of pride, and of joy.The sun beamed brightly upon the toilet-case, placed in front of the
window.Adrienne was seated on a chair, its back elevated a little more
than usual.She was enveloped in a long morning-gown of blue silk,
embroidered with a leaf of the same color, which was fitted close to her
waist, as exquisitely slender and delicate as that of a child of twelve
years, by a girdle with floating tags.Her neck, delicately slender and
flexible as a bird's, was uncovered, as were also her shoulders and arms,
and all were of incomparable beauty.Despite the vulgarity of the
comparison, the purest ivory alone can give an idea of the dazzling
whiteness of her polished satin skin, of a texture so fresh and so firm,
that some drops of water, collected and still remaining about the roots
of her hair from the bath, rolled in serpentine lines over her shoulders,
like pearls, or beads, of crystal, over white marble.And what gave enhanced lustre to this wondrous carnation, known but to
auburn-headed beauties, was the deep purple of her, humid lips,--the
roseate transparency of her small ears, of her dilated nostrils, and her
nails, as bright and glossy, as if they had been varnished.In every
spot, indeed, where her pure arterial blood, full of animation and heat,
could make its way to the skin and shine through the surface, it
proclaimed her high health and the vivid life and joyous buoyancy of her
glorious youth.Her eyes were very large, and of a velvet softness.Now
they glanced, sparkling and shining with comic humor or intelligence and
wit; and now they widened and extended themselves, languishing and
swimming between their double fringes of long crisp eyelashes, of as deep
a black as her finely-drawn and exquisitely arched eyebrows; for, by a
delightful freak of nature, she had black eyebrows and eyelashes to
contrast with the golden red of her hair.Her forehead, small like those
of ancient Grecian statues, formed with the rest of her face a perfect
oval.Her nose, delicately curved, was slightly aquiline; the enamel of
her teeth glistened when the light fell upon them; and her vermeil mouth
voluptuously sensual, seemed to call for sweet kisses, and the gay smiles
and delectations of dainty and delicious pleasure.It is impossible to
behold or to conceive a carriage of the head freer, more noble, or more
elegant than hers; thanks to the great distance which separated the neck
and the ear from their attachment to her outspread and dimpled shoulders.We have already said that Adrienne was red-haired; but it was the redness
of many of the admirable portraits of women by Titian and Leonardo da
Vinci,--that is to say, molten gold presents not reflections more
delightfully agreeable or more glittering, than the naturally undulating
mass of her very long hair, as soft and fine as silk, so long, that, when
let loose, it reached the floor; in it, she could wholly envelop herself,
like another Venus arising from the sea.At the present moment,
Adrienne's tresses were ravishing to behold; Georgette, her arms bare,
stood behind her mistress, and had carefully collected into one of her
small white hands, those splendid threads whose naturally ardent
brightness was doubled in the sunshine.When the pretty lady's-maid
pulled a comb of ivory into the midst of the undulating and golden waves
of that enormously magnificent skein of silk, one might have said that a
thousand sparks of fire darted forth and coruscated away from it in all
directions.The sunshine, too, reflected not less golden and fiery rays
from numerous clusters of spiral ringlets, which, divided upon Adrienne's
forehead, fell over her cheeks, and in their elastic flexibility caressed
the risings of her snowy bosom, to whose charming undulations they
adapted and applied themselves.Whilst Georgette, standing, combed the
beautiful locks of her mistress, Hebe, with one knee upon the floor, and
having upon the other the sweet little foot of Miss Cardoville, busied
herself in fitting it with a remarkably small shoe of black satin, and
crossed its slender ties over a silk stocking of a pale yet rosy flesh
color, which imprisoned the smallest and finest ankle in the world.Florine, a little farther back, presented to her mistress, in a jeweled
box, a perfumed paste, with which Adrienne slightly rubbed her dazzling
hands and outspread fingers, which seemed tinted with carmine to their
extremities.Let us not forget Frisky, who, couched in the lap of her
mistress, opened her great eyes with all her might, and seemed to observe
the different operations of Adrienne's toilette with grave and reflective
attention.A silver bell being sounded from without, Florine, at a sign
from her mistress, went out and presently returned, bearing a letter upon
a small silver-gilt salve.Adrienne, while her women continued fitting on
her shoes, dressing her hair, and arranging her in her habiliments, took
the letter, which was written by the steward of the estate of Cardoville,
and read aloud as follows:

"HONORED MADAME,

"Knowing your goodness of heart and generosity, I venture to address you
with respectful confidence.During twenty years I served the late Count
and Duke of Cardoville, your noble father, I believe I may truly say,
with probity and zeal.The castle is now sold; so that I and my wife, in
our old age, behold ourselves about to be dismissed, and left destitute
of all resources: which, alas!said Adrienne, interrupting herself in reading: "my
father, certainly, always prided himself upon their devotion to him, and
their probity."She continued:

"There does, indeed, remain to us a means of retaining our place here;
but it would constrain us to be guilty of baseness; and, be the
consequences to us what they may, neither I nor my wife wish to purchase
our bread at such a price.""Good, very good," said Adrienne, "always the same--dignity even in
poverty--it is the sweet perfume of a flower, not the less sweet because
it has bloomed in a meadow.""In order to explain to you, honored madame, the unworthy task exacted
from us, it is necessary to inform you, in the first place, that M. Rodin
came here from Paris two days ago."said Mademoiselle de Cardoville, interrupting herself
anew; "the secretary of Abbe d'Aigrigny!I am not at all surprised at him
being engaged in a perfidious or black intrigue."M. Rodin came from Paris to announce to us that the estate was sold, and
that he was sure of being able to obtain our continuance in our place, if
we would assist him in imposing a priest not of good character upon the
new proprietress as her future confessor; and if, the better to attain
this end, we would consent to calumniate another priest, a deserving and
excellent man, much loved and much respected in the country.I was required to write twice or thrice a week to M. Rodin, and
to relate to him everything that should occur in the house.I ought to
acknowledge, honored madame, that these infamous proposals were as much
as possible disguised and dissimulated under sufficiently specious
pretexts; but, notwithstanding the aspect which with more or less skill
it was attempted to give to the affair, it was precisely and
substantially what I have now had the honor of stating to you.""Corruption, calumny, and false and treacherous impeachment!"said
Adrienne, with disgust: "I cannot think of such wretches without
involuntarily feeling my mind shocked by dismal ideas of black, venomous,
and vile reptiles, of aspects most hideous indeed.How much more do I
love to dwell upon the consoling thought of honest Dupont and his wife!"Adrienne proceeded:

"Believe me, we hesitated not an instant.We quit Cardoville, which has
been our home for the last twenty years;--but we shall quit it like
honest people, and with the consciousness of our integrity.And now,
honored madame, if, in the brilliant circle in which you move--you, who
are so benevolent and amiable--could find a place for us by your
recommendation, then, with endless gratitude to you, we shall escape from
a position of most cruel embarrassment.""Surely, surely," said Adrienne, "they shall not in vain appeal to me.To
wrest excellent persons from the grip of M. Rodin, is not only a duty but
a pleasure: for it is at once a righteous and a dangerous enterprise; and
dearly do I love to brave powerful oppressors!"Adrienne again went on
reading:

"After having thus spoken to you of ourselves, honored madame, permit us
to implore your protection for other unfortunates; for it would be wicked
to think only of one's self.Three days ago, two shipwrecks took place
upon our ironbound coast.A few passengers only were saved, and were
conducted hither, where I and my wife gave them all necessary attentions.All these passengers have departed for Paris, except one, who still
remains, his wounds having hitherto prevented him from leaving the house,
and, indeed, they will constrain him to remain for some days to come.He
is a young East Indian prince, of about twenty years of age, and he
appears to be as amiable and good as he is handsome, which is not a
little to say, though he has a tawny skin, like the rest of his
countrymen, as I understand."exclaimed Adrienne, gayly; "this is quite delightful, and not at all of
an ordinary or vulgar nature!this Indian prince has already awakened
all my sympathies!But what can I do with this Adonis from the banks of
the Ganges, who has come to wreck himself upon the Picardy coast?"Adrienne's three women looked at her with much astonishment, though they
were accustomed to the singular eccentricities of her character.Georgette and Hebe even indulged in discreet and restrained smiles.Florine, the tall and beautiful pale brown girl, also smiled like her
pretty companions; but it was after a short pause of seeming reflection,
as if she had previously been entirely engrossed in listening to and
recollecting the minutest words of her mistress, who, though powerfully
interested by the situation of the "Adonis from Ganges banks," as she had
called him, continued to read Dupont's letter:

"One of the countrymen of the Indian prince, who has also remained to
attend upon him, has given me to understand that the youthful prince has
lost in the shipwreck all he possessed, and knows not how to get to
Paris, where his speedy presence is required by some affairs of the very
greatest importance.It is not from the prince himself that I have
obtained this information: no; he appears to be too dignified and proud
to proclaim of his fate: but his countryman, more communicative,
confidentially told me what I have stated, adding, that his young
compatriot has already been subjected to great calamities, and that his
father, who was the sovereign of an Indian kingdom, has been killed by
the English, who have also dispossessed his son of his crown.""This is very singular," said Adrienne, thoughtfully."These
circumstances recall to my mind that my father often mentioned that one
of our relations was espoused in India by a native monarch; and that
General Simon: (whom they have created a marshal) had entered into his
service."Then interrupting herself to indulge in a smile, she added,
"Gracious!this affair will be quite odd and fantastical!Such things
happen to nobody but me; and then people say that I am the uncommon
creature!But it seems to me that it is not I, but Providence, which, in
truth, sometimes shows itself very eccentric!But let us see if worthy
Dupont gives the name of this handsome prince?""We trust, honored madame, that you will pardon our boldness: but we
should have thought ourselves very selfish, if, while stating to you our
own griefs, we had not also informed you that there is with us a brave
and estimable prince involved in so much distress.In fine, lady, trust
to me; I am old; and I have had much experience of men; and it was only
necessary to see the nobleness of expression and the sweetness of
countenance of this young Indian, to enable me to judge that he is worthy
of the interest which I have taken the liberty to request in his behalf.It would be sufficient to transmit to him a small sum of money for the
purchase of some European clothing; for he has lost all his Indian
vestments in the shipwreck."Heaven preserve him from that; and me also!Chance has sent
hither from the heart of India, a mortal so far favored as never to have
worn the abominable European costume--those hideous habits, and frightful
hats, which render the men so ridiculous, so ugly, that in truth there is
not a single good quality to be discovered in them, nor one spark of what
can either captivate or attract!There comes to me at last a handsome
young prince from the East, where the men are clothed in silk and
cashmere.Most assuredly I'll not miss this rare and unique opportunity
of exposing myself to a very serious and formidable temptation!not a European dress for me, though poor Dupont requests it!But the
name--the name of this dear prince!Once more, what a singular event is
this!If it should turn out to be that cousin from beyond the Ganges!During my childhood, I have heard so much in praise of his royal father!I shall be quite ravished to give his son the kind reception which he
merits!"And then she read on:

"If, besides this small sum, honored madame, you are so kind as to give
him, and also his companion, the means of reaching Paris, you will confer
a very great service upon this poor young prince, who is at present so
unfortunate."To conclude, I know enough of your delicacy to be aware that it would
perhaps be agreeable to you to afford this succor to the prince without
being known as his benefactress; in which case, I beg that you will be
pleased to command me; and you may rely upon my discretion.If, on the
contrary, you wish to address it directly to himself, his name is, as it
has been written for me by his countrymen, Prince Djalma, son of Radja
sing, King of Mundi."said Adrienne, quickly, and appearing to call up her
recollections, "Radja-sing!These are the very names
that my father so often repeated, while telling me that there was nothing
more chivalric or heroic in the world than the old king, our relation by
marriage; and the son has not derogated, it would seem, from that
character.Yes, Djalma, Radja-sing--once more, that is it--such names are
not so common," she added, smiling, "that one should either forget or
confound them with others.above all, he has never worn the horrid
European dress!Quick, quick let us improvise a pretty
fairy tale, of which the handsome and beloved prince shall be the hero!The poor bird of the golden and azure plumage has wandered into our
dismal climate; but he will find here, at least, something to remind him
of his native region of sunshine and perfumes!"Then, addressing one of
her women, she said: "Georgette, take paper and write, my child!"The
young girl went to the gilt, illuminated table, which contained materials
for writing; and, having seated herself, she said to her mistress: "I
await orders."Adrienne de Cardoville, whose charming countenance was radiant with the
gayety of happiness and joy, proceeded to dictate the following letter to
a meritorious old painter, who had long since taught her the arts of
drawing and designing; in which arts she excelled, as indeed she did in
all others:

"MY DEAR TITIAN, MY GOOD VERONESE, MY WORTHY RAPHAEL."You can render me a very great service,--and you will do it, I am sure,
with that perfect and obliging complaisance by which you are ever
distinguished."It is to go immediately and apply yourself to the skillful hand who
designed my last costumes of the fifteenth century.But the present
affair is to procure modern East Indian dresses for a young man--yes,
sir--for a young man,--and according to what I imagine of him, I fancy
that you can cause his measure to be taken from the Antinous, or rather,
from the Indian Bacchus; yes--that will be more likely."It is necessary that these vestments be at once of perfect propriety and
correctness, magnificently rich, and of the greatest elegance.You will
choose the most beautiful stuffs possible; and endeavor, above all
things, that they be, or resemble, tissues of Indian manufacture; and you
will add to them, for turbans and sashes, six splendid long cashmere
shawls, two of them white, two red, and two orange; as nothing suits
brown complexions better than those colors."This done (and I allow you at the utmost only two or three days), you
will depart post in my carriage for Cardoville Manor House, which you
know so well.The steward, the excellent Dupont, one of your old friends,
will there introduce you to a young Indian Prince, named Djalma; and you
will tell that most potent grave, and reverend signior, of another
quarter of the globe, that you have come on the part of an unknown
friend, who, taking upon himself the duty of a brother, sends him what is
necessary to preserve him from the odious fashions of Europe.You will
add, that his friend expects him with so much impatience that he conjures
him to come to Paris immediately.If he objects that he is suffering, you
will tell him that my carriage is an excellent bed-closet; and you will
cause the bedding, etc., which it contains, to be fitted up, till he
finds it quite commodious.Remember to make very humble excuses for the
unknown friend not sending to the prince either rich palanquins, or even,
modestly, a single elephant; for alas!palanquins are only to be seen at
the opera; and there are no elephants but those in the menagerie,--though
this must make us seem strangely barbarous in his eyes."As soon as you shall have decided on your departure, perform the journey
as rapidly as possible, and bring here, into my house, in the Rue de
Babylone (what predestination!that I should dwell in the street of
BABYLON,--a name which must at least accord with the ear of an
Oriental),--you will bring hither, I say, this dear prince, who is so
happy as to have been born in a country of flowers, diamonds, and sun!"Above all, you will have the kindness, my old and worthy friend, not to
be at all astonished at this new freak, and refrain from indulging in
extravagant conjectures.Seriously, the choice which I have made of you
in this affair,--of you, whom I esteem and most sincerely honor,--is
because it is sufficient to say to you that, at the bottom of all this,
there is something more than a seeming act of folly."In uttering these last words, the tone of Adrienne was as serious and
dignified as it had been previously comic and jocose.But she quickly
resumed, more gayly, dictating to Georgette.I am something like that commander of ancient
days, whose heroic nose and conquering chin you have so often made me
draw: I jest with the utmost freedom of spirit even in the moment of
battle: yes, for within an hour I shall give battle, a pitched battle--to
my dear pew-dwelling aunt.Fortunately, audacity and courage never failed
me, and I burn with impatience for the engagement with my austere
princess."A kiss, and a thousand heartfelt recollections to your excellent wife.If I speak of her here, who is so justly respected, you will please to
understand, it is to make you quite at ease as to the consequences of
this running away with, for my sake, a charming young prince,--for it is
proper to finish well where I should have begun, by avowing to you that
he is charming indeed!Then, addressing Georgette, said she, "Have you done writing, chit?""P.S.--I send you draft on sight on my banker for all expenses.You know I am quite a grand seigneur.I must use this masculine
expression, since your sex have exclusively appropriated to yourselves
(tyrants as you are) a term, so significant as it is of noble
generosity.""Now, Georgette," said Adrienne; "bring me an envelope, and the letter,
that I may sign it."Mademoiselle de Cardoville took the pen that
Georgette presented to her, signed the letter, and enclosed in it an
order upon her banker, which was expressed thus:

"Please pay M. Norval, on demand without grace, the sum of money he may
require for expenses incurred on my account."ADRIENNE DE CARDOVILLE."During all this scene, while Georgette wrote, Florine and Hebe had
continued to busy themselves with the duties of their mistress's
toilette, who had put off her morning gown, and was now in full dress, in
order to wait upon the princess, her aunt.From the sustained and
immovably fixed attention with which Florine had listened to Adrienne's
dictating to Georgette her letter to M. Norval, it might easily have been
seen that, as was her habit indeed, she endeavored to retain in her
memory even the slightest words of her mistress."Now, chit," said Adrienne to Hebe, "send this letter immediately to M.The same silver bell was again rung from without.Hebe moved towards the
door of the dressing-room, to go and inquire what it was, and also to
execute the order of her mistress as to the letter.But Florine
precipitated herself, so to speak, before her, and so as to prevent her
leaving the apartment; and said to Adrienne:

"Will it please my lady for me to send this letter?I have occasion to go
to the mansion.""Go, Florine, then," said Adrienne, "seeing that you wish it.Georgette,
seal the letter."At the end of a second or two, during which Georgette had sealed the
letter, Hebe returned."Madame," said she, re-entering, "the working-man who brought back Frisky
yesterday, entreats you to admit him for an instant.He is very pale, and
he appears quite sad.""Would that he may already have need of me!"Show the excellent young man into the little saloon.And, Florine, despatch this letter immediately."Miss de Cardoville, followed by Frisky, entered the
little reception-room, where Agricola awaited her.When Adrienne de Cardoville entered the saloon where Agricola expected
her, she was dressed with extremely elegant simplicity.A robe of deep
blue, perfectly fitted to her shape, embroidered in front with
interlacings of black silk, according to the then fashion, outlined her
nymph-like figure, and her rounded bosom.A French cambric collar,
fastened by a large Scotch pebble, set as a brooch, served her for a
necklace.Her magnificent golden hair formed a framework for her fair
countenance, with an incredible profusion of long and light spiral
tresses, which reached nearly to her waist.Agricola, in order to save explanations with his father, and to make him
believe that he had indeed gone to the workshop of M. Hardy, had been
obliged to array himself in his working dress; he had put on a new blouse
though, and the collar of his shirt, of stout linen, very white, fell
over upon a black cravat, negligently tied; his gray trousers allowed his
well polished boots to be seen; and he held between his muscular hands a
cap of fine woolen cloth, quite new.To sum up, his blue blouse,
embroidered with red, showing off the nervous chest of the young
blacksmith, and indicating his robust shoulders, falling down in graceful
folds, put not the least constraint upon his free and easy gait, and
became him much better than either frock-coat or dress-coat would have
done.While awaiting Miss de Cardoville, Agricola mechanically examined a
magnificent silver vase, admirably graven.A small tablet, of the same
metal, fitted into a cavity of its antique stand, bore the words--"Chased
by JEAN MARIE, working chaser, 1831."Adrienne had stepped so lightly upon the carpet of her saloon, only
separated from another apartment by the doors, that Agricola had not
perceived the young lady's entrance.He started, and turned quickly
round, upon hearing a silver and brilliant voice say to him-"That is a
beautiful vase, is it not, sir?""Very beautiful, madame," answered Agricola greatly embarrassed."You may see from it that I like what is equitable."added Miss de
Cardoville, pointing with her finger to the little silver tablet;--"an
artist puts his name upon his painting; an author publishes his on the
title-page of his book; and I contend that an artisan ought also to have
his name connected with his workmanship.""Oh, madame, so this name?""Is that of the poor chaser who executed this masterpiece, at the order
of a rich goldsmith.When the latter sold me the vase, he was amazed at
my eccentricity, he would have almost said at my injustice, when, after
having made him tell me the name of the author of this production, I
ordered his name to be inscribed upon it, instead of that of the
goldsmith, which had already been affixed to the stand.In the absence of
the rich profits, let the artisan enjoy the fame of his skill.It would have been impossible for Adrienne to commence the conversation
more graciously: so that the blacksmith, already beginning to feel a
little more at ease, answered:

"Being a mechanic myself, madame, I cannot but be doubly affected by such
a proof of your sense of equity and justice.""Since you are a mechanic, sir," resumed Adrienne, "I cannot but
felicitate myself on having so suitable a hearer.With a gesture full of affability, she pointed to an armchair of purple
silk embroidered with gold, sitting down herself upon a tete-a-tete of
the same materials.Seeing Agricola's hesitation, who again cast down his eyes with
embarrassment, Adrienne, to encourage him, showed him Frisky, and said to
him gayly: "This poor little animal, to which I am very much attached,
will always afford me a lively remembrance of your obliging complaisance,
sir.And this visit seems to me to be of happy augury; I know not what
good presentiment whispers to me, that perhaps I shall have the pleasure
of being useful to you in some affair.""Madame," said Agricola, resolutely, "my name is Baudoin: a blacksmith in
the employment of M. Hardy, at Pressy, near the city.Yesterday you
offered me your purse and I refused it: to-day, I have come to request of
you perhaps ten or twenty times the sum that you had generously proposed.I have said thus much all at once, madame, because it causes me the
greatest effort.The words blistered my lips, but now I shall be more at
ease.""I appreciate the delicacy of your scruples, sir," said Adrienne; "but if
you knew me, you would address me without fear."I do not know, madame," answered Agricola."No madame; and I come to you to request, not only the sum necessary to
me, but also information as to what that sum is.""Let us see, sir," said Adrienne, smiling, "explain this to me.In spite
of my good will, you feel that I cannot divine, all at once, what it is
that is required.""Madame, in two words, I can state the truth.I have a food old mother,
who in her youth, broke her health by excessive labor, to enable her to
bring me up; and not only me, but a poor abandoned child whom she had
picked up.It is my turn now to maintain her; and that I have the
happiness of doing.But in order to do so, I have only my labor.If I am
dragged from my employment, my mother will be without support.""Your mother cannot want for anything now, sir, since I interest myself
for her.""You will interest yourself for her, madame?""But you don't know her," exclaimed the blacksmith.said Agricola, with emotion, after a moment's silence.said Adrienne, looking at Agricola with a very surprised
air; for what he said to her was an enigma.The blacksmith, who blushed not for his friends, replied frankly."Madame, permit me to explain, to you.Mother Bunch is a poor and very
industrious young workwoman, with whom I have been brought up.She is
deformed, which is the reason why she is called Mother Bunch.But though,
on the one hand, she is sunk, as low as you are highly elevated on the
other, yet as regards the heart--as to delicacy--oh, lady, I am certain
that your heart is of equal worth with hers!That was at once her own
thought, after I had related to her in what manner, yesterday, you had
presented me with that beautiful flower.""I can assure you, sir," said Adrienne, sincerely touched, "that this
comparison flatters and honors me more than anything else that you could
say to me,--a heart that remains good and delicate, in spite of cruel
misfortunes, is so rare a treasure; while it is very easy to be good,
when we have youth and beauty, and to be delicate and generous, when we
are rich.I accept, then, your comparison; but on condition that you will
quickly put me in a situation to deserve it.In spite of the gracious cordiality of Miss de Cardoville, there was
always observable in her so much of that natural dignity which arises
from independence of character, so much elevation of soul and nobleness
of sentiment that Agricola, forgetting the ideal physical beauty of his
protectress, rather experienced for her the emotions of an affectionate
and kindly, though profound respect, which offered a singular and
striking contrast with the youth and gayety of the lovely being who
inspired him with this sentiment."If my mother alone, madame, were exposed to the rigor which I dread.I
should not be so greatly disquieted with the fear of a compulsory
suspension of my employment.Among poor people, the poor help one
another; and my mother is worshipped by all the inmates of our house, our
excellent neighbors, who would willingly succor her.But, they themselves
are far from being well off; and as they would incur privations by
assisting her, their little benefit would still be more painful to my
mother than the endurance even of misery by herself.And besides, it is
not only for my mother that my exertions are required, but for my father,
whom we have not seen for eighteen years, and who has just arrived from
Siberia, where he remained during all that time, from zealous devotion to
his former general, now Marshal Simon."said Adrienne, quickly, with an expression of much
surprise."Do you know the marshal, madame?""I do not personally know him, but he married a lady of our family."exclaimed the blacksmith, "then the two young ladies, his
daughters, whom my father has brought from Russia, are your relations!"asked Adrienne, more and more
astonished and interested."Yes, madame, two little angels of fifteen or sixteen, and so pretty, so
sweet; they are twins so very much alike, as to be mistaken for one
another.Their mother died in exile; and the little she possessed having
been confiscated, they have come hither with my father, from the depths
of Siberia, travelling very wretchedly; but he tried to make them forget
so many privations by the fervency of his devotion and his tenderness.you will not believe, madame, that, with the courage of
a lion, he has all the love and tenderness of a mother.""And where are the dear children, sir?"It is that which renders my position so very hard;
that which has given me courage to come to you; it is not but that my
labor would be sufficient for our little household, even thus augmented;
but that I am about to be arrested.""Pray, madame, have the goodness to read this letter, which has been sent
by some one to Mother Bunch."Agricola gave to Miss de Cardoville the anonymous letter which had been
received by the workwoman.After having read the letter, Adrienne said to the blacksmith, with
surprise, "It appears, sir, you are a poet!""I have neither the ambition nor the pretension to be one, madame.Only,
when I return to my mother after a day's toil, and often, even while
forging my iron, in order to divert and relax my attention, I amuse
myself with rhymes, sometimes composing an ode, sometimes a song.""And your song of the Freed Workman, which is mentioned in this letter,
is, therefore, very disaffected--very dangerous?""Oh, no, madame; quite the contrary.For myself, I have the good fortune
to be employed in the factory of M. Hardy, who renders the condition of
his workpeople as happy as that of their less fortunate comrades is the
reverse; and I had limited myself to attempt, in favor of the great mass
of the working classes, an equitable, sincere, warm, and earnest
claim--nothing more.But you are aware, perhaps, Madame, that in times of
conspiracy, and commotion, people are often incriminated and imprisoned
on very slight grounds.Should such a misfortune befall me, what will
become of my mother, my father, and the two orphans whom we are bound to
regard as part of our family until the return of their father, Marshal
Simon?It is on this account, madame, that, if I remain, I run the risk
of being arrested.I have come to you to request you to provide surety
for me; so that I should not be compelled to exchange the workshop for
the prison, in which case I can answer for it that the fruits of my labor
will suffice for all."said Adrienne, gayly, "this affair will arrange itself
quite easily.Poet, you shall draw your inspirations in
the midst of good fortune instead of adversity.But first of
all, bonds shall be given for you.""Oh, madame, you have saved us!""To continue," said Adrienne, "the physician of our family is intimately
connected with a very important minister (understand that, as you like,"
said she, smiling, "you will not deceive yourself much).The doctor
exercises very great influence over this great statesman; for he has
always had the happiness of recommending to him, on account of his
health; the sweets and repose of private life, to the very eve of the day
on which his portfolio was taken from him.Keep yourself, then, perfectly
at ease.If the surety be insufficient, we shall be able to devise some
other means."Madame," said Agricola, with great emotion, "I am indebted to you for
the repose, perhaps for the life of my mother.Believe that I shall ever
be grateful."It is proper that those
who have too much should have the right of coming to the aid of those who
have too little.Marshal Simon's daughters are members of my family, and
they will reside here with me, which will be more suitable.You will
apprise your worthy mother of this; and in the evening, besides going to
thank her for the hospitality which she has shown to my young relations,
I shall fetch them home."At this moment Georgette, throwing open the door which separated the room
from an adjacent apartment, hurriedly entered, with an affrighted look,
exclaiming:

"Oh, madame, something extraordinary is going on in the street.""I went to conduct my dressmaker to the little garden-gate," said
Georgette; "where I saw some ill-looking men, attentively examining the
walls and windows of the little out-building belonging to the pavilion,
as if they wished to spy out some one.""Madame," said Agricola, with chagrin, "I have not been deceived."I thought I was followed, from the moment when I left the Rue St.Merry:
and now it is beyond doubt.They must have seen me enter your house; and
are on the watch to arrest me.Well, now that your interest has been
acquired for my mother,--now that I have no farther uneasiness for
Marshal Simon's daughters,--rather than hazard your exposure to anything
the least unpleasant, I run to deliver myself up.""Beware of that sir," said Adrienne, quickly."Liberty is too precious to
be voluntarily sacrificed.Besides, Georgette may have been mistaken.But
in any case, I entreat you not to surrender yourself.Take my advice, and
escape being arrested.That, I think, will greatly facilitate my
measures; for I am of opinion that justice evinces a great desire to keep
possession of those upon whom she has once pounced.""Madame," said Hebe, now also entering with a terrified look, "a man
knocked at the little door, and inquired if a young man in a blue blouse
has not entered here.He added, that the person whom he seeks is named
Agricola Baudoin, and that he has something to tell him of great
importance.""That's my name," said Agricola; "but the important information is a
trick to draw me out.""Evidently," said Adrienne; "and therefore we must play off trick for
trick.added she, addressing herself to
Hebe."I answered, that I didn't know what he was talking about.""Quite right," said Adrienne: "and the man who put the question?""Without doubt to come back again, soon," said Agricola."That is very probable," said Adrienne, "and therefore, sir, it is
necessary for you to remain here some hours with resignation.I am
unfortunately obliged to go immediately to the Princess Saint-Dizier, my
aunt, for an important interview, which can no longer be delayed, and is
rendered more pressing still by what you have told me concerning the
daughters of Marshal Simon.Remain here, then, sir; since if you go out,
you will certainly be arrested.""Madame, pardon my refusal; but I must say once more that I ought not to
accept this generous offer.""They have tried to draw me out, in order to avoid penetrating with the
power of the law into your dwelling but if I go not out, they will come
in; and never will I expose you to anything so disagreeable.Now that I
am no longer uneasy about my mother, what signifies prison?""And the grief that your mother will feel, her uneasiness, and her
fears,--nothing?Think of your father; and that poor work-woman who loves
you as a brother, and whom I value as a sister;--say, sir, do you forget
them also?Believe me, it is better to spare those torments to your
family.Remain here; and before the evening I am certain, either by
giving surety, or some other means, of delivering you from these
annoyances.""But, madame, supposing that I do accept your generous offer, they will
come and find me here."There is in this pavilion, which was formerly the abode of a
nobleman's left-handed wife,--you see, sir," said Adrienne, smiling,
"that live in a very profane place--there is here a secret place of
concealment, so wonderfully well-contrived, that it can defy all
searches.You will be very well
accommodated.You will even be able to write some verses for me, if the
place inspire you.""Oh, sir, I will tell you.Admitting that your character and your
position do not entitle you to any interest;--admitting that I may not
owe a sacred debt to your father for the touching regards and cares he
has bestowed upon the daughters of Marshal Simon, my relations--do you
forget Frisky, sir?"asked Adrienne, laughing,--"Frisky, there, whom you
have restored to my fondles?Seriously, if I laugh," continued this
singular and extravagant creature, "it is because I know that you are
entirely out of danger, and that I feel an increase of happiness.Therefore, sir, write for me quickly your address, and your mother's, in
this pocket-book; follow Georgette; and spin me some pretty verses, if
you do not bore yourself too much in that prison to which you fly."While Georgette conducted the blacksmith to the hiding-place, Hebe
brought her mistress a small gray beaver hat with a gray feather; for
Adrienne had to cross the park to reach the house occupied by the
Princess Saint-Dizier.A quarter of an hour after this scene, Florine entered mysteriously the
apartment of Mrs.Grivois, the first woman of the princess."Here are the notes which I have taken this morning," said Florine,
putting a paper into the duenna's hand."Happily, I have a good memory.""At what time exactly did she return home this morning?""She did not go out, madame.We put her in the bath at nine o'clock.""But before nine o'clock she came home, after having passed the night out
of her house.Eight o'clock was the time at which she returned, however."Grivois with profound astonishment, and said-"I do
not understand you, madame."Madame did not come home this morning at eight o'clock?"I was ill yesterday, and did not come down till nine this morning, in
order to assist Georgette and Hebe help our young lady from the bath.I
know nothing of what passed previously, I swear to you, madame."You must ferret out what I allude to from your
companions.They don't distrust you, and will tell you all.""What has your mistress done this morning since you saw her?""Madame dictated a letter to Georgette for M. Norval, I requested
permission to send it off, as a pretext for going out, and for writing
down all I recollected.""Jerome had to go out, and I gave it him to put in the post-office."Grivois: "couldn't you bring it to me?""But, as madame dictated it aloud to Georgette, as is her custom, I knew
the contents of the letter; and I have written it in my notes."It is likely there was need to delay sending
off this letter; the princess will be very much displeased.""I thought I did right, madame.""I know that it is not good will that fails you.For these six months I
have been satisfied with you.But this time you have committed a very
great mistake."Grivois looked fixedly at her, and said in a sardonic tone:

"Very well, my dear, do not continue it.If you have scruples, you are
free."You well know that I am not free, madame," said Florine, reddening; and
with tears in her eyes she added: "I am dependent upon M. Rodin, who
placed me here.""In spite of one's self, one feels remorse.Madame is so good, and so
confiding."But you are not here to sing her
praises."The working-man who yesterday found and brought back Frisky, came early
this morning and requested permission to speak with my young lady.""And is this working-man still in her house?"He came in when I was going out with the letter.""You must contrive to learn what it was this workingman came about.""Has your mistress seemed preoccupied, uneasy, or afraid of the interview
which she is to have to-day with the princess?She conceals so little of
what she thinks, that you ought to know."said the tire-woman, muttering between her teeth,
without Florine being able to hear her: "'They laugh most who laugh
last.'In spite of her audacious and diabolical character, she would
tremble, and would pray for mercy, if she knew what awaits her this day."Then addressing Florine, she continued-"Return, and keep yourself, I
advise you, from those fine scruples, which will be quite enough to do
you a bad turn."I cannot forget that I belong not to myself, madame."Florine quitted the mansion and crossed the park to regain the summer
house, while Mrs Grivois went immediately to the Princess Saint-Dizier.To stakes and racks more were assigned,
    That climbing-vines support might find.Cried one, "Here, side by side, will stand
    The fairest flowers in the land.The thrifty bees for miles around
    Ere long will seek this plot of ground,
    And be surprised to find each morn
    New blossoms do each bed adorn.And in their own peculiar screed
    Will bless the hands that sowed the seed."And while that night they labored there,
    The cunning rogues had taken care
    With sticks and strings to nicely frame
    In line the letters of their name.That when came round the proper time
    For plants to leaf and vines to climb,
    The Brownies would remembered be,
    If people there had eyes to see.But morning broke (as break it will
    Though one's awake or sleeping still),
    And then the seeds on every side
    The hurried Brownies scattered wide.[Illustration]

[Illustration: BROWNIE]

    Along the road and through the lane
    They pattered on the ground like rain,
    Where Brownies, as away they flew,
    Both right and left full handfuls threw,
    And children often halted there
    To pick the blossoms, sweet and fair,
    That sprung like daisies from the mead
    Where fleeing Brownies flung the seed.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' CELEBRATION.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

        One night the Brownies reached a mound
        That rose above the country round.Said one, as seated on the place
        He glanced about with thoughtful face:
        "If almanacs have matters right
    The Fourth begins at twelve to-night,--
    A fitting time for us to fill
    Yon cannon there and shake the hill,
    And make the people all about
    Think war again has broken out.I know where powder may be found
              Both by the keg and by the pound;
              Men use it in a tunnel near
              For blasting purposes, I hear.To get supplies all hands will go,
    And when we come we'll not be slow
    To teach the folks the proper way
    To honor Independence Day."Then from the muzzle broke the flame,
                And echo answered to the sound
                That startled folk for miles around.'Twas lucky for the Brownies' Band
                They were not of the mortal brand,
                Or half the crew would have been hurled
                In pieces to another world.For when at last the cannon roared,
                So huge the charge had Brownies poured,
    The metal of the gun rebelled
    And threw all ways the load it held.The pieces clipped the daisy-heads
    And tore the tree-tops into shreds.But Brownies are not slow to spy
    A danger, as are you and I.[Illustration:

    'Tis the star spangled banner
    O long may it wave

                For they through strange and mystic art
                Observed it as it flew apart,
                And ducked and dodged and flattened out,
                To shun the fragments flung about.Some rogues were lifted from their feet
    And, turning somersaults complete,
    Like leaves went twirling through the air
    But only to receive a scare;
    And ere the smoke away had cleared
    In forest shade they disappeared.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES IN THE SWIMMING-SCHOOL.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    While Brownies passed along the street,
    Commenting on the summer's heat
    That wrapped the city day and night,
    A swimming-bath appeared in sight.Said one: "Of all the sights we've found,
    Since we commenced to ramble round,
    This seems to better suit the band
    Than anything, however grand.We'll rest awhile and find our way
    Inside the place without delay,
    And those who understand the art,
    Can knowledge to the rest impart;
        For every one should able be,
        To swim, in river, lake, or sea.We never know how soon we may,
        See some one sinking in dismay,--
        And then, to have the power to save
    A comrade from a watery grave,
    Will be a blessing sure to give
    Us joy the longest day we live."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The doors soon opened through the power
    That lay in Brownie hands that hour.When once within the fun began,
    As here and there they quickly ran;
    Some up the stairs made haste to go,
    Some into dressing-rooms below,
    In bathing-trunks to reappear
    And plunge into the water clear;
    Some from the spring-board leaping fair
    Would turn a somersault in air;
    More to the bottom like a stone,
    Would sink as soon as left alone,
    While others after trial brief
    Could float as buoyant as a leaf.[Illustration]

    Some all their time to others gave
    Assisting them to ride the wave,
    Explaining how to catch the trick,
    Both how to strike and how to kick;
    And still keep nose above the tide,
    That lungs with air might be supplied.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Thus diving in and climbing out,
    Or splashing round with laugh and shout,
    The happy band in water played
    As long as Night her scepter swayed.They heard the clocks in chapel towers
    Proclaim the swiftly passing hours.But when the sun looked from his bed
    To tint the eastern sky with red,
    In haste the frightened Brownies threw
    Their clothes about them and withdrew.[Illustration: TIME FLIES]




THE BROWNIES [Illustration] AND THE WHALE.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    As Brownies chanced at eve to stray
    Around a wide but shallow bay,
    Not far from shore, to their surprise,
    They saw a whale of monstrous size,
      That, favored by the wind and tide,
      Had ventured in from ocean wide,
      But waves receding by-and-by,
      Soon left him with a scant supply.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            At times, with flaps and lunges strong
            He worked his way some yards along,
            Till on a bar or sandy marge
            He grounded like a leaden barge."A chance like this for all the band,"
            Cried one, "but seldom comes to hand.I know the bottom of this bay
            Like those who made the coast survey.'Tis level as a threshing-floor
            And shallow now from shore to shore;
            That creature's back will be as dry
    As hay beneath a                  tropic sky,
    Till morning tide                 comes full and free
    And gives him aid                 to reach the sea."another cried;
    "Let all make haste               to gain his side
            Then clamber up as best we may,
            And ride him round till break of day."At once, the band in great delight
                         Went splashing through the water bright,
                         And soon to where he rolled about
                         They lightly swam, or waded out.Now climbing up, the Brownies tried
            To take position for the ride.Some lying down a hold maintained;
            More, losing place as soon as gained,
            Were forced a dozen times to scale
            The broad side of the stranded whale.Now half-afloat and half-aground
            The burdened monster circled round,
    Still groping clumsily about
    As if to find the channel out,
    And Brownies clustered close, in fear
    That darker moments might be near.And soon the dullest in the band
    Was sharp enough to understand
    The creature was no longer beached,
    But deeper water now had reached.For plunging left, or plunging right,
    Or plowing downward in his might,
    The fact was plain, as plain could be--
    The whale was working out to sea![Illustration]

    A creeping fear will seize the mind
    As one is leaving shores behind,
    And knows the bark whereon he sails
    Is hardly fit to weather gales.Soon Fancy, with a graphic sweep,
    Portrays the nightmares of the deep;
    While they can see, with living eye,
    The terrors of the air sweep by.[Illustration]

        For who would not a fierce bird dread,
        If it came flying at his head?And these were hungry, squawking things,
        With open beaks and flapping wings.They made the Brownies dodge and dip,
        Into the sea they feared to slip.The birds they viewed with chattering teeth,
    Yet dreaded more the foes beneath.The lobster, with his ready claw;
    The fish with sword, the fish with saw;
    The hermit-crab, in coral hall,
    Averse to every social call;
    The father-lasher, and the shrimp,
    The cuttle-fish, or ocean imp,
    All these increase the landsman's fright,
    As shores are fading out of sight.Such fear soon gained complete command
    Of every Brownie in the band.They looked behind, where fair and green
    The grassy banks and woods were seen.They looked ahead, where white and cold
    The foaming waves of ocean rolled,
    And then, with woful faces drew
    Comparisons between the two.[Illustration]

    Some blamed themselves for action rash
    Against all reason still to dash
    In danger's way, and never think
    Until they stood on ruin's brink.While others threw the blame on those
    Who did the risky trip propose.But meantime deep and deeper still
    The whale was settling down until
    His back looked like an island small
    That scarce gave standing-room to all.But, when their chance seemed slight indeed
    To sport again o'er dewy mead,
    The spouting whale, with movement strong,
    Ran crashing through some timbers long
    That lumbermen had strongly tied
    In cribs and rafts, an acre wide.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    'Twas then, in such a trying hour,
    The Brownies showed their nerve and power.The diving whale gave little time
    For them to choose a stick to climb,--
    But grips were strong; no hold was lost,
    However high the logs were tossed;
    By happy chance the boom remained
    That to the nearest shore was chained,
    And o'er that bridge the Brownies made
    A safe retreat to forest shade.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' KITES.[Illustration]

    The sun had hardly taken flight
    Unto the deepest caves of night;
    Or fowls secured a place of rest
    Where Reynard's paw could not molest,
    When Brownies gathered to pursue
    Their plans regarding pleasures new.Said one: "In spite of hand or string,
        Now hats fly round like crows in spring,
        Exposing heads to gusts of air,
    That ill the slightest draught can bear;
    While, high above the tallest tower,
    At morning, noon, and evening hour,
    The youngsters' kites with streaming tails
    Are riding out the strongest gales.The doves in steeples hide away
        Or keep their houses through the day,
        Mistaking every kite that flies
        For bird of prey of wondrous size."[Illustration]

        "You're not alone," another cried,
        "In taking note.I, too, have spied
        The boys of late, in street and court,
        Or on the roofs, at this fine sport;
        But yesternight I chanced to see
        A kite entangled in a tree.The string was nowhere to be found;
        The tail about a bough was wound.Some birds had torn the paper out,
        To line their nests, in trees about,
        But there beside the wreck I staid,
        Until I learned how kites are made.On me you safely may depend,
        To show the way to cut and bend.So let us now, while winds are high,
        Our hands at once to work apply;
        And from the hill that lifts its crown
        So far above the neighboring town,
        We'll send our kites aloft in crowds,
        To lose themselves among the clouds."A smile on every face was spread,
        At thought of fun like this, ahead;
        And quickly all the plans were laid,
        And work for every Brownie made.Some to the kitchens ran in haste,
        To manufacture pots of paste.Some ran for tacks or shingle-nails,
        And some for rags to make the tails,
        While more with loads of paper came,
        Or whittled sticks to make the frame.The strings, that others gathered, soon
        Seemed long enough to reach the moon.But where such quantities they found,
        'Tis not so easy to expound;--
        Perhaps some twine-shop, standing nigh,
        Was raided for the large supply;
        Perhaps some youthful angler whines
        About his missing fishing-lines.But let them find                   things where they will,
    The Brownies must                   be furnished still;
    And those who can't                 such losses stand,
    Will have to charge                 it to the Band.With busy fingers,                  well applied,
    They clipped and                    pasted, bent and tied;
    With paint and                      brush some ran about
    From kite to kite,                  to fit them out.On some they paint                  a visage fair,
    While others would                  affright a bear,
        Nor was it long (as one might guess
        Who knows what skill their hands possess)
        Before the kites, with string and tail,
        Were all prepared to ride the gale;
        And oh, the climax of their glee
        Was reached when kites were floating free!So quick they mounted through the air
        That tangling strings played mischief there,
    And threatened to remove from land
    Some valued members of the band.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The birds of night were horrified
    At finding kites on every side,
    And netted strings, that seemed to be
    Designed to limit action free.But Brownies stood or ran about,
    Now winding up, now letting out;
    Now giving kites more tail or wing,
    Now wishing for a longer string;
    Until they saw the hints of day
    Approaching through the morning gray.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' DANCING-SCHOOL.[Illustration]

    When flitting bats commenced to wheel
    Around the eaves to find their meal,
    And owls to hoot in forests wide,
    To call their owlets to their side,
    The Brownie Band, in full array,
    Through silent streets pursued their way.But as they neared a building high,
    Surprise was shown in every eye.They heard the strains of music sweet,
    And tripping of the dancers' feet;
    While o'er the tap of heel and toe,
    The twang of harp and scrape of bow,
    Arose the clear and ringing call
    Of those who had control of all.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The Brownies slackened their swift pace,
    Then gathered closely round the place,
            To study out some way to win
            A peep or two at those within.Said one: "In matters of this kind
            Opinions differ, you will find.And some might say, with sober thought,
            That children should not thus be taught
            To hop around on toe and heel
            So actively to fiddle's squeal,
                For fear 'twould turn their minds away
                From graver duties of the day."Another said: "The dancing art
                Doth ease to every move impart.It gives alike to city-bred
                And country-born a graceful tread,
            And helps them bear themselves along
            Without offense in greatest throng.The nimble step, the springing knee,
    And balanced body all agree.The feet, my friends, may glide with grace
    As well as trudge from place to place.And in the parlor or without
    They best can stand or walk about
    Who found in early life a chance
    To mingle in the sprightly dance."[Illustration]

    The Brownies need no ladders long,
    No hoists, nor elevators strong,
    To lift them to an upper flight,
    A window-sill, or transom light.The weather-vane upon the spire,
    That overlooks the town entire,
    Is not too high above the base
    If fancy leads them to the place.'Tis said the very fleecy clouds
    They can bestride in eager crowds,
    Around the world their way to find,
    And leave the lagging winds behind.Said one: "We've scaled the dizzy heights
    Of mountain-peaks on other nights,
    And crossed the stream from shore to shore
    Where but the string-piece stretched before;
    And cunning Brownies, never fear,
    Will find some way to enter here."[Illustration]

    When once the Brownies' plans were laid,
    No formal, tiresome speech was made.In mystic ways, to Brownies known,
    They clambered up the walls of stone.They clung to this and that, like briers,
    They climbed the smooth electric wires;
    Some members lending ready aid
    To those who weaker nerves displayed.And in five minutes at the most,
    By vine, by bracket, and by post,
    By every scroll, and carving bold,
    That toes could touch or fingers hold
    They made their way, and gained a chance
    To view, unnoticed, every dance.Said one: "How pleasant is the sight
    To see those children young and bright
    While skipping blithely to and fro,
    Now joined in pairs, now in a row,
    Or formed in circles, hand in hand,
    And lightly moving at command--

[Illustration]

        Like butterflies through balmy air
        When summer spreads attractions fair,
    And blends with every whispering breeze
    The drowsy hum of working bees."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Another said: "When this is o'er
    The Brownie Band will take the floor.We'll bide our time and not be slow
            To take possession when they go.Then up and down the spacious hall
              We'll imitate the steps of all.We'll show that not in Frenchmen's bones
              Lies all the grace that nature owns;
              That others at the waltz can shine
              As well as Germans from the Rhine;
            That we some capers can enjoy
            As well as natives of Savoy."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            While thus they talked, the moments flew,
            And soon the master's task was through.When children's cloaks were wrapped around,
    And heavier shoes their feet had found
    They hastened home; but while they slept
    The Brownies in that building crept
    To take their turn at lively reel,
            At graceful glide, or dizzy wheel,
            Till all the dances people know,
              From Cuba's palms to Russia's snow
              Were tried, and soon in every case
              Were mastered with surprising grace.Imagine how they skipped about,
              And how they danced, with laugh and shout![Illustration]

[Illustration]

    No sooner had the Brownies run
    Into the hall than 'twas begun.Some round the harp, with cunning stroke,
    The music in the strings awoke.The violins to others fell,
    Who scraped, and sawed, and fingered well,
    Until the sweet and stirring air
    Would rouse the feet of dullest there.Like people in the spring of life,
    Of joys and countless blessings rife,
    Who yield themselves to Pleasure's hand--
    So danced that night the Brownie Band.First one would take his place to show
    The special step for heel or toe,
    Just how to edge about with care,
    And help around the partner fair,
    Nor plant his feet upon a dress--
    To cause confusion and distress.Then more would play the master's part,
    And give some lessons in the art:

[Illustration]

        Would show the rest some figures new
        From Turkey, China, or Peru.Now smoothly glide, as if on wings,
    Then bob around, as if on springs,
    Until the sprightly steps would call
    Loud acclamations from them all.They danced in twos with skip and bound,
    They danced in circles, round and round;
    They danced in lines that coiled about
    As runs the serpent in and out,
    Some moving slow, some standing still--
    More cutting capers with a will.At length, by joining hand in hand,
    The set included all the band.A happier crowd was never seen
    On ball-room floor or village green.By turns they danced, by turns would go
    And try their skill at string and bow--
    They almost sawed the fiddle through,
    So fast the bow across it flew.And louder still the harp would ring,
    As nimbler fingers plucked the string.Alike they seemed a skillful band
    Upon the floor or music-stand.The night wore on, from hour to hour,
    And still they danced with vim and power;
    For supple-kneed and light of toe
    The Brownies are, as well you know,
    And such a thing as tiring out
    Gives them but small concern, no doubt.As long as darkness hung her pall
    In heavy folds around the hall,
    The Brownies stayed to dance and play,
    Until the very break of day.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    To dance the figures o'er and o'er,
    They lingered on the polished floor;
    No sooner was one party done
    Than others the position won.They chose their partners for the set,
    And bowed, and scraped, and smiling, met.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    As night advanced, and morning gray
    Nigh and still nigher cast its ray,
    The lively Brownies faster flew,
    Across and back, around and through;
    Now down the center, up the side,
    Then back to place with graceful glide--
                  Until it seemed that even day
                  Would hardly drive the band away.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                  At length some, more upon their guard
                  Against surprises, labored hard
    To urge their comrades from the place
    Before the sun would show his face.They pulled and hauled with all their might
    At those half crazy with delight,
                  Who still would struggle for a chance
                  To have, at least, another dance--
                  Some figure that was quite forgot,
                          Although "the finest of the lot."Another wished to linger still--
                          In spite of warning words--until
                          Each member present on the floor
                          Had been his partner twice or more.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                Meantime, outside, the tell-tale dyes
                Of morn began to paint the skies,
                And, one by one, the stars of night
                Grew pale before the morning's light.Alone, bright Venus, in the west,
                Upheld her torch and warned the rest;
                While from the hedge the piping note
                Of waking birds began to float;
    And crows upon the wooded hills
    Commenced to stir and whet their bills,
    When Brownies scampered from the place,
    And undertook the homeward race.Nor made a halt in street or square,
    Or verdant park, however fair;
    But farther from the sight of man
    And light of day, they quickly ran.They traveled at their highest speed,
    And swiftly must they go, indeed;
    For, like the spokes of some great wheel,
    The rays of light began to steal
    Still higher up the eastern sky,
    And showed the sun was rolling nigh.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' CANDY-PULL.[Illustration]

    One evening, while the Brownies sat
    Enjoying free and friendly chat,
    Some on the trees, some on the ground,
    And others perched on fences round--
    One Brownie, rising in his place,
    Addressed the band with beaming face.The listeners gathered with delight
    Around the member, bold and bright,
    To hear him tell of scenes he'd spied
    While roaming through the country wide."Last eve," said he, "to shun the blast,
    Behind a cottage fence I passed.While there, I heard a merry rout,
    And as the yard was dark without,
    I crawled along through weeds and grass,
    Through melon-vines and broken glass,
    Until I might, unnoticed, win
    A glimpse of all the sport within.At length, below the window-pane,
                    To reach the sill I stretched in vain;
                    But, thanks to my inquiring mind
                    And sundry bricks, I chanced to find
    The facts I can relate in full
    About that lively candy-pull.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    "An hour or more, I well believe,
    I stood, their actions to perceive,
    With elbows resting on the sill,
    And nose against the window still.I watched them closely at their fun,
    And learned how everything was done.The younger members took the lead,
    And carried on the work with speed.With nimble feet they ran about
    From place to place, with laugh and shout;
    But older heads looked on the while,
    And cheered the youngsters with a smile,
    And gave advice in manner kind
    To guide the inexperienced mind.They placed the sugar in a pot,
    And stirred it round till boiling hot;
    Then rolled and worked it in their hands,
    And stretched it out in shining bands,
    Until it reached across the floor,
    From mantel-piece to kitchen door."These eyes of mine for many a night
    Have not beheld a finer sight.To pull the candy was the part
    Of some who seemed to know the art.The moon had slipped behind the hill,
    And hoarse had grown the whip-poor-will;
    But still, with nose against the pane,
    I kept my place through wind and rain.There, perched upon the shaky pile,
    With bated breath I gazed the while.I watched them with the sharpest sight
    That I might tell the tale aright;
    For all the active youngsters there
    Appeared to have of work their share.Some put fresh sugar in the pot,
    Some kept the fire blazing hot,
    And worked away as best they could
    To keep the stove well filled with wood.Indeed, ourselves, with all our skill,
    At moving here and there at will,
    Would have to 'lively' be and 'tear
    Around' to beat those children there!Some cut it up, more passed it round,
    While others ate it by the pound!"[Illustration]

    At this, a murmur of surprise
    On every side began to rise;
    Then smiles o'er every visage flitted,
    As wide as cheeks and ears permitted,
    That told what train of thought had sped
    At once through every Brownie's head--
    A thought of pleasure near at hand
    That well would suit the cunning band.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            The Brownies act without delay
            When new ideas cross their way,
            And soon one raised a finger small
            And close attention gained from all.They crowded near with anxious glance
            To learn what scheme he could advance--
    What methods mention or employ
    To bring about the promised joy.Said he: "A vacant house is near.The owner leaves it every year
    For several months, and pleasure seeks
    On ocean waves or mountain peaks.The range is there against the wall,
            The pots, the pans, the spoons, and all,
            While cans of syrup may be found
            In every grocer's store around.The Brownie must be dull and tame,
            And scarce deserves to bear the name,
            Who will not join with heart and hand
            To carry out a scheme so grand."[Illustration]

    Another cried: "When to his bed
    The sun to-morrow stoops his head,
    Again we'll muster in full force
    And to that building turn our course."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            Next eve they gained the street at last
            That through the silent city passed;
            And soon they paused, their eyes they raised
            And on the vacant mansion gazed.In vain the miser hides his store,
    In vain the merchant bars his door,
    In vain the locksmith changes keys--
    The Brownies enter where they please.Through iron doors, through gates of brass,
    And walls of stone they safely pass,
    And smile to think how soon they can
    Upset the studied schemes of man.Within that house, without delay,
    Behind the guide they worked their way,
    More happy far and full of glee
    Than was the owner, out at sea.The whale, the shark, or fish that flies
    Had less attraction for his eyes
    Than had the shining candy-balls
    For Brownies, swarming through his halls.Soon coal was from the cellar brought
    And kindling wood came, quick as thought;
    Then pots and pans came rattling in
    And syrup sweet, in cans of tin.Just where the syrup had been found
    It matters not.The cunning band was soon possessed
    Of full supplies and of the best;
    Next tablespoons of silver fine
    In every hand appeared to shine,
    And ladles long, of costly ware,
    That had been laid away with care.No sooner was the syrup hot
    Than some around the kettle got,
    And dabbed away in eager haste
    To be the first to get a taste.Then some were scalded when the spoon
    Let fall its contents all too soon,
            And gave the tongue too warm a mess
            To carry without some distress.Then steps were into service brought
            That dancing-masters never taught,
            And smothered cries and swinging hand
            Would wake the wonder of the band.And when the candy boiled until
            It could be pulled and hauled at will,
    Take every shape or twist, and seem
    As free as fancy in a dream,
    The busy, happy-hearted crew
    Enjoyed the moments as they flew.The Brownies in the building stayed
    And candy ate as fast as made.But when at length the brightening sky
    Gave warning they must homeward fly,
    They quickly sought the open air
    And had but little time to spare.The shortest way, as often found,
    Was o'er the roughest piece of ground,
    Where rocks as large as houses lay
    All scattered round in wild array.Some covered o'er with clinging vines,
    Some bearing up gigantic pines,
    Or spreading oaks, that rooted fast,
    For centuries had stood the blast.But over all the rugged ground
    The Brownies passed with lightsome bound,
    Now jumping clear from block to block,
    Now sliding down the shelving rock,
    Or cheering on the lagging kind
    Who here and there would fall behind.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES AND THE LOCOMOTIVE.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                One night the Brownies found their way
                To where some tracks and switches lay,
                And buildings stood, such as are found
    In every town on railroad ground.They moved about from place to place,
    With prying eyes and cautious pace
    They peeped in shops and gained a view,
    Where cars were standing bright and new;
    While others, that had service known,
    And in some crash were overthrown,
    On jack-screws, blocks, and such affairs,
    Were undergoing full repairs.The table that turns end for end
            Its heavy load, without a bend,
            Was next inspected through and through
            And tested by the wondering crew.They scanned the signal-lights with care
            That told the state of switches there,--
            Showed whether tracks kept straight ahead,
            Or simply to some siding led.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                Then round a locomotive strong
                They gathered in an earnest throng,
                Commenting on the style it showed,
                Its strength and speed upon the road.Said one: "That 'pilot' placed before
                Will toss a cow a block or more;
            You'd hardly find a bone intact
            When such a thing her frame has racked--
            Above the fence, and, if you please,
            Above the smoke-stack and the trees
            Will go the horns and heels in air,
            When hoisted by that same affair.""Sometimes it saves," another cried,
            "And throws an object far aside
            That would to powder have been ground,
            If rushing wheels a chance had found.I saw a goat tossed from the track
            And landed on a farmer's stack,
            And though surprised at fate so strange,
            He seemed delighted at the change;
            And lived content, on best of fare,
            Until the farmer found him there."Another said: "We'll have some fun
    And down the road this engine run.The steam is up, as gauges show;
    She's puffing, ready now to go;
    The fireman and the engineer
    Are at their supper, in the rear
    Of yonder shed.I took a peep,
    And found the watchman fast asleep.So now's our time, if we but haste,
    The joys of railway life to taste.I know the engine-driver's art,
    Just how to stop, reverse, and start;
    I've watched them when they little knew
    From every move I knowledge drew;
    We'll not be seen till under way,
    And then, my friends, here let me say,
    The man or beast will something lack
    Who strives to stop us on the track."Then some upon the engine stepped,
    And some upon the pilot crept,
    And more upon the tender found
    A place to sit and look around.And soon away the engine rolled
    At speed 'twas fearful to behold;
    It seemed they ran, where tracks were straight,
    At least at mile-a-minute rate;
    And even where the curves were short
    The engine turned them with a snort
    That made the Brownies' hearts the while
    Rise in their throats, for half a mile.But travelers many dangers run
    On safest roads beneath the sun.They ran through yards, where dogs came out
    To choke with dust that whirled about,
    And so could neither growl nor bark
    Till they had vanished in the dark;
    Some pigs that wandered late at night,
    And neither turned to left nor right,
        But on the crossing held debate
        Who first should squeeze beneath the gate,
        Were helped above the fence to rise
        Ere they had time to squeal surprise,
        And never after cared to stray
        Along the track by night or day.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

        But when a town was just in sight,
        And speed was at its greatest height,--
        Alas!that such a thing should be,--
        An open switch the Brownies see.Then some thought best at once to go
                        Into the weeds and ditch below;
                        But many on the engine stayed
                        And held their grip, though much dismayed.And waited for the shock to fall
                        That would decide the fate of all.In vain reversing tricks were tried,
                        And brakes to every wheel applied;
                        The locomotive forward flew,
                        In spite of all that skill could do.But just as they approached the place
                Where trouble met them face to face,
    Through some arrangement, as it seemed,
    Of which the Brownies never dreamed,
    The automatic switch was closed,
    A safety signal-light exposed,
    And they were free to roll ahead,
    And wait for those who'd leaped in dread;
    Although the end seemed near at hand
    Of every Brownie in the band,
    And darkest heads through horrid fright
    Were in a moment changed to white,
    The injuries indeed were small.A few had suffered from their fall,
    And some were sprained about the toes,
    While more were scraped upon the nose;
    But all were able to succeed
    In climbing to a place with speed,
    And there they stayed until once more
    They passed the heavy round-house door.Then jumping down on every side
    The Brownies scampered off to hide;
    And as they crossed the trestle high
    The sun was creeping up the sky,
    And urged them onward in their race
    To find some safe abiding place.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' FANCY BALL.[Illustration]

    It was the season of the year
    When people, dressed in fancy gear,
    From every quarter hurried down
    And filled the largest halls in town;
    And there to flute and fiddle sweet
    Went through their sets with lively feet.The Brownies were not slow to note
    That fun indeed was now afloat;
    And ere the season passed away,
    Of longest night and shortest day,
    They looked about to find a hall
    Where they could hold their fancy ball.Said one: "A room can soon be found
    Where all the band can troop around;
    But want of costumes, much I fear,
    Will bar our pleasure all the year."My eyes have not been shut of late,--
    Don't show a weak and hopeless mind
    Because your knowledge is confined,--

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    For I'm prepared to take the band
    To costumes, ready to the hand,
    Of every pattern, new or old:
    The kingly robes, with chains of gold,
    The cloak and plume of belted knight,
    The pilgrim's hat and stockings white,
    The dresses for the ladies fair,
    The gems and artificial hair,
    The soldier-suits in blue and red,
    The turban for the Tartar's head,
    All can be found where I will lead,
    If friends are willing to proceed."[Illustration]

    Those knowing best the Brownie way
    Will know there was no long delay,
    Ere to the town he made a break
    With all the Brownies in his wake.It mattered not that roads were long,
    That hills were high or winds were strong;
    Soon robes were found on peg and shelf,
    And each one chose to suit himself.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    The costumes, though a world too wide,
    And long enough a pair to hide,
    Were gathered in with skill and care,
    That showed the tailor's art was there.Then out they started for the hall,
    In fancy trappings one and all;
    Some clad like monks in sable gowns;
    And some like kings; and more like clowns;
    And Highlanders, with naked knees;
    And Turks, with turbans like a cheese;
    While many members in the line
    Were dressed like ladies fair and fine,
    And swept along the polished floor
    A train that reached a yard or more.[Illustration]

    By happy chance some laid their hand
    Upon the outfit of a band;
    The horns and trumpets took the lead,
    Supported well by string and reed;
    And violins, that would have made
    A mansion for the rogues that played,
    With flute and clarionet combined
    In music of the gayest kind.In dances wild and strange to see
    They passed the hours in greatest glee;
    Familiar figures all were lost
    In flowing robes that round them tossed;
    And well-known faces hid behind
    Queer masks that quite confused the mind.The queen and clown, a loving pair,
    Enjoyed a light fandango there;
    While solemn monks of gentle heart,
    In jig and scalp-dance took their part.The grand salute, with courteous words,
                The bobbing up and down, like birds,
                The lively skip, the stately glide,
                The double turn, and twist aside
                Were introduced in proper place
                And carried through with ease and grace.So great the pleasure proved to all,
    Too long they tarried in the hall,
    And morning caught them on the fly,
    Ere they could put the garments by!Then dodging out in great dismay,
            By walls and stumps they made their way;
            And not until the evening's shade
            Were costumes in their places laid.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES AND THE TUGBOAT.[Illustration]

    While Brownies strayed along a pier
    To view the shipping lying near,
    A tugboat drew their gaze at last;
    'Twas at a neighboring wharf made fast.Cried one: "See what in black and red
    Below the pilot-house is spread!In honor of the Brownie Band,
    It bears our name in letters grand.Through all the day she's on the go;
    Now with a laden scow in tow,
    And next with barges two or three,
    Then taking out a ship to sea,
    Or through the Narrows steaming round
    In search of vessels homeward bound;
    She's stanch and true from stack to keel,
    And we should highly honored feel."Another said: "An hour ago,
    The men went up to see a show,
    And left the tugboat lying here.The steam is up, our course is clear,
    We'll crowd on board without delay
    And run her up and down the bay.We have indeed a special claim,
    Because she bears the 'Brownie' name.Before the dawn creeps through the east
    We'll know about her speed at least,
    And prove how such a craft behaves
    When cutting through the roughest waves.Behind the wheel I'll take my stand
    And steer her round with skillful hand,
    Now down the river, now around
    The bay, or up the broader sound;
    Throughout the trip I'll keep her clear
    Of all that might awaken fear.When hard-a-port the helm I bring,
    Or starboard make a sudden swing,
    The Band can rest as free from dread
    As if they slept on mossy bed.I something know about the seas,
    I've boxed a compass, if you please,
    And so can steer her east or west,
    Or north or south, as suits me best.Without the aid of twinkling stars
    Or light-house lamps, I'll cross the bars.I know when north winds nip the nose,
    Or sou'-sou'-west the 'pig-wind' blows,
    As hardy sailors call the gale
    That from that quarter strikes the sail."A third replied: "No doubt you're smart
    And understand the pilot's art,
    But more than one a hand should take,
    For all our lives will be at stake.In spite of eyes and ears and hands,
    And all the skill a crew commands,
    How oft collisions crush the keel
    And give the fish a sumptuous meal!Too many rocks around the bay
    Stick up their heads to bar the way.Too many vessels, long and wide,
    At anchor in the channel ride
    For us to show ourselves unwise
    And trust to but one pair of eyes."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Ere long the tugboat swinging clear
    Turned bow to stream and left the pier,
    While many Brownies, young and old,
    From upper deck to lower hold
    Were crowding round in happy vein
    Still striving better views to gain.Some watched the waves around them roll;
    Some stayed below to shovel coal,
    From hand to hand, with pitches strong,
    They passed the rattling loads along.Some at the engine took a place,
    More to the pilot-house would race
    To keep a sharp lookout ahead,
    Or man the wheel as fancy led.But accidents we oft record,
    However well we watch and ward,
    And vessels often go to wreck
    With careful captains on the deck;
    They had mishaps that night, for still,
    In spite of all their care and skill,
    While running straight or turning round
    In river, bay, or broader sound,
    At times they ran upon a rock,
    And startled by the sudden shock
    Some timid Brownies, turning pale,
    Would spring at once across the rail;
    And then, repenting, find all hope
    Of life depended on a rope,
    That willing hands were quick to throw
    And hoist them from the waves below.Sometimes too near a ship they ran
    For peace of mind; again, their plan
    Would come to naught through lengthy tow
    Of barges passing to and fro.The painted buoys around the bay
    At times occasioned some dismay--
    They took them for torpedoes dread
    That might the boat in fragments spread,
    Awake the city's slumbering crowds,
    And hoist the band among the clouds.But thus, till hints of dawn appeared
    Now here, now there, the boat was steered
    With many joys and many fears,
    That some will bear in mind for years;
    But at her pier once more she lay
    When night gave place to creeping day.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' TALLY-HO.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    As shades of evening closed around,
        The Brownies, from some wooded ground,
        Looked out to view with staring eye
        A Tally-Ho, then passing by.Around the park they saw it roll,
    Now sweeping round a wooded knoll,
    Now rumbling o'er an arching bridge,
    Now hid behind a rocky ridge,
    Now wheeling out again in view
    To whirl along some avenue.They hardly could restrain a shout
    When they observed the grand turnout.The long, brass horn, that trilled so loud,
    The prancing horses, and the crowd
                    Of people perched so high in air
                    Pleased every wondering Brownie there.Said one: "A rig like this we see
    Would suit the Brownies to a T!And I'm the one, here let me say,
    To put such pleasures in our way:
    I know the very place to go
    To-night to find a Tally-Ho.It never yet has borne a load
                    Of happy hearts along the road;
                    But, bright and new in every part
                    'Tis ready for an early start.The horses in the stable stand
                    With harness ready for the hand;
                    If all agree, we'll take a ride
                    For miles across the country wide."Another said: "The plan is fine;
                    You well deserve to head the line;
                    But, on the road, the reins I'll draw;
    I know the way to 'gee' and 'haw,'
    And how to turn a corner round,
    And still keep wheels upon the ground."Another answered: "No, my friend,
    We'll not on one alone depend;
    But three or four the reins will hold,
                    That horses may be well controlled.The curves are short, the hills are steep,
                    The horses fast, and ditches deep,
                    And at some places half the band
                    May have to take the lines in hand."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    That night, according to their plan,
    The Brownies to the stable ran;
    Through swamps they cut to reach the place,
    And cleared the fences in their race
      As lightly as the swallow flies
        To catch its morning meal supplies.Though, in the race, some clothes were soiled,
            And stylish shoes completely spoiled,
    Across the roughest hill or rock
    They scampered like a frightened flock,
    Now o'er inclosures knee and knee,
    With equal speed they clambered free
    And soon with faces all aglow
    They crowded round the Tally-Ho;
    But little time they stood to stare
    Or smile upon the strange affair.As many hands make labor light,
    And active fingers win the fight,
    Each busy Brownie played his part,
    And soon 't was ready for the start.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    But ere they took their seats to ride
    By more than one the horns were tried,
    Each striving with tremendous strain
    The most enlivening sound to gain,
    And prove he had a special right
    To blow the horn throughout the night.[Illustration]

    Though some were crowded in a seat,
    And some were forced to keep their feet
    Or sit upon another's lap,
    And some were hanging to a strap,
    With merry laugh and ringing shout,
    And tooting horns, they drove about.A dozen miles, perhaps, or more,
    The lively band had traveled o'er,
    Commenting on their happy lot
    And keeping horses on the trot,
    When, as they passed a stunted oak
    A wheel was caught, the axle broke![Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then some went out with sudden pitch,
    And some were tumbled in the ditch,
    And one jumped off to save his neck,
    While others still hung to the wreck.Confusion reigned, for coats were rent,
    And hats were crushed, and horns were bent,
    And what began with fun and clatter
    Had turned to quite a serious matter.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                        Some blamed the drivers, others thought
                        The tooting horns the trouble brought.More said, that they small wisdom showed,
                        Who left the root so near the road.But while they talked about their plight
                        Upon them burst the morning light
                        With all the grandeur and the sheen
                          That June could lavish on the scene.So hitching horses where they could,
                                  The Brownies scampered for the wood.And lucky were the Brownies spry:
                                  A dark and deep ravine was nigh
                                  That seemed to swallow them alive
    So quick were they to jump and dive,
    To safely hide from blazing day
    That fast had driven night away,
    And forced them to leave all repairs
    To other heads and hands than theirs.THE BROWNIES ON

[Illustration]

THE RACE-TRACK.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    While Brownies moved around one night
                    A seaside race-track came in sight."'T is here," said one, "the finest breed
                    Of horses often show their speed;
                    Here, neck and neck, and nose and nose,
                    Beneath the jockeys' urging blows,
                    They sweep around the level mile
                    The people shouting all the while;
    And climbing up or crowding through
    To gain a better point of view,
    So they can see beyond a doubt
    How favorites are holding out."Another said: "I know the place
    Where horses wait to-morrow's race;
    We'll strap the saddles on their back,
    And lead them out upon the track.Then some will act the jockey's part,
    And some, as judges, watch the start,
    And drop the crimson flag to show
    The start is fair and all must go."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Ere long, the Brownies turned to haul
    Each wondering race-horse from his stall.They bridled them without delay,
        And saddles strapped in proper way.Some restless horses rearing there
        Would toss their holders high in air,
        And test the courage and the art
        Of those who took an active part.Said one: "I've lurked in yonder wood,
          And watched the races when I could.I know how all is done with care
              When thus for racing they prepare;
                How every buckle must be tight,
                And every strap and stirrup right,
    Or jockeys would be on the ground
    Before they circled half way round."When all was ready for the show
    Each Brownie rogue was nowise slow
    At climbing up to take a place
    And be a jockey in the race.Full half a dozen Brownies tried
    Upon one saddle now to ride;
    But some were into service pressed
    As judges to control the rest--
    To see that rules were kept complete,
    And then decide who won the heat.A dozen times they tried to start;
    Some shot ahead like jockeys smart,
    And were prepared to take the lead
    Around the track at flying speed.But others were so far behind,
    On horses of unruly mind,
    The judges from the stand declare
    The start was anything but fair.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

        So back they'd jog at his command,
        In better shape to pass the stand.Indeed it was no simple trick
        To ride those horses, shy and quick,
        And only for the mystic art
        That is the Brownies' special part,
    A dozen backs, at least, had found
    A resting-place upon the ground.The rules of racing were not quite
    Observed in full upon that night.Around and round the track they flew,
    In spite of all the judge could do.The race, he tried to let them know,
    Had been decided long ago.But still the horses kept the track,
    With Brownies clinging to each back.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            Some racers of the jumping kind
            At times disturbed the riders' mind
            When from the track they sudden wheeled,
            And over fences took the field,
            As if they hoped in some such mode
            To rid themselves of half their load.But horses, howsoever smart,
        Are not a match for Brownie art,
    For still the riders stuck through all,
    In spite of fence, or ditch, or wall.Some clung to saddle, some to mane,
    While others tugged at bridle rein.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    So all the steeds found it would pay
    To let the Brownies have their way,
    Until a glimpse of rising sun
    Soon made them leave the place and run.[Illustration]

THE BROWNIES' BIRTHDAY DINNER.[Illustration]

    When people through the county planned
    To give their public dinners grand,
    The Brownies met at day's decline
    To have a birthday banquet fine."The proper things," a speaker cried,
    "Await us here on every side;
    We simply have to reach and take
    And choose a place to boil and bake.With meal and flour at our feet,
    And wells of water pure and sweet,
    That Brownie must be dull indeed
    Who lacks the gumption to proceed.We'll peel the pumpkins, ripened well,
    And scoop them hollow, like a shell,
    Then slice them up the proper size
    To make at length those famous pies,
    For which the people, small and great,
    Are ever quick to reach a plate."[Illustration]

    This pleased them all; so none were slow
    In finding work at which to go.A stove that chance threw in their way
    Was put in shape without delay.Though doors were cracked, and legs were rare,
                    The spacious oven still was there,
                    Where pies and cakes and puddings wide
                    Might bake together side by side.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

              The level top, though incomplete,
              Gave pots and pans a welcome seat,
              Where stews could steam and dumplings found
              A fitting place to roll around.Some lengths of pipe were raised on high
    That made the soot and cinders fly,
    And caused a draught throughout the wreck
    That door or damper failed to check.The rogues who undertook the part,
              That tries the cook's delightful art,
              Had smarting hands and faces red
              Before the table-cloth was spread;
                      But what cared they at such an hour
                      For singeing flame or scalding shower?Such ills are always reckoned slight
                      When great successes are in sight.There cakes and tarts and cookies fine,
                      Of both the "leaf" and "notched" design,
                      Were ranged in rows around the pan
                    That into heated ovens ran;
                    Where, in what seemed a minute's space,
                    Another batch would take their place;
                    While birds, that had secured repose
                    Above the reach of Reynard's nose,
                    Without the aid of wings came down
                    To be at midnight roasted brown.They found some boards and benches laid
                    Aside by workmen at their trade,
                    And these upon the green were placed
                    By willing hands with proper haste.Said one, who board and bench combined:
                    "All art is not to cooks confined,
                    And some expertness we can show
                    As well as those who mix the dough."And all was as the speaker said;
                In fact, they were some points ahead;
              For when the cooks their triumphs showed,
            The table waited for its load.The knives and forks and dishes white
        By secret methods came to light.Much space would be required to tell
    Just how the table looked so well;
    But kitchen cupboards, three or four,
    Must there have yielded up their store;
    For all the guests on every side
    With full equipments were supplied.When people find a carver hacked,
    A saucer chipped, or platter cracked,
    They should be somewhat slow to claim
    That servants are the ones to blame;
        For Brownies may have used the ware
      And failed to show the proper care.[Illustration]

     A few, as waiters, passed about
    New dishes when the old gave out,
     And saw the plates, as soon as bare,
      Were heaped again with something rare.No member, as you may believe,
        Was anxious such a place to leave,
                Until he had a taste at least
                Of all the dishes in the feast.The Brownies, when they break their fast,
                Will eat as long as viands last,
                And even birds can not depend
                On crumbs or pickings at the end:
                The plates were scraped, the kettles clean,
                And not a morsel to be seen,
                Ere Brownies from that table ran
                To shun the prying eyes of man.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES' HALLOW-EVE.[Illustration]

    On Hallow-eve, that night of fun,
     When elves and goblins frisk and run,
       And many games and tricks are tried
         At every pleasant fireside,
        The Brownies halted to survey
       A village that below them lay,
      And wondered as they rested there
    To hear the laughter fill the air
    That from the happy children came
    As they enjoyed some pleasant game.Said one: "What means this merry flow
    That comes so loudly from below,
    Uncommon pleasures must abound
    Where so much laughter can be found."Another said: "Now, by your leave,
    I'll tell you 't is All-Hallow-eve,
    When people meet to have their sport
    At curious games of every sort;
    I know them all from first to last,
    And now, before the night has passed,
    For some convenient place we'll start
    Without delay to play our part."Two dozen mouths commenced to show
    Their teeth in white and even row;
    Two dozen voices cried with speed,
    "The plan is good we're all agreed."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    And in a trice four dozen feet
    Went down the hill with even beat.Without a long or wearying race
    The Brownies soon secured a place
    That answered well in every way
    For all the games they wished to play.There tubs of water could be found,
    By which to stoop or kneel around,
    And strive to bring the pennies out
    That on the bottom slipped about.Then heads were wet and shoulders, too,
    Where some would still the coin pursue,
    And mouth about now here and there
    Without a pause or breath of air
    Until in pride, with joyful cries,
    They held aloft the captured prize.More stood the tempting bait beneath,
    And with a hasty snap of teeth
    The whirling apple thought to claim
    And shun the while the candle's flame,--
    But found that with such pleasure goes
    An eye-brow singed, or blistered nose.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    More named the oats as people do
    To try which hearts are false, which true,
    And on the griddle placed the pair
    To let them part or smoulder there;
    And smiled to see, through woe or weal,
    How often hearts were true as steel.Still others tried to read their fate
    Or fortune in a dish or plate,
    Learn whether they would ever wed,
    Or lead a single life instead;
    Or if their mate would be a blessing,
    Or prove a partner most distressing.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then others in the open air,
    Of fun and frolic had their share;
    Played "hide and seek," and "blindman's buff,"
    And "tag" o'er places smooth or rough,
    And "snap the whip" and "trip the toe,"
    And games that none but Brownies know.As if their lives at stake were placed,
    They jumped around and dodged and raced,
    And tumbled headlong to the ground
    When feet some hard obstruction found;
    At times across the level mead,
    Some proved their special claims to speed,
    And as reward of merit wore
    A wreath of green till sport was o'er.The hours flew past as hours will
    When joys do every moment fill;
    The moon grew weak and said good-night,
    And turned her pallid face from sight;
    Then weakening stars began to fail,
    But still the Brownies kept the vale;
    Full many a time had hours retired
    Much faster than the band desired,
    And pleasure seemed too sweet to lay
    Aside, because of coming day,
      But never yet with greater pain
        Did they behold the crimson stain
          That morning spread along the sky,
            And told them they must homeward fly




THE BROWNIES' [Illustration] FLAG-POLE.[Illustration]

    The Brownies through a village bound,
    Paused in their run to look around,
    And wondered why the central square
    Revealed no flag-pole tall and fair.Said one: "Without delay we'll go
    To woods that stand some miles below.The tall spruce lifts its tapering crest
    So straight and high above the rest,
    We soon can choose a flag-pole there
    To ornament this village square.Then every one a hand will lend
    To trim it off from end to end,
    To peel it smooth and paint it white,
    And hoist it in the square to-night."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then to the woods the Brownies ran
    At once to carry out their plan;
    While some ran here and there with speed
    For implements to serve their need,
    Some rambled through the forest free
    To find the proper kind of tree,
    Then climbed the tree while yet it stood
    To learn if it was sound and good,
                                   Without a flaw, a twist, or bend,
                                   To mar its looks from end to end.When one was found that suited well,
                                   To work the active Brownies fell;
      And soon with sticks beneath their load,
      The band in grand procession strode;
        It gave them quite enough to do
        To safely put the project through,
        But when they reached the square, at last,
        Some ropes around the pole were passed
        And from the tops of maples tall
        A crowd began to pull and haul,
        While others gathered at the base
        Until the flag-pole stood in place.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    For Brownies seldom idle stand
    When there is fun or work on hand.At night when darkness wraps us round
    They come from secret haunts profound,
    With brushes, pots of paint, and all,
    They clamber over fence and wall;
    And soon on objects here and there
    That hold positions high in air,
    And most attract the human eye,
    The marks of Brownie fingers lie.Sometimes with feet that never tire
    They climb the tall cathedral spire;
    When all the town is still below,
    Save watchmen pacing to and fro,
    By light of moon, and stars alone,
    They dust the marble and the stone,
          And with their brushes, small and great,
          They paint and gild the dial-plate;
          And bring the figures plain in sight
          That all may note Time's rapid flight.And accidents they often know
          While through the heavy works they go,
          Where slowly turning wheels at last
          In bad position hold them fast.But Brownies, notwithstanding all
          The hardships that may them befall,
          Still persevere in every case
          Till morning drives them from the place.And then with happy hearts they fly
          To hide away from human eye.[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES ON THE CANAL.[Illustration]

    One night the Brownies stood beside
    A long canal, whose silent tide
    Connected seaboard cities great
    With inland sections of the state.The laden boats, so large and strong,
    Were tied to trees by hawsers long;
    No boatmen stood by helm or oar,
    No mules were tugging on the shore;
    All work on land and water too
    Had been abandoned by the crew.Said one: "We see, without a doubt,
    What some dispute has brought about.Perhaps a strike for greater pay,
    For even rates, or shorter day,
    Has caused the boats to loiter here
    With cargoes costing some one dear.These cabbages so large and round
    Should, long ere this, the dish have found,
    Upon some kitchen-stove or range
    To spread an odor rich and strange;
    Those squashes, too, should not be lost
    By long exposure to the frost,
    When they would prove so great a prize
    To old and young, if baked in pies.And then those pippins, ripe and fair,
    From some fine orchard picked with care,
                    Should not to rot and ruin go,
                    Though work is hard or wages low,
                    When thousands would be glad to stew
                    The smallest apples there in view."[Illustration]

    Another said: "We lack the might
    To set the wrongs of labor right,
    But by the power within us placed
    We'll see that nothing goes to waste.So every hand must be applied
    That boats upon their way may glide."[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    Then some ran here and there with speed
    To find a team to suit their need.A pair of mules, that grazed about
    The grassy banks, were fitted out
                With straps and ropes without delay
                To start the boats upon their way;
                And next some straying goats were found,
                Where in a yard they nibbled round
                Destroying plants of rarest kind
                That owners in the town could find.Soon, taken from their rich repast,
    They found themselves in harness fast;
    Then into active service pressed
    They trod the tow-path with the rest.[Illustration]

    On deck some Brownies took their stand
    To man the helm, or give command,
    And oversee the work; while more
    Stayed with the teams upon the shore.At times the rope would drag along
            And catch on snags or branches long,
                    And cause delays they ill could bear,
                    For little time they had to spare.[Illustration]

            With accidents they often met,
            And some were bruised and more were wet;
            Some tumbled headlong down the hold;
            And some from heaping cargoes rolled.But what care Brownies for a bruise,
            Or garments wet, from hat to shoes,
            When enterprises bold and new
    Must ere the dawn be carried through?If half the band were drenched, no doubt
    The work would still be carried out,
    For extra strength would then be found
    In those who still were safe and sound.was the shout
    They stood and stared or ran about
    Till in the water, heels o'er head,
    Some members of the band were spread.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

    A few could swim, and held their own;
    But more went downward like a stone
    Until, without the plummet's aid,
            They learned how deep canals are made.In spite of all the kicks and flings
            That fright at such a moment brings,
    Through lack of art, or weight of fear,
    It looked as if their end was near.The order now to stop the team
    Would pass along with sign and scream,
    And those on land would know by this
    That something startling was amiss;
    And those on board could plainly see
    Unless assistance there could be,
    In shape of ropes and fingers strong,
    There'd be some vacancies, ere long![Illustration]

    By chance a net was to be had,
    That boatmen used for catching shad--
    A gill-net of the strongest kind,
    For heavy catches well designed;
    Few shad against its meshes ran
    But left their bones on some one's pan,
    This bulky thing the active crew
    Far overboard with promptness threw.A hold at once some Brownies found,
    While others in its folds were bound,
    Until like fish in great dismay
    Inside the net they struggling lay.But willing hands were overhead,
    And quickly from the muddy bed
    Where shedder crabs and turtles crawled
    The dripping net was upward hauled,
    With all the Brownies clinging fast,
    Till safe on deck they stood at last.[Illustration]

                    Sometimes a mule fell off the road
                    And in the stream with all its load.Then precious time would be consumed
    Before the trip could be resumed.Thus on they went from mile to mile,
    With many strange mishaps the while,
    But working bravely through the night
    Until the city came in sight.Said one: "Now, thanks to bearded goats
    And patient mules, the heavy boats
    For hours have glided on their way,
    And reached the waters of the bay.But see, the sun's about to show
    His colors to the world below,
    And other birds than those of night
    Begin to take their morning flight.Our time is up; we've done our best;
    The ebbing tide must do the rest;
    Now drifting downward to their pier
    Let barges unassisted steer,
    While we make haste, with nimble feet,
    To find in woods a safe retreat."[Illustration]

[Illustration]




THE BROWNIES IN THE STUDIO.The Brownies once approached in glee
    A slumbering city by the sea."In yonder town," the leader cried,
    "I hear the artist does reside
    Who pictures out, with patient hand,
    The doings of the Brownie band.""I'd freely give," another said,
    "The cap that now protects my head,
    To find the room, where, day by day,
    He shows us at our work or play."A third replied: "Your cap retain
    To shield your poll from snow or rain.His studio is farther down,
    Within a corner-building brown.So follow me a mile or more
    And soon we'll reach the office door."[Illustration]

    Then through the park, around the square,
    And down the broadest thoroughfare,
    The anxious Brownies quickly passed,
    And reached the building huge at last.[Illustration]

        They paused awhile to view the sight,
        To speak about its age and height,
        And read the signs, so long and wide,
        That met the gaze on every side.But little time was wasted there,
                For soon their feet had found the stair.And next the room, where oft are told
                Their funny actions, free and bold,
                Was honored by a friendly call
                From all the Brownies, great and small.[Illustration]

[Illustration]

                Then what a gallery they found,
                As here and there they moved around--
                For now they gaze upon a scene
                That showed them sporting on the green;
                Then, hastening o'er the fields with speed
                To help some farmer in his need.Said one, "Upon this desk, no doubt,
                Where now we cluster round about,
                Our doings have been plainly told
    From month to month, through heat and cold.And there's the ink, I apprehend,
    On which our very lives depend.Be careful, moving to and fro,
    Lest we upset it as we go.For who can tell what tales untold
            That darksome liquid may unfold!"[Illustration]

[Illustration]

            A telephone gave great delight
            To those who tried it half the night,
            Some asking after fresh supplies;
    Or if their stocks were on the rise;
    What ship was safe; what bank was firm;
    Or who desired a second term.Thus messages ran to and fro
    With "Who are you?"And all the repetitions known
    To those who use the telephone.[Illustration]

    "Oh, here's the pen, as I opine,"
    Said one, "that's written every line;
    Indebted to this pen are we
    For all our fame and history.""See here," another said, "I've found
    The pointed pencil, long and round,
    That pictures all our looks so wise,
            Our smiles so broad and staring eyes;
            'Tis well it draws us all aright,
            Or we might bear it off to-night.But glad are we to have our name
            In every region known to fame,
            To know that children lisp our praise,
            And on our faces love to gaze."Old pistols that brave service knew
    At Bunker Hill, were brought to view
    In mimic duels on the floor,
    And snapped at paces three or four;
    While from the foils the Brownies plied,
    The sparks in showers scattered wide,
    As thrust and parry, cut and guard,
    In swift succession followed hard.The British and Mongolian slash
    Were tried in turn with brilliant dash,
    Till foils, and skill, and temper too,
    Were amply tested through and through.[Illustration]

    They found old shields that bore the dint
    Of spears and arrow-heads of flint,
    And held them up in proper pose;
    Then rained upon them Spartan blows.[Illustration]

    Lay figures, draped in ancient styles,
    From some drew graceful bows and smiles,
    Until the laugh of comrades nigh
    Led them to look with sharper eye.A portrait now they criticize,
    Which every one could recognize:
    The features, garments, and the style,
    Soon brought to every face a smile.Some tried a hand at painting there,
    And showed their skill was something rare;
    While others talked and rummaged through
    The desk to find the stories new,
    That told about some late affair,
    Of which the world was not aware.But pleasure seemed to have the power
    To hasten every passing hour,
    And bring too soon the morning chime,
    However well they note the time.Now, from a chapel's brazen bell,
    The startling hint of morning fell,
    And Brownies realized the need
    Of leaving for their haunts with speed.So down the staircase to the street
    They made their way with nimble feet,
    And ere the sun could show his face,
    The band had reached a hiding-place.But it is also a fact of very great importance that
mere monotony of diet has a most serious effect upon health; variety
of food is not merely a pandering to gourmandism or greed, but a real
sanitary benefit, aiding digestion and assimilation.Our Board of Trade
has nothing to do with the food scales of ships, but Mr.Gray hints that
the Legislature will have to interfere unless shipowners look to it
themselves.The ease with which preserved foods of all kinds can be
obtained and carried now removes the last shadow of an excuse for
backwardness in this matter, and in particular the provision of a large
supply of potatoes, both fresh and dried, ought to be an unceasing care;
this is done on board American ships, and to this is doubtless owing in
a great part the healthiness of their crews.Scurvy in the present
day is a disgrace to shipowners and masters; and if public opinion is
insufficient to protect the seamen, the legislature will undoubtedly
step in and do so.And now let me close by pointing out that the study of this commonplace
matter of eating and drinking opens out to us the conception of the
grand unity of nature; since we see that the body of man differs in no
way essentially from other natural combinations, but is subject to
the same universal physical laws, in which there is no blindness, no
variableness, no mere chance, and disobedience of which is followed as
surely by retribution as even the keenest eschatologist might desire.*       *       *       *       *




RATTLESNAKE POISON.By HENRY H. CROFT.Some time since, in a paper to which I am unfortunately unable to refer,
a French chemist affirmed that the poisonous principle in snakes, or
eliminated by snakes, was of the nature of an alkaloid, and gave a name
to this class of bodies.Pedler has shown that snake poison is destroyed or neutralized
by means of platinic chloride, owing probably to the formation of an
insoluble double platinic chloride, such as is formed with almost if not
all alkaloids.In this country (Texas) where rattlesnakes are very common, and persons
camping out much exposed to their bites, a very favorite anecdote, or
_remedia_ as the Mexicans cull it, is a strong solution of iodine in
potassium iodide.[1]

[Footnote 1: The solution is applied as soon as possible to the wound,
preferably enlarged, and a few drops taken internally.The common
Mexican _remedia_ is the root of the _Agave virginica_ mashed or chewed
and applied to the wound, while part is swallowed.Great faith is placed in this root by all residents here, who are seldom
I without it, but, I have had no experience of it myself; and the
internal administration is no doubt useless.Even the wild birds know of this root; the queer paisano (?ground
woodpecker) which eats snakes, when wounded by a _vibora de cascabel_,
runs into woods, digs up and eats a root of the agave, just like the
mongoose; but more than that, goes back, polishes off his enemy, and
eats him.This has been told me by Mexicans who, it may be remarked, are
not _always_ reliable.]I have had occasion to prove the efficacy of this mixture in two cases
of _cascabel_ bites, one on a buck, the other on a dog; and it occurred
to me that the same explanation of its action might be given as above
for the platinum salt, viz., the formation of an insoluble iodo compound
as with ordinary alkaloids if the snake poison really belongs to this
class.Having last evening killed a moderate sized rattlesnake--_Crotalus
horridus_--which had not bitten anything, I found the gland fully
charged with the white opaque poison; on adding iodine solution to a
drop of this a dense light-brown precipitate was immediately formed,
quite similar to that obtained with most alkaloids, exhibiting under the
microscope no crystalline structure.In the absence of iodine a good extemporaneous solution for testing
alkaloids, and perhaps a snake poison antidote, may be made by adding a
few drops of ferric chloride to solution of potassium of iodide; this
is a very convenient test agent which I used in my laboratory for many
years.Although rattlesnake poison could be obtained here in very considerable
quantity, it is out of my power to make such experiments as I could
desire, being without any chemical appliances and living a hundred miles
or more from any laboratory.The same may be said with regard to books,
and possibly the above iodine reaction has been already described.Richards states that the cobra poison is destroyed by potassium
permanganate; but this is no argument in favor of that salt as an
antidote.Pedler also refers to it, but allows that it would not be
probably of any use after the poison had been absorbed.Of this I
think there can be no doubt, remembering the easy decomposition of
permanganate by most organic substances, and I cannot but think that the
medicinal or therapeutic advantages of that salt, taken internally, are
equally problematical, unless the action is supposed to take place in
the stomach.In the bladder of the same rattlesnake I found a considerable
quantity of light-brown amorphous ammonium urate, the urine pale
yellow.--_Chemical News_.*       *       *       *       *




THE CHINESE SIGN MANUAL.D. J. Macgowan, in Medical Reports of China.Two writers in _Nature_, both having for their theme "Skin-furrows on
the Hand," solicit information on the subject from China.[1] As the
subject is considered to have a bearing on medical jurisprudence and
ethnology as well, this report is a suitable vehicle for responding to
the demand.[Footnote 1: Henry Faulds, Tzukiyi Hospital, Tokio, Japan.W. J.
Herschel, Oxford, England.--_Nature_, 28th October and 25th November,
1880.]Faulds' observations on the finger-tips of the Japanese have an
ethnic bearing and relate to the subject of heredity.Herschel
considers the subject as an agent of Government, he having charge for
twenty years of registration offices in India, where he employed finger
marks as sign manuals, the object being to prevent personation and
repudiation.Doolittle, in his "Social Life of the Chinese," describes
the custom.I cannot now refer to native works where the practice of
employing digital rugae as a sign manual is alluded to.I doubt if its
employment in the courts is of ancient date.Well-informed natives think
that it came into vogue subsequent to the Han period; if so, it is in
Egypt that earliest evidence of the practice is to be found.Just as the
Chinese courts now require criminals to sign confessions by impressing
thereto the whorls of their thumb-tips--the right thumb in the case of
women, the left in the case of men--so the ancient Egyptians, it
is represented, required confessions to be sealed with their
thumbnails--most likely the tip of the digit, as in China.Great
importance is attached in the courts to this digital form of signature,
"finger form."Without a confession no criminal can be legally executed,
and the confession to be valid must be attested by the thumb-print
of the prisoner.No direct coercion is employed to secure this; a
contumacious culprit may, however, be tortured until he performs the
act which is a prerequisite to his execution.Digital signatures are
sometimes required in the army to prevent personation; the general
in command at Wenchow enforces it on all his troops.A document thus
attested can no more be forged or repudiated than a photograph--not so
easily, for while the period of half a lifetime effects great changes
in the physiognomy, the rugae of the fingers present the same appearance
from the cradle to the grave; time writes no wrinkles there.In the
army everywhere, when the description of a person is written down, the
relative number of volutes and coniferous finger-tips is noted.It
is called taking the "whelk striae," the fusiform being called "rice
baskets," and the volutes "peck measures."A person unable to write, the
form of signature which defies personation or repudiation is required in
certain domestic cases, as in the sale of children or women.Often when
a child is sold the parents affix their finger marks to the bill of
sale; when a husband puts away his wife, giving her a bill of divorce,
he marks the document with his entire palm; and when a wife is sold, the
purchaser requires the seller to stamp the paper with hands and feet,
the four organs duly smeared with ink.Professional fortune tellers in
China take into account almost the entire system of the person whose
future they attempt to forecast, and of course they include palmistry,
but the rugae of the finger-ends do not receive much attention.Amateur
fortune-tellers, however, discourse as glibly on them as phrenologists
do of "bumps"--it is so easy.In children the relative number of volute
and conical striae indicate their future."If there are nine volutes,"
says a proverb, "to one conical, the boy will attain distinction without
toil."Regarded from an ethnological point of view, I can discover merely that
the rugae of Chinamen's fingers differ from Europeans', but there is so
little uniformity observable that they form no basis for distinction,
and while the striae may be noteworthy points in certain medico-legal
questions, heredity is not one of them.*       *       *       *       *




LUCIDITY.At the close of an interesting address lately delivered at the reopening
of the Liverpool University College and School of Medicine, Mr.Matthew
Arnold said if there was one word which he should like to plant in the
memories of his audience, and to leave sticking there after he had gone,
it was the word _lucidity_.If he had to fix upon the three great wants
at this moment of the three principal nations of Europe, he should say
that the great want of the French was morality, that the great want of
the Germans was civil courage, and that our own great want was lucidity.Our own want was, of course, what concerned us the most.People were apt
to remark the defects which accompanied certain qualities, and to think
that the qualities could not be desirable because of the defects which
they saw accompanying them.There was no greater and salutary lesson for
men to learn than that a quality may be accompanied, naturally perhaps,
by grave dangers; that it may actually present itself accompanied by
terrible defects, and yet that it might itself be indispensable.Let him
illustrate what he meant by an example, the force of which they would
all readily feel.Seriousness was a quality of our nation.Perhaps
seriousness was always accompanied by certain dangers.But, at any rate,
many of our French neighbors would say that they found our seriousness
accompanied by so many false ideas, so much prejudice, so much that was
disagreeable, that it could not have the value which we attributed to
it.Let them follow the same
mode of reasoning as to the quality of lucidity.The French had a
national turn for lucidity as we had a national turn for seriousness.Perhaps a national turn for lucidity carried with it always certain
dangers.Be this as it might, it was certain that we saw in the French,
along with their lucidity, a want of seriousness, a want of reverence,
and other faults, which greatly displeased us.Many of us were inclined
in consequence to undervalue their lucidity, or to deny that they
had it.We were wrong: it existed as our seriousness existed; it was
valuable as our seriousness was valuable.Both the one and the other
were valuable, and in the end indispensable.It was negatively that the French have it, and he
would therefore deal with its negative character merely.Negatively,
lucidity was the perception of the want of truth and validness in
notions long current, the perception that they are no longer possible,
that their time is finished, and they can serve us no more.All through
the last century a prodigious travail for lucidity was going forward
in France.Its principal agent was a man whose name excited generally
repulsion in England, Voltaire.Voltaire did a great deal of harm in
France.But it was not by his lucidity that he did harm; he did it by
his want of seriousness, his want of reverence, his want of sense for
much that is deepest in human nature.Conduct was three-fourths of life, and a man who
worked for conduct, therefore, worked for more than a man who worked for
intelligence.But having promised this, it might be said that the Luther
of the eighteenth century and of the cultivated classes was Voltaire.As Luther had an antipathy to what was immoral, so Voltaire had an
antipathy to what was absurd, and both of them made war upon the object
of their antipathy with such masterly power, with so much conviction,
so much energy, so much genius, that they carried their world with
them--Luther his Protestant world, and Voltaire his French world--and
the cultivated classes throughout the continent of Europe generally.Voltaire had more than negative lucidity; he had the large and true
conception that a number and equilibrium of activities were necessary
for man."_Il faut douner a notre ame toutes les formes possibles_"
was a maxim which Voltaire really and truly applied in practice,
"advancing," as Michelet finely said of him, in every direction with
a marvelous vigor and with that conquering ambition which Vico called
_mens heroica_.Voltaire's signal characteristic was his
lucidity, his negative lucidity.There was a great and free intellectual movement in England in the
eighteenth century--indeed, it was from England that it passed into
France; but the English had not that strong natural bent for lucidity
which the French had.Our leading thinkers had not the genius and passion for lucidity which
distinguished Voltaire.In their free inquiry they soon found themselves
coming into collision with a number of established facts, beliefs,
conventions.Thereupon all sorts of practical considerations began to
sway them.The danger signal went up, they often stopped short, turned
their eyes another way, or drew down a curtain between themselves and
the light."It seems highly probable," said Voltaire, "that nature has
made thinking a portion of the brain, as vegetation is a function of
trees; that we think by the brain just as we walk by the feet."So our
reason, at least, would lead us to conclude, if the theologians did not
assure us of the contrary; such, too, was the opinion of Locke, but he
did not venture to announce it.The French Revolution came, England grew
to abhor France, and was cut off from the Continent, did great things,
gained much, but not in lucidity.The Continent was reopened, the
century advanced, time and experience brought their lessons, lovers of
free and clear thought, such as the late John Stuart Mill, arose among
us.But we could not say that they had by any means founded among us the
reign of lucidity.Let them consider that movement of which we were hearing so much just
now: let them look at the Salvation Army and its operations.They would
see numbers, funds, energy, devotedness, excitement, conversions, and
a total absence of lucidity.A little lucidity would make the whole
movement impossible.That movement took for granted as its basis what
was no longer possible or receivable; its adherents proceeded in all
they did on the assumption that that basis was perfectly solid, and
neither saw that it was not solid, nor ever even thought of asking
themselves whether it was solid or not.Taking a very different movement, and one of far higher dignity and
import, they had all had before their minds lately the long-devoted,
laborious, influential, pure, pathetic life of Dr.Pusey, which had just
ended.Many of them had also been reading in the lively volumes of that
acute, but not always good-natured rattle, Mr.Mozley, an account of
that great movement which took from Dr.Of its
later stage of Ritualism they had had in this country a now celebrated
experience.It had produced men to
be respected, men to be admired, men to be beloved, men of learning,
goodness, genius, and charm.But could they resist the truth that
lucidity would have been fatal to it?The movers of all those questions
about apostolical succession, church patristic authority, primitive
usage, postures, vestments--questions so passionately debated, and on
which he would not seek to cast ridicule--did not they all begin by
taking for granted something no longer possible or receivable, build on
this basis as if it were indubitably solid, and fail to see that their
basis not being solid, all they built upon it was fantastic?He would not say that negative lucidity was in itself a satisfactory
possession, but he said that it was inevitable and indispensable, and
that it was the condition of all serious construction for the future.Without it at present a man or a nation was intellectually and
spiritually all abroad.If they saw it accompanied in France by much
that they shrank from, they should reflect that in England it would
have influences joined with it which it had not in France--the natural
seriousness of the people, their sense of reverence and respect, their
love for the past.Come it must; and here where it had been so late in
coming, it would probably be for the first time seen to come without
danger.Capitals were natural centers of mental movement, and it was natural for
the classes with most leisure, most freedom, most means of cultivation,
and most conversance with the wide world to have lucidity though often
they had it not.To generate a spirit of lucidity in provincial towns,
and among the middle classes bound to a life of much routine and plunged
in business, was more difficult.Schools and universities, with serious
and disinterested studies, and connecting those studies the one with the
other and continuing them into years of manhood, were in this case the
best agency they could use.It might be slow, but it was sure.Such
an agency they were now going to employ.Might it fulfill all their
expectations!Might their students, in the words quoted just now,
advance in every direction with a marvelous vigor, and with that
conquering ambition which Vico called _mens heroica_!And among the many
good results of this, might one result be the acquisition in their midst
of that indispensable spirit--the spirit of lucidity!*       *       *       *       *




ON SOME APPARATUS THAT PERMIT OF ENTERING FLAMES.[Footnote: A. de Rochas in the _Revue Scientifique_.]In the following notes I shall recall a few experiments that indicate
under what conditions the human organism is permitted to remain unharmed
amid flames.These experiments were published in England in 1882, in the
twelfth letter from Brewster to Walter Scott on natural magic.They are,
I believe, not much known in France, and possess a practical interest
for those who are engaged in the art of combating fires.At the end of the last century Humphry Davy observed that, on placing a
very fine wire gauze over a flame, the latter was cooled to such a
point that it could not traverse the meshes.This phenomenon, which he
attributed to the conductivity and radiating power of the metal, he soon
utilized in the construction of a lamp for miners.Some years afterward Chevalier Aldini, of Milan, conceived the idea of
making a new application of Davy's discovery in the manufacture of an
envelope that should permit a man to enter into the midst of flames.This envelope, which was made of metallic gauze with 1-25th of an inch
meshes, was composed of five pieces, as follows: (1) a helmet, with
mask, large enough, to allow a certain space between it and the internal
bonnet of which I shall speak; (2) a cuirass with armlets; (3) a skirt
for the lower part of the belly and the thighs; (4) a pair of boots
formed of a double wire gauze; and (5) a shield five feet long by one
and a half wide, formed of metallic gauze stretched over a light iron
frame.Beneath this armor the experimenter was clad in breeches and a
close coat of coarse cloth that had previously been soaked in a solution
of alum.The head, hands, and feet were covered by envelopes of asbestos
cloth whose fibers were about a half millimeter in diameter.The bonnet
contained apertures for the eyes, nose, and ears, and consisted of a
single thickness of fabric, as did the stockings, but the gloves were of
double thickness, so that the wearer could seize burning objects with
the hands.Aldini, convinced of the services that his apparatus might render to
humanity, traveled over Europe and gave gratuitous representations with
it.The exercises generally took place in the following order: Aldini
began by first wrapping his finger in asbestos and then with a double
layer of wire gauze.He then held it for some instants in the flame of
a candle or alcohol lamp.One of his assistants afterward put on the
asbestos glove of which I have spoken, and, protecting the palm of his
hand with another piece of asbestos cloth, seized a piece of red-hot
iron from a furnace and slowly carried it to a distance of forty or
fifty meters, lighted some straw with it, and then carried it back to
the furnace.On other occasions, the experimenters, holding firebrands
in their hands, walked for five minutes over a large grating under which
fagots were burning.In order to show how the head, eyes, and lungs were protected by the
wire gauze apparatus, one of the experimenters put on the asbestos
bonnet, helmet, and cuirass, and fixed the shield in front of his
breast.Then, in a chafing dish placed on a level with his shoulder, a
great fire of shavings was lighted, and care was taken to keep it up.Into the midst of these flames the experimenter then plunged his head
and remained thus five or six minutes with his face turned toward them.In an exhibition given at Paris before a committee from the Academic
des Sciences, there were set up two parallel fences formed of straw,
connected by iron wire to light wicker work, and arranged so as to leave
between them a passage 3 feet wide by 30 long.The heat was so intense,
when the fences were set on fire, that no one could approach nearer than
20 or 25 feet; and the flames seemed to fill the whole space between
them, and rose to a height of 9 or 10 feet.Six men clad in the Aldini
suit went in, one behind the other, between the blazing fences, and
walked slowly backward and forward in the narrow passage, while the fire
was being fed with fresh combustibles from the exterior.One of these
men carried on his back, in an ozier basket covered with wire gauze, a
child eight years of age, who had on no other clothing than an asbestos
bonnet.This same man, having the child with him, entered on another
occasion a clear fire whose flames reached a height of 18 feet, and
whose intensity was such that it could not be looked at.He remained
therein so long that the spectators began to fear that he had succumbed;
but he finally came out safe and sound.One of the conclusions to be drawn from the facts just stated is that
man can breathe in the midst of flames.This marvelous property cannot
be attributed exclusively to the cooling of the air by its passage
through the gauze before reaching the lungs; it shows also a very great
resistance of our organs to the action of heat.The following, moreover,
are direct proofs of such resistance.In England, in their first
experiment, Messrs.Joseph Banks, Charles Blagden, and Dr.Solander
remained for ten minutes in a hot-house whose temperature was 211 deg.Fahr., and their bodies preserved therein very nearly the usual heat.On
breathing against a thermometer they caused the mercury to fall several
degrees.Each expiration, especially when it was somewhat strong,
produced in their nostrils an agreeable impression of coolness, and the
same impression was also produced on their fingers when breathed upon.When they touched themselves their skin seemed to be as cold as that of
a corpse; but contact with their watch chains caused them to experience
a sensation like that of a burn.A thermometer placed under the tongue
of one of the experimenters marked 98 deg.Fahr., which is the normal
temperature of the human species.Emboldened by these first results, Blagden entered a hot-house in which
the thermometer in certain parts reached 262 deg.He remained therein
eight minutes, walked about in all directions, and stopped in the
coolest part, which was at 240 deg.During all this time he
experienced no painful sensations; but, at the end of seven minutes, he
felt an oppression of the lungs that inquieted him and caused him to
leave the place.His pulse at that moment showed 144 beats to the
minute, that is to say, double what it usually did.To ascertain whether
there was any error in the indications of the thermometer, and to find
out what effect would take place on inert substances exposed to the hot
air that he had breathed, Blogden placed some eggs in a zinc plate in
the hot-house, alongside the thermometer, and found that in twenty
minutes they were baked hard.A case is reported where workmen entered a furnace for drying moulds, in
England, the temperature of which was 177 deg., and whose iron sole plate
was so hot that it carbonized their wooden shoes.In the immediate
vicinity of this furnace the temperature rose to 160 deg.Persons not of
the trade who approached anywhere near the furnace experienced pain in
the eyes, nose, and ears.A baker is cited in Angoumois, France, who spent ten minutes in a
furnace at 132 deg.C.

The resistance of the human organism to so high temperatures can be
attributed to several causes.First, it has been found that the quantity
of carbonic acid exhaled by the lungs, and consequently the chemical
phenomena of internal combustion that are a source of animal heat,
diminish in measure as the external temperature rises.Hence, a conflict
which has for result the retardation of the moment at which a living
being will tend, without obstacle, to take the temperature of the
surrounding medium.On another hand, it has been observed that man
resists heat so much the less in proportion as the air is saturated
with vapors.Berger, who supported for seven minutes a temperature
varying from 109 deg.C. in dry air, could remain only twelve
minutes in a bagnio whose temperature rose from 41 deg.At the
Hammam of Paris the highest temperature obtained is 87 deg., and Dr.E.
Martin has not been able to remain therein more than five minutes.This
physician reports that in 1743, the thermometer having exceeded 40 deg.at
Pekin, 14,000 persons perished.These facts are explained by the cooling
that the evaporation of perspiration produces on the surface of the
body.Edwards has calculated that such evaporation is ten times greater
in dry air in motion than in calm and humid air.The observations become
still more striking when the skin is put in contact with a liquid or a
solid which suppresses perspiration.Lemoine endured a bath of Bareges
water of 37 deg.for half an hour; but at 45 deg.he could not remain in it more
than seven minutes, and the perspiration began to flow at the end of six
minutes.According to Brewster, persons who experience no malaise near
a fire which communicates a temperature of 100 deg.C. to them, can hardly
bear contact with alcohol and oil at 55 deg.The facts adduced permit us to understand how it was possible to bear
one of the proofs to which it is said those were submitted who wished
to be initiated into the Egyptian mysteries.In a vast vaulted chamber
nearly a hundred feet long, there were erected two fences formed of
posts, around which were wound branches of Arabian balm, Egyptian thorn,
and tamarind--all very flexible and inflammable woods.When this was set
on fire the flames arose as far as the vault, licked it, and gave the
chamber the appearance of a hot furnace, the smoke escaping through
pipes made for the purpose.Then the door was suddenly opened before the
neophyte, and he was ordered to traverse this burning place, whose floor
was composed of an incandescent grating.The Abbe Terrason recounts all these details in his historic romance
"Sethos," printed at the end of last century.Unfortunately literary
frauds were in fashion then, and the book, published as a translation of
an old Greek manuscript, gives no indication of sources.I have sought
in special works for the data which the abbe must have had as a basis,
but I have not been able to find them.I suppose, however, that
this description, which is so precise, is not merely a work of the
imagination.The author goes so far as to give the dimensions of the
grating (30 feet by 8), and, greatly embarrassed to explain how his hero
was enabled to traverse it without being burned, is obliged to suppose
it to have been formed of very thick bars, between which Sethos had care
to place his feet.He who had the
courage to rush, head bowed, into the midst of the flames, certainly
would not have amused himself by choosing the place to put his feet.Braving the fire that surrounded his entire body, he must have had no
other thought than that of reaching the end of his dangerous voyage as
soon as possible.We cannot see very well, moreover, how this immense
grate, lying on the ground, was raised to a red heat and kept at such a
temperature.It is infinitely more simple to suppose that between the
two fences there was a ditch sufficiently deep in which a fire had
also been lighted, and which was covered by a grating as in the Aldini
experiments.It is even probable that this grating was of copper,
which, illuminated by the fireplace, must have presented a terrifying
brilliancy, while in reality it served only to prevent the flames from
the fireplace reaching him who dared to brave them.*       *       *       *       *




THE BUILDING STONE SUPPLY.The use of stone as a building material was not resorted to, except to
a trifling extent, in this country until long after the need of such a
solid substance was felt.The early settler contented himself with the
log cabin, the corduroy road, and the wooden bridge, and loose stone
enough for foundation purposes could readily be gathered from the
surface of the earth.Even after the desirability of more handsome and
durable building material for public edifices in the colonial cities
than wood became apparent, the ample resources which nature had afforded
in this country were overlooked, and brick and stone were imported by
the Dutch and English settlers from the Old World.Thus we find the
colonists of the New Netherlands putting yellow brick on their list
of non-dutiable imports in 1648; and such buildings in Boston as are
described as being "fairly set forth with brick, tile, slate, and
stone," were thus provided only with foreign products.Isolated
instances of quarrying stone are known to have occurred in the last
century; but they are rare.The edifice known as "King's Chapel,"
Boston, erected in 1752, is the first one on record as being built from
American stone; this was granite, brought from Braintree, Mass.Granite is a rock particularly abundant in New England, though also
found in lesser quantities elsewhere in this country.The first granite
quarries that were extensively developed were those at Quincy, Mass.,
and work began at that point early in the present century.The fame of
the stone became widespread, and it was sent to distant markets--even to
New Orleans.The old Merchants' Exchange in New York (afterward used as
a custom house) the Astor House in that city, and the Custom House in
New Orleans, all nearly or quite fifty years old, were constructed of
Quincy granite, as were many other fine buildings along the Atlantic
coast.In later years, not only isolated public edifices, but also whole
blocks of stores, have been constructed of this material.It was from
the Quincy quarries that the first railroad in this country was built;
this was a horse-railroad, three miles long, extending to Neponset
River, built in 1827.Other points in Massachusetts have been famed for their excellent
granite.After Maine was set off as a distinct State, Fox Island
acquired repute for its granite, and built up an extensive traffic
therein.Westerly, R.I., has also been engaged in quarrying this
valuable rock for many years, most of its choicer specimens having been
wrought for monumental purposes.Statues and other elaborate monumental
designs are now extensively made therefrom.Smaller pieces and a coarser
quality of the stone are here and elsewhere along the coast obtained in
large quantities for the construction of massive breakwaters to protect
harbors.Another point famous for its granite is Staten Island, New
York.This stone weighs 180 pounds to the cubic foot, while the Quincy
granite weighs but 165.The Staten Island product is used not only for
building purposes, but is also especially esteemed for paving after both
the Russ and Belgian patents.New York and other cities derive large
supplies from this source.The granite of Weehawken, N.J., is of the
same character, and greatly in demand.Port Deposit, Md., and Richmond,
Va, are also centers of granite production.Near Abbeville, S.C., and
in Georgia, granite is found quite like that of Quincy.Much southern
granite, however, decomposes readily, and is almost as soft as clay.This variety of stone is found in great abundance in the Rocky
Mountains; but, except to a slight extent in California, it is not yet
quarried there.Granite, having little grain, can be cut into blocks of almost any size
and shape.Specimens as much as eighty feet long have been taken out and
transported great distances.The quarrying is done by drilling a series
of small holes, six inches or more deep and almost the same distance
apart, inserting steel wedges along the whole line and then tapping each
gently with a hammer in succession, in order that the strain may be
evenly distributed.A building material that came into use earlier than granite is known as
freestone or sandstone; although its first employment does not date back
further than the erection of King's Chapel, Boston, already referred to
as the earliest well-known occasion where granite was used in building.Altogether the most famous American sandstone quarries are those at
Portland, on the Connecticut River, opposite Middletown.These were
worked before the Revolution; and their product has been shipped to many
distant points in the country.The long rows of "brownstone fronts" in
New York city are mostly of Portland stone, though in many cases the
walls are chiefly of brick covered with thin layers of the stone.The
old red sandstone of the Connecticut valley is distinguished in geology
for the discovery of gigantic fossil footprints of birds, first noticed
in the Portland quarries in 1802.Some of these footprints measured
ten to sixteen inches, and they were from four to six feet apart.The
sandstone of Belleville, N.J., has also extensive use and reputation.Trinity Church in New York city and the Boston Atheneum are built of the
product of these quarries; St.Lawrence County, New York, is noted also
for a fine bed of sandstone.At Potsdam it is exposed to a depth of
seventy feet.There are places though, in New England, New York, and
Eastern Pennsylvania, where a depth of three hundred feet has been
reached.The Potsdam sandstone is often split to the thinness of an
inch.It hardens by exposure, and is often used for smelting furnace
hearth-stones.Shawangunk Mountain, in Ulster County, yields a sandstone
of inferior quality, which has been unsuccessfully tried for paving;
as it wears very unevenly.From Ulster, Greene, and Albany Counties
sandstone slabs for sidewalks are extensively quarried for city use;
the principal outlets of these sections being Kingston, Saugerties,
Coxsackie, Bristol, and New Baltimore, on the Hudson.In this region
quantities amounting to millions of square feet are taken out in large
sheets, which are often sawed into the sizes desired.The vicinity of
Medina, in Western New York, yields a sandstone extensively used in that
section for paving and curbing, and a little for building.A rather poor
quality of this stone has been found along the Potomac, and some of it
was used in the erection of the old Capitol building at Washington.Ohio yields a sandstone that is of a light gray color; Berea, Amherst,
Vermilion, and Massillon are the chief points of production.Genevieve, Mo., yields a stone of fine grain of a light straw color,
which is quite equal to the famous Caen stone of France.The Lake
Superior sandstones are dark and coarse grained, but strong.In some parts of the country, where neither granite nor sandstone
is easily procured, blue and gray limestone are sometimes used for
building, and, when hammer dressed, often look like granite.A serious
objection to their use, however, is the occasional presence of iron,
which rusts on exposure, and defaces the building.In Western New York
they are widely used.Topeka stone, like the coquine of Florida and
Bermuda, is soft like wood when first quarried, and easily wrought,
but it hardens on exposure.The limestones of Canton, Mo., Joliet and
Athens, Ill., Dayton, Sandusky, Marblehead, and other points in Ohio,
Ellittsville, Ind., and Louisville and Bowling Green, Ky., are great
favorites west.In many of these regions limestone is extensively used
for macadamizing roads, for which it is excellently adapted.It also
yields excellent slabs or flags for sidewalks.One of the principal uses of this variety of stone is its conversion, by
burning, into lime for building purposes.All limestones are by no
means equally excellent in this regard.Thomaston lime, burned with
Pennsylvania coal, near the Penobscot River, has had a wide reputation
for nearly half a century.It has been shipped thence to all points
along the Atlantic coast, invading Virginia as far as Lynchburg, and
going even to New Orleans, Smithfield, R.I., and Westchester County,
N.Y., near the lower end of the Highlands, also make a particularly
excellent quality of lime.Kingston, in Ulster County, makes an inferior
sort for agricultural purposes.The Ohio and other western stones yield
a poor lime, and that section is almost entirely dependent on the east
for supplies.Marbles, like limestones, with which they are closely related, are very
abundant in this country, and are also to be found in a great variety of
colors.As early as 1804 American marble was used for statuary purposes.Early in the century it also obtained extensive employment for
gravestones.Its use for building purposes has been more recent than
granite and sandstone in this country; and it is coming to supersede the
latter to a great degree.For mantels, fire-places, porch pillars, and
like ornamental purposes, however, our variegated, rich colored and
veined or brecciated marbles were in use some time before exterior walls
were made from them.Among the earliest marble buildings were Girard
College in Philadelphia and the old City Hall in New York, and the
Custom House in the latter city, afterward used for a sub-treasury.The
new Capitol building at Washington is among the more recent structures
composed of this material.Our exports of marble to Cuba and elsewhere
amount to over $300,000 annually, although we import nearly the same
amount from Italy.And yet an article can be found in the United States
fully as fine as the famous Carrara marble.We refer to that which comes
from Rutland, Vt.This state yields the largest variety and choicest
specimens.The marble belt runs both ways from Rutland County, where
the only quality fit for statuary is obtained.Toward the north it
deteriorates by growing less sound, though finer in grain; while to
the south it becomes coarser.A beautiful black marble is obtained at
Shoreham, Vt.There are also handsome brecciated marbles in the same
state; and in the extreme northern part, near Lake Champlain, they
become more variegated and rich in hue.Such other marble as is found
in New England is of an inferior quality.The pillars of Girard
College came from Berkshire, Mass., which ranks next after Vermont in
reputation.The marble belt extends from New England through New York, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Virginia, Tennessee, and the
Carolinas, to Georgia and Alabama.Some of the variegated and high
colored varieties obtained near Knoxville, Tenn., nearly equal that of
Vermont.The Rocky Mountains contain a vast abundance and variety.Slate was known to exist in this country to a slight extent in colonial
days.It was then used for gravestones, and to some extent for roofing
and school purposes.It is
stated that a slate quarry was operated in Northampton County, Pa., as
early as 1805.In 1826 James M. Porter and Samuel Taylor engaged in the
business, obtaining their supplies from the Kittanninny Mountains.From
this time the business developed rapidly, the village of Slateford being
an outgrowth of it, and large rafts being employed to float the product
down the Schuylkill to Philadelphia.By 1860 the industry had reached
the capacity of 20,000 cases of slate, valued at $10 a case, annually.In 1839 quarries were opened in the Piscataquis River, forty miles
north of Bangor, Me., but poor transportation facilities retarded the
business.Vermont began to yield in 1852.New York's quarries are
confined to Washington County, near the Vermont line.Maryland has
a limited supply from Harford County.The Huron Mountains, north of
Marquette, Mich., contain slate, which is also said to exist in Pike
County, Ga.Grindstones, millstones, and whetstones are quarried in New York, Ohio,
Michigan, Pennsylvania, and other States.Mica is found at Acworth and
Grafton, N. H., and near Salt Lake, but our chief supply comes from
Haywood, Yancey, Mitchell, and Macon counties, in North Carolina, and
our product is so large that we can afford to export it.Other stones,
such as silex, for making glass, etc., are found in profusion in various
parts of the country, but we have no space to enter into a detailed
account of them at present.--_Pottery and Glassware Reporter_.*       *       *       *       *




AN INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.The most interesting change of which the Census gives account is the
increase in the number of farms.The number has virtually doubled within
twenty years.The population of the country has not increased in like
proportion.A large part of the increase in number of farms has been due
to the division of great estates.Nor has this occurred, as some may
imagine, exclusively in the Southern States and the States to which
immigration and migration have recently been directed.It is an
important fact that the multiplication of farms has continued even in
the older Northern States, though the change has not been as great in
these as in States of the far West or the South.In New York there has
been an increase of 25,000, or 11.5 per cent, in the number of farms
since 1870; in New Jersey the increase has been 12.2 per cent., and in
Pennsylvania 22.7 per cent., though the increase in population, and
doubtless in the number of persons engaged in farming, has been much
smaller.Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois also, have been considered fully
settled States for years, at least in an agricultural point of view, and
yet the number of farms has increased 26.1 per cent, in ten years in
Ohio, 20.3 percent, in Indiana, and 26.1 per cent, in Illinois.The
obvious explanation is that the growth of many cities and towns has
created a market for a far greater supply of those products which may be
most advantageously grown upon farms of moderate size; but even if this
fully accounts for the phenomenon, the change must be recognized as one
of the highest importance industrially, socially, and politically.The
man who owns or rents and cultivates a farm stands on a very different
footing from the laborer who works for wages.It is not a small matter
that, in these six States alone, there are 205,000 more owners or
managers of farms than there were only a decade ago.As we go further toward the border, west or north, the influence of the
settlement of new land is more distinctly felt.Even in Michigan, where
new railroads have opened new regions to settlement, the increase in
number of farms has been over 55 per cent.In Wisconsin, though the
increase in railroad mileage has been about the same as in Michigan, the
reported increase in number of farms has been only 28 per cent., but in
Iowa it rises to 60 per cent., and in Minnesota to nearly 100 per cent.In Kansas the number of farms is 138,561, against 38,202 in 1870; in
Nebraska 63,387, against 12,301; and in Dakota 17,435, against 1,720.In
these regions the process is one of creation of new States rather than a
change in the social and industrial condition of the population.Some Southern States have gained largely, but the increase in these,
though very great, is less surprising than the new States of the
Northwest.The prevailing tendency of Southern agriculture to large
farms and the employment of many hands is especially felt in States
where land is still abundant.The greatest increase is in Texas, where
174,184 farms are reported, against 61,125 in 1870; in Florida, with
23,438 farms, against 10,241 in 1870; and in Arkansas, with 94,433
farms, against 49,424 in 1870.In Missouri 215,575 farms are reported,
against 148,228 in 1870.In these States, though social changes have
been great, the increase in number of farms has been largely due to new
settlements, as in the States of the far Northwest.But the change in
the older Southern States is of a different character.Virginia, for example, has long been settled, and had 77,000 farms
thirty years ago.But the increase in number within the past ten years
has been 44,668, or 60.5 per cent.Contrasting this with the increase in
New York, a remarkable difference appears.West Virginia had few more
farms ten years ago than New Jersey; now it has nearly twice as many,
and has gained in number nearly 60 per cent.North Carolina, too, has
increased 78 per cent.in number of farms since 1870, and South Carolina
80 per cent.In Georgia the increase has been still greater--from 69,956
to 138,626, or nearly 100 per cent.In Alabama there are 135,864
farms, against 67,382 in 1870, an increase of over 100 per cent.These
proportions, contrasted with those for the older Northern States, reveal
a change that is nothing less than an industrial revolution.But the
force of this tendency to division of estates has been greatest in the
States named.Whereas the ratio of increase in number of farms becomes
greater in Northern States as we go from the East toward the Mississippi
River, at the South it is much smaller in Kentucky, Tennessee,
Mississippi, and Louisiana than in the older States on the Atlantic
coast.Thus in Louisiana the increase has been from 28,481 to 48,292
farms, or 70 per cent., and in Mississippi from 68,023 to 101,772 farms,
or less than 50 per cent., against 100 in Alabama and Georgia.In
Kentucky the increase has been from 118,422 to 166,453 farms, or 40 per
cent., and in Tennessee from 118,141 to 165,650 farms, or 40 per cent.,
against 60 in Virginia and West Virginia, and 78 in North Carolina.Thus, while the tendency to division is far greater than in the Northern
States of corresponding age, it is found in full force only in six of
the older Southern States, Alabama, West Virginia, and four on the
Atlantic coast.In these, the revolution already effected foreshadows
and will almost certainly bring about important political changes within
a few years.In these six States there 310,795 more farm owners or
occupants than there were ten years ago.--_N.Y.*       *       *       *       *




A FARMER'S LIME KILN.For information about burning lime we republish the following article
furnished by a correspondent of the _Country Gentleman_ several years
ago:

[Illustration: Fig.1), Railway Track--B B B,
Iron Rods running through Kiln--C, Capstone over Arch--D, Arch--E, Well
without brick or ash lining.]I send you a description and sketch of a lime-kiln put up on my premises
about five years ago.The dimensions of this kiln are 13 feet square by
25 feet high from foundation, and its capacity 100 bushels in 24 hours.It was constructed of the limestone quarried on the spot.It has round
iron rods (shown in sketch) passing through, with iron plates fastened
to the ends as clamps to make it more firm; the pair nearest the top
should be not less than 2 feet from that point, the others interspersed
about 2 feet apart--the greatest strain being near the top.The arch
should be 7 feet high by 51/2 wide in front, with a gather on the top
and sides of about 1 foot, with plank floor; and if this has a little
incline it will facilitate shoveling the lime when drawn.The arch
should have a strong capstone; also one immediately under the well of
the kiln, with a hole 2 feet in diameter to draw the lime through; or
two may be used with semicircle cut in each.Iron bars 2 inches wide by
1/8 inch thick are used in this kiln for closing it, working in slots
fastened to capstone.These slots must be put in before the caps
are laid.When it is desired to draw lime, these bars may be
pushed laterally in the slots, or drawn out entirely, according to
circumstances; 3 bars will be enough.The slots are made of iron bars
11/2 inches wide, with ends rounded and turned up, and inserted in holes
drilled through capstone and keyed above.The well of the kiln is lined with fire-brick one course thick, with a
stratum of coal ashes three inches thick tamped in between the brick
and wall, which proves a great protection to the wall.About 2,000
fire-bricks were used.The proprietors of this kiln say about one-half
the lower part of the well might have been lined with a first quality of
common brick and saved some expense and been just as good.The form of
the well shown in Fig.3 is 7 feet in diameter in the bilge, exclusive
of the lining of brick and ashes.Experiments in this vicinity have
proved this to be the best, this contraction toward the top being
absolutely necessary, the expansion of the stone by the heat is so
great that the lime cannot be drawn from perpendicular walls, as was
demonstrated in one instance near here, where a kiln was built on that
principle.The kiln, of course, is for coal, and our stone requires
about three-quarters of a ton per 100 bushels of lime, but this, I am
told, varies according to quality, some requiring more than others; the
quantity can best be determined by experimenting; also the regulation of
the heat--if too great it will cause the stones to melt or run together
as it were, or, if too little, they will not be properly burned.The
business requires skill and judgment to run it successfully.This kiln is located at the foot of a steep bluff, the top about level
with the top of the kiln, with railway track built of wooden sleepers,
with light iron bars, running from the bluff to the top of the kiln, and
a hand-car makes it very convenient filling the kiln.Such a location
should be had if possible.Your inquirer may perhaps get some ideas
of the principles of a kiln for using _coal_.The dimensions may be
reduced, if desired.If for _wood_, the arch would have to be formed for
that, and the height of kiln reduced.*       *       *       *       *




THE MANUFACTURE OF APPLE JELLY.[Footnote: From the report of the New York Agricultural Society.]Within the county of Oswego, New York, Dewitt C. Peck reports there are
five apple jelly factories in operation.The failure of the apple crop,
for some singular and unexplained reason, does not extend in great
degree to the natural or ungrafted fruit.Though not so many as common,
even of these apples, there are yet enough to keep these five mills and
the numerous cider mills pretty well employed.The largest jelly factory
is located near the village of Mexico, and as there are some features in
regard to this manufacture peculiar to this establishment which may be
new and interesting, we will undertake a brief description.The factory
is located on the Salmon Creek, which affords the necessary power.A
portion of the main floor, first story, is occupied as a saw mill,
the slabs furnishing fuel for the boiler furnace connected with the
evaporating department.Just above the mill, along the bank of the pond,
and with one end projecting over the water, are arranged eight large
bins, holding from five hundred to one thousand bushels each, into which
the apples are delivered from the teams.The floor in each of these has
a sharp pitch or inclination toward the water and at the lower end is a
grate through which the fruit is discharged, when wanted, into a trough
half submerged in the pond.The preparation of the fruit and extraction of the juice proceeds
as follows: Upon hoisting a gate in the lower end of this trough,
considerable current is caused, and the water carries the fruit a
distance of from thirty to one hundred feet, and passes into the
basement of the mill, where, tumbling down a four-foot perpendicular
fall, into a tank, tight in its lower half and slatted so as to permit
the escape of water and impurities in the upper half, the apples are
thoroughly cleansed from all earthy or extraneous matter.Such is the
friction caused by the concussion of the fall, the rolling and rubbing
of the apples together, and the pouring of the water, that decayed
sections of the fruit are ground off and the rotten pulp passes away
with other impurities.From this tank the apples are hoisted upon an
endless chain elevator, with buckets in the form of a rake-head with
iron teeth, permitting drainage and escape of water, to an upper story
of the mill, whence by gravity they descend to the grater.The press
is wholly of iron, all its motions, even to the turning of the screws,
being actuated by the water power.The cheese is built up with layers
inclosed in strong cotton cloth, which displaces the straw used in olden
time, and serves also to strain the cider.As it is expressed from
the press tank, the cider passes to a storage tank, and thence to the
defecator.This defecator is a copper pan, eleven feet long and about three feet
wide.At each end of this pan is placed a copper tube three inches in
diameter and closed at both ends.Lying between and connecting
these two, are twelve tubes, also of copper, 11/2 inches in diameter,
penetrating the larger tubes at equal distances from their upper and
under surfaces, the smaller being parallel with each other, and 11/2
inches apart.When placed in position, the larger tubes, which act as
manifolds, supplying the smaller with steam, rest upon the bottom of the
pan, and thus the smaller pipes have a space of three-fourths of an inch
underneath their outer surfaces.The cider comes from the storage tank in a continuous stream about
three-eighths of an inch in diameter.Steam is introduced to the large
or manifold tubes, and from them distributed through the smaller ones at
a pressure of from twenty-five to thirty pounds per inch.Trap valves
are provided for the escape of water formed by condensation within the
pipes.The primary object of the defecator is to remove all impurities
and perfectly clarify the liquid passing through it.All portions of
pomace and other minute particles of foreign matter, when heated,
expand and float in the form of scum upon the surface of the cider.An
ingeniously contrived floating rake drags off this scum and delivers it
over the side of the pan.To facilitate this removal, one side of the
pan, commencing at a point just below the surface of the cider, is
curved gently outward and upward, terminating in a slightly inclined
plane, over the edge of which the scum is pushed by the rake into a
trough and carried away.A secondary purpose served by the defecator
is that of reducing the cider by evaporation to a partial sirup of the
specific gravity of about 20 deg.When of this consistency the liquid
is drawn from the bottom and less agitated portion of the defecator by a
siphon, and thence carried to the evaporator, which is located upon the
same framework and just below the defecator.The evaporator consists of a separate system of six copper tubes, each
twelve feet long and three inches in diameter.These are each jacketed
or inclosed in an iron pipe of four inches internal diameter, fitted
with steam-tight collars so as to leave half an inch steam space
surrounding the copper tubes.The latter are open at both ends
permitting the admission and egress of the sirup and the escape of the
steam caused by evaporation therefrom, and are arranged upon the frame
so as to have a very slight inclination downward in the direction of
the current, and each nearly underneath its predecessor in regular
succession.Each is connected by an iron supply pipe, having a steam
gauge or indicator attached, with a large manifold, and that by other
pipes with a steam boiler of thirty horse power capacity.Steam being
let on at from twenty five to thirty pounds pressure, the stream of
sirup is received from the defecator through a strainer, which removes
any impurities possibly remaining into the upper evaporator tube;
passing in a gentle flow through that, it is delivered into a funnel
connected with the next tube below, and so, back and forth, through the
whole system.The sirup enters the evaporator at a consistency of from
20 deg.Baume, and emerges from the last tube some three minutes
later at a consistency of from 30 deg.Baume, which is found on
cooling to be the proper point for perfect jelly.This point is found to
vary one or two degrees, according to the fermentation consequent upon
bruises in handling the fruit, decay of the same, or any little delay in
expressing the juice from the cheese.The least fermentation occasions
the necessity for a lower reduction.To guard against this, no cheese
is allowed to stand over night, no pomace left in the grater or vat, no
cider in the tank; and further to provide against fermentation, a large
water tank is located upon the roof and filled by a force pump, and by
means of hose connected with this, each grater, press, vat, tank, pipe,
trough, or other article of machinery used, can be thoroughly washed and
cleansed.Hot water, instead of cider, is sometimes sent through the
defecator, evaporator, etc., until all are thoroughly scalded and
purified.If the saccharometer shows too great or too little reduction,
the matter is easily regulated by varying the steam pressure in the
evaporator by means of a valve in the supply pipe.If boiled cider
instead of jelly is wanted for making pies, sauces, etc., it is drawn
off from one of the upper evaporator tubes according to the consistency
desired; or can be produced at the end of the process by simply reducing
the steam pressure.As the jelly emerges from the evaporator it is transferred to a tub
holding some fifty gallons, and by mixing a little therein, any little
variations in reduction or in the sweetness or sourness of the fruit
used are equalized.From this it is drawn through faucets, while hot,
into the various packages in which it is shipped to market.A favorite
form of package for family use is a nicely turned little wooden
bucket with cover and bail, two sizes, holding five and ten pounds
respectively.The smaller packages are shipped in cases for convenience
in handling.The present product of this manufactory is from 1,500 to
1,800 pounds of jelly each day of ten hours.It is calculated that
improvements now in progress will increase this to something more than a
ton per day.Each bushel of fruit will produce from four to five pounds
of jelly, fruit ripening late in the season being more productive than
earlier varieties.Crab apples produce the finest jelly; sour, crabbed,
natural fruit makes the best looking article, and a mixture of all
varieties gives most satisfactory results as to flavor and general
quality.As the pomace is shoveled from the finished cheese, it is again ground
under a toothed cylinder, and thence drops into large troughs, through a
succession of which a considerable stream of water is flowing.Here it
is occasionally agitated by raking from the lower to the upper end of
the trough as the current carries it downward, and the apple seeds
becoming disengaged drop to the bottom into still water, while the pulp
floats away upon the stream.A succession of troughs serves to remove
nearly all the seeds.The value of the apple seeds thus saved is
sufficient to pay the daily wages of all the hands employed in the whole
establishment.The apples are measured in the wagon box, one and a half
cubic feet being accounted a bushel.This mill ordinarily employs about six men: One general superintendent,
who buys and measures the apples, keeps time books, attends to all the
accounts and the working details of the mill, and acts as cashier; one
sawyer, who manufactures lumber for the local market and saws the slabs
into short lengths suitable for the furnace; one cider maker, who grinds
the apples and attends the presses; one jelly maker, who attends the
defecator, evaporator, and mixing tub, besides acting as his own fireman
and engineer; one who attends the apple seed troughs and acts as general
helper, and one man-of-all-work to pack, ship and assist whenever
needed.The establishment was erected late in the season of 1880,
and manufactured that year about forty-five tons of jelly, besides
considerable cider exchanged to the farmers for apples, and some boiled
cider.The price paid for apples in 1880, when the crop was superabundant, was
six to eight cents per bushel; in 1881, fifteen cents.The proprietor
hopes next year to consume 100,000 bushels.These institutions are
important to the farmer in that they use much fruit not otherwise
valuable and very perishable.Fruit so crabbed and gnarled as to have no
market value, and even frozen apples, if delivered while yet solid, can
be used.(Such apples are placed in the water while frozen, the water
draws the frost sufficiently to be grated, and passing through the press
and evaporator before there is time for chemical change, they are found
to make very good jelly.They are valuable to the consumer by converting
the perishable, cheap, almost worthless crop of the bearing and abundant
years into such enduring form that its consumption may be carried over
to years of scarcity and furnish healthful food in cheap and pleasant
form to many who would otherwise be deprived; and lastly, they are of
great interest to society, in that they give to cider twice the value
for purposes of food that it has or can have, even to the manufacturer,
for use as a beverage and intoxicant.*       *       *       *       *




IMPROVED GRAPE BAGS.It stands to reason that were our summers warmer we should be able to
grow grapes successfully on open walls; it is therefore probable that
a new grape bag, the invention of M. Pelletier, 20 Rue de la Banque,
Paris, intended to serve a double purpose, viz., protecting the fruit
and hastening its maturity, will, when it becomes known, be welcomed in
this country.It consists of a square of curved glass so fixed to
the bag that the sun's rays are concentrated upon the fruit, thereby
rendering its ripening more certain in addition to improving its quality
generally.The glass is affixed to the bag by means of a light iron wire
support.It covers that portion of it next the sun, so that it increases
the amount of light and warms the grapes without scorching them, a
result due to the convexity of the glass and the layer of air between it
and the bag.M. Pelletier had the idea of rendering these bags cheaper
by employing plain squares instead of curved ones, but the advantage
thus obtained was more than counterbalanced by their comparative
inefficacy.In practice it was found that the curved squares gave an
average of 7 deg.more than the straight ones, while there was a difference
of 10 deg.when the bags alone were used, thus plainly demonstrating the
practical value of the invention.Whether these glass-fronted bags would have much value in the case of
grapes grown under glass in the ordinary way is a question that can only
be determined by actual experiment; but where the vines are on walls,
either under glass screens or in the open air, so that the bunches feel
the full force of the sun's rays, there can be no doubt as to their
utility, and it is probable that by their aid many of the continental
varieties which we do not now attempt to grow in the open, and which are
scarcely worthy of a place under glass, might be well ripened.At
any rate we ought to give anything a fair trial which may serve to
neutralize, if only in a slight degree, the uncertainty of our summers.As it is, we have only about two varieties of grapes, and these not the
best of the hardy kinds, as regards flavor and appearance, that ripen
out of doors, and even these do not always succeed.We know next to
nothing of the many really well-flavored kinds which are so much
appreciated in many parts of the Continent.The fact is, our outdoor
culture of grapes offers a striking contrast to that practiced under
glass, and although our comparatively sunless and moist climate affords
some excuse for our shortcomings in this respect, there is no valid
reason for the utter want of good culture which is to be observed in a
general way.[Illustration: GRAPE BAG.--OPEN.]Given intelligent training, constant care in stopping the laterals, and
checking mildew as well as thinning the berries, allowing each bunch to
get the full benefit of sun and air, and I believe good eatable grapes
would often be obtained even in summers marked by a low average
temperature.[Illustration: GRAPE BAG.--CLOSED.]If, moreover, to a good system of culture we add some such mechanical
contrivance as that under notice whereby the bunches enjoy an average
warmth some 10 deg.higher than they otherwise would do, we not only insure
the grapes coming to perfection in favored districts, but outdoor
culture might probably be practiced in higher latitudes than is now
practicable.[Illustration: CURVED GLASS FOR FRONT OF BAG.]The improved grape bag would also offer great facilities for destroying
mildew or guarantee the grapes against its attacks, as a light dusting
administered as soon as the berries were fairly formed would suffice for
the season, as owing to the glass protecting the berries from driving
rains, which often accompany south or south-west winds in summer and
autumn, the sulphur would not be washed off.[Illustration: CURVED GLASS FIXED ON BAG.]The inventor claims, and we should say with just reason, that these
glass fronted bags would be found equally serviceable for the ripening
of pears and other choice fruits, and with a view to their being
employed for such a purpose, he has had them made of varying sizes and
shapes.In conclusion, it may be observed that, in addition to advancing
the maturity of the fruits to which they are applied, they also serve to
preserve them from falling to the ground when ripe.--J.COBNHILL, _in
the Garden_.*       *       *       *       *




UTILIZATION OF SOLAR HEAT.At a popular fete in the Tuileries Gardens I was struck with an
experiment which seems deserving of the immediate attention of the
English public and military authorities.Among the attractions of the fete was an apparatus for the concentration
and utilization of solar heat, and, though the sun was not very
brilliant, I saw this apparatus set in motion a printing machine which
printed several thousand copies of a specimen newspaper entitled the
_Soleil Journal_.The sun's rays are concentrated in a reflector, which moves at the
same rate as the sun and heats a vertical boiler, setting the motive
steam-engine at work.As may be supposed, the only object was to
demonstrate the possibility of utilizing the concentrated heat of the
solar rays; but I closely examined it, because the apparatus seems
capable of great utility in existing circumstances.Here in France,
indeed, there is a radical drawback--the sun is often overclouded.Thousands of years ago the idea of utilizing the solar rays must have
suggested itself, and there are still savage tribes who know no other
mode of combustion; but the scientific application has hitherto been
lacking.About fifteen years ago
Professor Mouchon, of Tours, began constructing such an apparatus, and
his experiments have been continued by M. Pifre, who has devoted much
labor and expense to realizing M. Mouchou's idea.A company has now come
to his aid, and has constructed a number of apparatus of different sizes
at a factory which might speedily turn out a large number of them.It is
evident that in a country of uninterrupted sunshine the boiler might be
heated in thirty or forty minutes.A portable apparatus could boil two
and one-half quarts an hour, or, say, four gallons a day, thus supplying
by distillation or ebullition six or eight men.The apparatus can be
easily carried on a man's back, and on condition of water, even of the
worst quality, being obtainable, good drinking and cooking water is
insured.M. De Rougaumond, a young scientific writer, has just published
an interesting volume on the invention.I was able yesterday to verify
his statements, for I saw cider made, a pump set in motion, and coffee
made--in short, the calorific action of the sun superseding that of
fuel.The apparatus, no doubt, has not yet reached perfection, but as it
is it would enable the soldier in India or Egypt to procure in the field
good water and to cook his food rapidly.The invention is of especial
importance to England just now, but even when the Egyptian question is
settled the Indian troops might find it of inestimable value.Red tape should for once be disregarded, and a competent commission
forthwith sent to 30 Rue d'Assas, with instructions to report
immediately, for every minute saved may avoid suffering for Englishmen
fighting abroad for their country.I may, of course, be mistaken, but
a commission would decide, and if the apparatus is good the slightest
delay in its adoption would be deplorable.--_Paris Correspondence London

HOW TO ESTABLISH A TRUE MERIDIAN.[Footnote: A paper read before the Engineers' Club of Philadelphia.]By PROFESSOR L. M. HAUPT.The discovery of the magnetic needle was a boon to mankind, and has been
of inestimable service in guiding the mariner through trackless waters,
and the explorer over desert wastes.In these, its legitimate uses, the
needle has not a rival, but all efforts to apply it to the accurate
determination of permanent boundary lines have proven very
unsatisfactory, and have given rise to much litigation, acerbity, and
even death.For these and other cogent reasons, strenuous efforts are being made to
dispense, so far as practicable, with the use of the magnetic needle
in surveying, and to substitute therefor the more accurate method of
traversing from a true meridian.This method, however, involves a
greater degree of preparation and higher qualifications than are
generally possessed, and unless the matter can be so simplified as to be
readily understood, it is unreasonable to expect its general application
in practice.Much has been written upon the various methods of determining, the
true meridian, but it is so intimately related to the determination of
latitude and time, and these latter in turn upon the fixing of a true
meridian, that the novice can find neither beginning nor end.When to
these difficulties are added the corrections for parallax, refraction,
instrumental errors, personal equation, and the determination of the
probable error, he is hopelessly confused, and when he learns that time
may be sidereal, mean solar, local, Greenwich, or Washington, and he is
referred to an ephemeris and table of logarithms for data, he becomes
lost in "confusion worse confounded," and gives up in despair, settling
down to the conviction that the simple method of compass surveying is
the best after all, even if not the most accurate.Having received numerous requests for information upon the subject, I
have thought it expedient to endeavor to prepare a description of the
method of determining the true meridian which should be sufficiently
clear and practical to be generally understood by those desiring to make
use of such information.This will involve an elementary treatment of the subject, beginning with
the


DEFINITIONS.The _celestial sphere_ is that imaginary surface upon which all
celestial objects are projected.The _earth's axis_ is the imaginary line about which it revolves.The _poles_ are the points in which the axis pierces the surface of the
earth, or of the celestial sphere.A _meridian_ is a great circle of the earth cut out by a plane passing
through the axis.All meridians are therefore north and south lines
passing through the poles.From these definitions it follows that if there were a star exactly at
the pole it would only be necessary to set up an instrument and take a
bearing to it for the meridian.Such not being the case, however, we are
obliged to take some one of the near circumpolar stars as our object,
and correct the observation according to its angular distance from the
meridian at the time of observation.For convenience, the bright star known as Ursae Minoris or Polaris, is
generally selected.This star apparently revolves about the north pole,
in an orbit whose mean radius is 1 deg.19' 13",[1] making the revolution in
23 hours 56 minutes.[Footnote 1: This is the codeclination as given in the Nautical Almanac.The mean value decreases by about 20 seconds each year.]During this time it must therefore cross the meridian twice, once above
the pole and once below; the former is called the _upper_, and the
latter the _lower meridian transit or culmination_.It must also pass
through the points farthest east and west from the meridian.The former
is called the _eastern elongation_, the latter the _western_.An observation may he made upon Polaris at any of these four points,
or at any other point of its orbit, but this latter case becomes too
complicated for ordinary practice, and is therefore not considered.If the observation were made upon the star at the time of its upper or
lower culmination, it would give the true meridian at once, but this
involves a knowledge of the true local time of transit, or the longitude
of the place of observation, which is generally an unknown quantity; and
moreover, as the star is then moving east or west, or at right angles to
the place of the meridian, at the rate of 15 deg.of arc in about one hour,
an error of so slight a quantity as only four seconds of time would
introduce an error of one minute of arc.If the observation be made,
however, upon either elongation, when the star is moving up or down,
that is, in the direction of the vertical wire of the instrument, the
error of observation in the angle between it and the pole will be
inappreciable.This is, therefore, the best position upon which to make
the observation, as the precise time of the elongation need not be
given.It can be determined with sufficient accuracy by a glance at the
relative positions of the star Alioth, in the handle of the Dipper,
and Polaris (see Fig.When the line joining these two stars is
horizontal or nearly so, and Alioth is to the _west_ of Polaris, the
latter is at its _eastern_ elongation, and _vice versa_, thus:

[Illustration]

But since the star at either elongation is off the meridian, it will
be necessary to determine the angle at the place of observation to be
turned off on the instrument to bring it into the meridian.This angle,
called the azimuth of the pole star, varies with the latitude of the
observer, as will appear from Fig 2, and hence its value must be
computed for different latitudes, and the surveyor must know his
_latitude_ before he can apply it.Let N be the north pole of the
celestial sphere; S, the position of Polaris at its eastern elongation;
then N S=1 deg.The azimuth of Polaris at the
latitude 40 deg.north is represented by the angle N O S, and that at 60 deg.north, by the angle N O' S, which is greater, being an exterior angle
of the triangle, O S O. From this we see that the azimuth varies at the
latitude.We have first, then, to _find the latitude of the place of observation_.Of the several methods for doing this, we shall select the simplest,
preceding it by a few definitions.A _normal_ line is the one joining the point directly overhead, called
the _zenith_, with the one under foot called the _nadir_.The _celestial horizon_ is the intersection of the celestial sphere by a
plane passing through the center of the earth and perpendicular to the
normal.A _vertical circle_ is one whose plane is perpendicular to the horizon,
hence all such circles must pass through the normal and have the zenith
and nadir points for their poles.The _altitude_ of a celestial object
is its distance above the horizon measured on the arc of a vertical
circle.As the distance from the horizon to the zenith is 90 deg., the
difference, or _complement_ of the altitude, is called the _zenith
distance_, or _co-altitude_.The _azimuth_ of an object is the angle between the vertical plane
through the object and the plane of the meridian, measured on the
horizon, and usually read from the south point, as 0 deg., through west, at
90, north 180 deg., etc., closing on south at 0 deg.These two co-ordinates, the altitude and azimuth, will determine the
position of any object with reference to the observer's place.The
latter's position is usually given by his latitude and longitude
referred to the equator and some standard meridian as co-ordinates.The _latitude_ being the angular distance north or south of the equator,
and the _longitude_ east or west of the assumed meridian.We are now prepared to prove that _the altitude of the pole is equal to
the latitude of the place of observation_.Let H P Z Q1, etc., Fig.2, represent a meridian section of the sphere,
in which P is the north pole and Z the place of observation, then H H1
will be the horizon, Q Q1 the equator, H P will be the altitude of P,
and Q1 Z the latitude of Z. These two arcs are equal, for H C Z = P C
Q1 = 90 deg., and if from these equal quadrants the common angle P C Z be
subtracted, the remainders H C P and Z C Q1, will be equal.To _determine the altitude of the pole_, or, in other words, _the
latitude of the place_.Observe the altitude of the pole star _when on the meridian_, either
above or below the pole, and from this observed altitude corrected for
refraction, subtract the distance of the star from the pole, or its
_polar distance_, if it was an upper transit, or add it if a lower.The result will be the required latitude with sufficient accuracy for
ordinary purposes.The time of the star's being on the meridian can be determined with
sufficient accuracy by a mere inspection of the heavens.The refraction
is _always negative_, and may be taken from the table appended by
looking up the amount set opposite the observed altitude.Thus, if the
observer's altitude should be 40 deg.39' the nearest refraction 01' 07",
should be subtracted from 40 deg.37' 53" for the
latitude.TO FIND THE AZIMUTH OF POLARIS.As we have shown the azimuth of Polaris to be a function of the
latitude, and as the latitude is now known, we may proceed to find the
required azimuth.For this purpose we have a right-angled spherical
triangle, Z S P, Fig.4, in which Z is the place of observation, P the
north pole, and S is Polaris.In this triangle we have given the polar
distance, P S = 10 deg.19' 13"; the angle at S = 90 deg.; and the distance Z
P, being the complement of the latitude as found above, or 90 deg.--L.Substituting these in the formula for the azimuth, we will have sin.of co-latitude, from
which, by assuming different values for the co-latitude, we compute the
following table:

An analysis of this table shows that the azimuth this year (1882)
increases with the latitude from 1 deg.It also shows that the azimuth of Polaris at
any one point of observation decreases slightly from year to year.This
is due to the increase in declination, or decrease in the star's polar
distance.north latitude, this annual decrease in the azimuth
is about 22", while at 50 deg.As the variation in
azimuth for each degree of latitude is small, the table is only computed
for the even numbered degrees; the intermediate values being readily
obtained by interpolation.We see also that an error of a few minutes of
latitude will not affect the result in finding the meridian, e.g., the
azimuth at 40 deg.44'
56", the difference (01' 35") being the correction for one degree of
latitude between 40 deg.Or, in other words, an error of one degree
in finding one's latitude would only introduce an error in the azimuth
of one and a half minutes.With ordinary care the probable error of the
latitude as determined from the method already described need not exceed
a few minutes, making the error in azimuth as laid off on the arc of an
ordinary transit graduated to single minutes, practically zero.REFRACTION TABLE FOR ANY ALTITUDE WITHIN THE LATITUDE OF THE UNITED

APPLICATIONS.In practice to find the true meridian, two observations must be made at
intervals of six hours, or they may be made upon different nights.The
first is for latitude, the second for azimuth at elongation.To make either, the surveyor should provide himself with a good transit
with vertical arc, a bull's eye, or hand lantern, plumb bobs, stakes,
etc.[1] Having "set up" over the point through which it is proposed to
establish the meridian, at a time when the line joining Polaris and
Alioth is nearly vertical, level the telescope by means of the attached
level, which should be in adjustment, set the vernier of the vertical
arc at zero, and take the reading.If the pole star is about making its
_upper_ transit, it will rise gradually until reaching the meridian as
it moves westward, and then as gradually descend.When near the highest
part of its orbit point the telescope at the star, having an assistant
to hold the "bull's eye" so as to reflect enough light down the tube
from the object end to illumine the cross wires but not to obscure the
star, or better, use a perforated silvered reflector, clamp the tube in
this position, and as the star continues to rise keep the _horizontal_
wire upon it by means of the tangent screw until it "rides" along this
wire and finally begins to fall below it.Take the reading of the
vertical arc and the result will be the observed altitude.[Footnote 1: A sextant and artificial horizon may be used to find the
_altitude_ of a star.In this case the observed angle must be divided by
2.]It is a little more accurate to find the altitude by taking the
complement of the observed zenith distance, if the vertical arc has
sufficient range.This is done by pointing first to Polaris when at
its highest (or lowest) point, reading the vertical arc, turning the
horizontal limb half way around, and the telescope over to get another
reading on the star, when the difference of the two readings will be the
_double_ zenith distance, and _half_ of this subtracted from 90 deg.The less the time intervening between these two
pointings, the more accurate the result will be.Having now found the altitude, correct it for refraction by subtracting
from it the amount opposite the observed altitude, as given in the
refraction table, and the result will be the latitude.The observer must
now wait about six hours until the star is at its western elongation,
or may postpone further operations for some subsequent night.In the
meantime he will take from the azimuth table the amount given for his
date and latitude, now determined, and if his observation is to be made
on the western elongation, he may turn it off on his instrument, so
that when moved to zero, _after_ the observation, the telescope will be
brought into the meridian or turned to the right, and a stake set by
means of a lantern or plummet lamp.[Illustration]

It is, of course, unnecessary to make this correction at the time of
observation, for the angle between any terrestrial object and the star
may be read and the correction for the azimuth of the star applied at
the surveyor's convenience.It is always well to check the accuracy of
the work by an observation upon the other elongation before putting in
permanent meridian marks, and care should be taken that they are not
placed near any local attractions.The meridian having been established,
the magnetic variation or declination may readily be found by setting
an instrument on the meridian and noting its bearing as given by the
needle.If, for example, it should be north 5 deg._east_, the variation is
west, because the north end of the needle is _west_ of the meridian, and
_vice versa_._Local time_ may also be readily found by observing the instant when the
sun's center[1] crosses the line, and correcting it for the equation of
time as given above--the result is the true or mean solar time.This,
compared with the clock, will show the error of the latter, and by
taking the difference between the local lime of this and any other
place, the difference of longitude is determined in hours, which can
readily be reduced to degrees by multiplying by fifteen, as 1 h.[Footnote 1: To obtain this time by observation, note the instant of
first contact of the sun's limb, and also of last contact of same, and
take the mean.]APPROXIMATE EQUATION OF TIME._______________________

THE OCELLATED PHEASANT.The collections of the Museum of Natural History of Paris have just been
enriched with a magnificent, perfectly adult specimen of a species of
bird that all the scientific establishments had put down among their
desiderata, and which, for twenty years past, has excited the curiosity
of naturalists.This species, in fact, was known only by a few caudal
feathers, of which even the origin was unknown, and which figured in the
galleries of the Jardin des Plantes under the name of _Argus ocellatus_.This name was given by J. Verreaux, who was then assistant naturalist at
the museum.L. Bonaparte, in his Tableaux
Paralleliques de l'Ordre des Gallinaces, as _Argus giganteus_, and a
few years later it was reproduced by Slater in his Catalogue of the
Phasianidae, and by Gray is his List of the Gallinaceae.But it was not
till 1871 and 1872 that Elliot, in the Annals and Magazine of Natural
History, and in a splendid monograph of the Phasianidae, pointed out
the peculiarities that were presented by the feathers preserved at the
Museum of Paris, and published a figure of them of the natural size.The discovery of an individual whose state of preservation leaves
nothing to be desired now comes to demonstrate the correctness of
Verreaux's, Bonaparte's, and Elliot's suppositions.This bird, whose
tail is furnished with feathers absolutely identical with those that
the museum possessed, is not a peacock, as some have asserted, nor an
ordinary Argus of Malacca, nor an argus of the race that Elliot named
_Argus grayi_, and which inhabits Borneo, but the type of a new genus of
the family Phasianidae.This Gallinacean, in fact, which Mr.Maingonnat
has given up to the Museum of Natural History, has not, like the common
Argus of Borneo, excessively elongated secondaries; and its tail is not
formed of normal rectrices, from the middle of which spring two very
long feathers, a little curved and arranged like a roof; but it consists
of twelve wide plane feathers, regularly tapering, and ornamented with
ocellated spots, arranged along the shaft.Its head is not bare, but is
adorned behind with a tuft of thread-like feathers; and, finally, its
system of coloration and the proportions of the different parts of its
body are not the same as in the common argus of Borneo.There is reason,
then, for placing the bird, under the name of _Rheinardius ocellatus_,
in the family Phasianidae, after the genus _Argus_ which it connects,
after a manner, with the pheasants properly so-called.The specific name
_ocellatus_ has belonged to it since 1871, and must be substituted for
that of _Rheinardi_.The bird measures more than two meters in length, three-fourths of which
belong to the tail.The head, which is relatively small, appears to be
larger than it really is, owing to the development of the piliform tuft
on the occiput, this being capable of erection so as to form a crest
0.05 to 0.06 of a meter in height.The feathers of this crest are
brown and white.The back and sides of the head are covered with downy
feathers of a silky brown and silvery gray, and the front of the neck
with piliform feathers of a ruddy brown.The upper part of the body is
of a blackish tint and the under part of a reddish brown, the whole
dotted with small white or _cafe-au-lait_ spots.Analogous spots are
found on the wings and tail, but on the secondaries these become
elongated, and tear-like in form.On the remiges the markings are quite
regularly hexagonal in shape; and on the upper coverts of the tail
and on the rectrices they are accompanied with numerous ferruginous
blotches, some of which are irregularly scattered over the whole surface
of the vane, while others, marked in the center with a blackish spot,
are disposed in series along the shaft and resemble ocelli.This
similitude of marking between the rectrices and subcaudals renders the
distinction between these two kinds of feathers less sharp than in many
other Gallinaceans, and the more so in that two median rectrices are
considerably elongated and assume exactly the aspect of tail feathers.[Illustration: THE OCELLATED PHEASANT (_Rheinardius ocellatus_).]They are all absolutely plane,
all spread out horizontally, and they go on increasing in length
from the exterior to the middle.They are quite wide at the point of
insertion, increase in diameter at the middle, and afterward taper to
a sharp point.Altogether they form a tail of extraordinary length and
width which the bird holds slightly elevated, so as to cause it to
describe a graceful curve, and the point of which touches the soil.The
beak, whose upper mandible is less arched than that of the pheasants,
exactly resembles that of the arguses.It is slightly inflated at the
base, above the nostrils, and these latter are of an elongated-oval
form.In the bird that I have before me the beak, as well as the feet
and legs, is of a dark rose-color.The legs are quite long and are
destitute of spurs.They terminate in front in three quite delicate
toes, connected at the base by membranes, and behind in a thumb that is
inserted so high that it scarcely touches the ground in walking.This
magnificent bird was captured in a portion of Tonkin as yet unexplored
by Europeans, in a locality named Buih-Dinh, 400 kilometers to the south
of Hue.--_La Nature_.*       *       *       *       *




THE MAIDENHAIR TREE.The Maidenhair tree--Gingkgo biloba--of which we give an illustration,
is not only one of our most ornamental deciduous trees, but one of the
most interesting.Few persons would at first sight take it to be a
Conifer, more especially as it is destitute of resin; nevertheless,
to that group it belongs, being closely allied to the Yew, but
distinguishable by its long-stalked, fan-shaped leaves, with numerous
radiating veins, as in an Adiantum.These leaves, like those of the
larch but unlike most Conifers, are deciduous, turning of a pale yellow
color before they fall.The tree is found in Japan and in China, but
generally in the neighborhood of temples or other buildings, and is, we
believe, unknown in a truly wild state.As in the case of several other
trees planted in like situations, such as Cupressus funebris, Abies
fortunei, A. kaempferi, Cryptomeria japonica, Sciadopitys verticillata,
it is probable that the trees have been introduced from Thibet, or
other unexplored districts, into China and Japan.Though now a solitary
representative of its genus, the Gingkgo was well represented in the
coal period, and also existed through the secondary and tertiary epochs,
Professor Heer having identified kindred specimens belonging to sixty
species and eight genera in fossil remains generally distributed through
the northern hemisphere.Whatever inference we may draw, it is at least
certain that the tree was well represented in former times, if now it
be the last of its race.It was first known to Kaempfer in 1690, and
described by him in 1712, and was introduced into this country in the
middle of the eighteenth century.Loudon relates a curious tale as
to the manner in which a French amateur became possessed of it.The
Frenchman, it appears, came to England, and paid a visit to an English
nurseryman, who was the possessor of five plants, raised from Japanese
seeds.The hospitable Englishman entertained the Frenchman only too
well.He allowed his commercial instincts to be blunted by wine, and
sold to his guest the five plants for the sum of 25 guineas.Next
morning, when time for reflection came, the Englishman attempted to
regain one only of the plants for the same sum that the Frenchman had
given for all five, but without avail.The plants were conveyed to
France, where as each plant had cost about 40 crowns, _ecus_, the tree
got the name of _arbre a quarante ecus_.This is the story as given by
Loudon, who tells us that Andre Thouin used to relate the fact in his
lectures at the Jardin des Plantes, whether as an illustration of the
perfidy of Albion is not stated.The tree is dioecious, bearing male catkins on one plant, female on
another.All the female trees in Europe are believed to have originated
from a tree near Geneva, of which Auguste Pyramus de Candolle secured
grafts, and distributed them throughout the Continent.Nevertheless, the
female tree is rarely met with, as compared with the male; but it is
quite possible that a tree which generally produces male flowers only
may sometimes bear female flowers only.We have no certain evidence of
this in the case of the Gingkgo, but it is a common enough occurrence in
other dioecious plants, and the occurrence of a fruiting specimen near
Philadelphia, as recently recorded by Mr.Meehan, may possibly be
attributed to this cause.The tree of which we give a figure is growing at Broadlands, Hants, and
is about 40 feet in height, with a trunk that measures 7 feet in girth
at 3 feet from the ground, with a spread of branches measuring 45 feet.These dimensions have been considerably exceeded in other cases.In 1837
a tree at Purser's Cross measured 60 feet and more in height.Loudon
himself had a small tree in his garden at Bayswater on which a female
branch was grafted.It is to be feared that this specimen has long since
perished.We have already alluded to its deciduous character, in which it is
allied to the larch.It presents another point of resemblance both to
the larch and the cedar in the short spurs upon which both leaves and
male catkins are borne, but these contracted branches are mingled with
long extension shoots; there seems, however, no regular alternation
between the short and the long shoots, at any rate the _rationale_ of
their production is not understood, though in all probability a little
observation of the growing plant would soon clear the matter up.The fruit is drupaceous, with a soft outer coat and a hard woody shell,
greatly resembling that of a Cycad, both externally and internally.Whether the albumen contains the peculiar "corpuscles" common to Cycads
and Conifers, we do not for certain know, though from the presence of 2
to 3 embryos in one seed, as noted by Endlicher, we presume this is the
case.The interest of these corpuscles, it may be added, lies in the
proof of affinity they offer between Conifers and the higher Cryptogams,
such as ferns and lycopods--an affinity shown also in the peculiar
venation of the Gingkgo.Conifers are in some degree links between
ordinary flowering plants and the higher Cryptogams, and serve to
connect in genealogical sequence groups once considered quite distinct.In germination the two fleshy cotyledons of the Gingkgo remain within
the shell, leaving the three-sided plumule to pass upward; the young
stem bears its leaves in threes.We have no desire to enter further upon the botanical peculiarities of
this tree; enough if we have indicated in what its peculiar interest
consists.We have only to add that in gardens varieties exist some with
leaves more deeply cut than usual, others with leaves nearly entire, and
others with leaves of a golden-yellow color.--_Gardeners' Chronicle_.[Illustration: THE MAIDENHAIR TREE IN THE GARDENS AT BROADLANDS.]*       *       *       *       *




THE WOODS OF AMERICA.A collection of woods without a parallel in the world is now being
prepared for exhibition by the Directors of the American Museum of
Natural History.Scattered about the third floor of the Arsenal, in
Central Park, lie 394 logs, some carefully wrapped in bagging,
some inclosed in rough wooden cases, and others partially sawn
longitudinally, horizontally, and diagonally.These logs represent all
but 26 of the varieties of trees indigenous to this country, and
nearly all have a greater or less economic or commercial value.The 26
varieties needed to complete the collection will arrive before winter
sets in, a number of specimens being now on their way to this city from
the groves of California.S. D. Dill and a number of assistants are
engaged in preparing the specimens for exhibition.The logs as they
reach the workroom are wrapped in bagging and inclosed in cases, this
method being used so that the bark, with its growth of lichens and
delicate exfoliations, shall not be injured while the logs are in
process of transportation from various parts of the country to this
city.The logs are each 6 feet in length, and each is the most perfect
specimen of its class that could be found by the experts employed in
making the collection.With the specimens of the trees come to the
museum also specimens of the foliage and the fruits and flowers of the
tree.These come from all parts of the Union--from Alaska on the north
to Texas on the south, from Maine on the east to California on the
west--and there is not a State or Territory in the Union which has not a
representative in this collection of logs.On arrival here the logs are
green, and the first thing in the way of treatment after their arrival
is to season them, a work requiring great care to prevent them from
"checking," as it is technically called, or "season cracking," as the
unscientific term the splitting of the wood in radiating lines during
the seasoning process.As is well known, the sap-wood of a tree seasons
much more quickly than does the heart of the wood.The prevention of
this splitting is very necessary in preparing these specimens for
exhibition, for when once the wood has split its value for dressing for
exhibition is gone.A new plan to prevent this destruction of specimens
is now being tried with some success under the direction of Prof.Into the base of the log and
alongside the heart a deep hole is bored with an auger.As the wood
seasons this hole permits of a pressure inward and so has in many
instances doubtless saved valuable specimens.One of the finest in the
collection, a specimen of the persimmon tree, some two feet in diameter,
has been ruined by the seasoning process.On one side there is a huge
crack, extending from the top to the bottom of the log, which looks as
though some amateur woodman had attempted to split it with an ax and
had made a poor job of it.The great shrinking of the sap-wood of the
persimmon tree makes the wood of but trifling value commercially.It also has a discouraging effect upon collectors, as it is next to
impossible to cure a specimen, so that all but this one characteristic
of the wood can be shown to the public in a perfect form.Before the logs become thoroughly seasoned, or their lines of growth at
all obliterated, a diagram of each is made, showing in accordance with
a regular scale the thickness of the bark, the sap-wood, and the heart.There is also in this diagram a scale showing the growth of the tree
during each year of its life, these yearly growths being regularly
marked about the heart of the tree by move or less regular concentric
circles, the width of which grows smaller and smaller as the tree grows
older.In this connection attention may be called to a specimen in the
collection which is considered one of the most remarkable in the world.It is not a native wood, but an importation, and the tree from which
this wonderful slab is cut is commonly known as the "Pride of India."The heart of this particular tree was on the port side, and between it
and the bark there is very little sap-wood, not more than an inch.On the starbord side, so to speak, the sap-wood has grown out in an
abnormal manner, and one of the lines indicative of a year's growth is
one and seven-eighths inches in width, the widest growth, many experts
who have seen the specimen say, that was ever recorded.The diagrams
referred to are to be kept for scientific uses, and the scheme of
exhibition includes these diagrams as a part of the whole.After a log has become seasoned it is carefully sawed through the center
down about one-third of its length.A transverse cut is then made and
the semi-cylindrical section thus severed from the log is removed.The
upper end is then beveled.When a log is thus treated the inspector can
see the lower two-thirds presenting exactly the same appearance it did
when growing in the forest.The horizontal cut, through the sap-wood
and to the center of the heart, shows the life lines of the tree, and
carefully planed as are this portion, the perpendicular and the beveled
sections, the grain of the wood can thus be plainly seen.That these may
be made even more valuable to the architect and artisan, the right half
of this planed surface will be carefully polished, and the left half
left in the natural state.This portion of the scheme of treatment is
entirely in the interests of architects and artisans, and it is expected
by Prof.Bickmore that it will be the means of securing for some kinds
of trees, essentially of American growth, and which have been virtually
neglected, an important place in architecture and in ornamental
wood-work, and so give a commercial value to woods that are now of
comparatively little value.Among the many curious specimens in the collection now being prepared
for exhibition, one which will excite the greatest curiosity is a
specimen of the honey locust, which was brought here from Missouri.The bark is covered with a growth of thorns from one to four inches
in length, sharp as needles, and growing at irregular intervals.The
specimen arrived here in perfect condition, but, in order that it might
be transported without injury, it had to be suspended from the roof of
a box car, and thus make its trip from Southern Missouri to this city
without change.Another strange specimen in the novel collection is a
portion of the Yucca tree, an abnormal growth of the lily family.The
trunk, about 2 feet in diameter, is a spongy mass, not susceptible of
treatment to which the other specimens are subjected.Its bark is an
irregular stringy, knotted mass, with porcupine-quill-like leaves
springing out in place of the limbs that grow from all well-regulated
trees.One specimen of the yucca was sent to the museum two years ago,
and though the roots and top of the tree were sawn off, shoots sprang
out, and a number of the handsome flowers appeared.The tree was
supposed to be dead and thoroughly seasoned by this Fall, but now, when
the workmen are ready to prepare it for exhibition, it has shown new
life, new shoots have appeared, and two tufts of green now decorate the
otherwise dry and withered log, and the yucca promises to bloom again
before the winter is over.One of the most perfect specimens of the
Douglass spruce ever seen is in the collection, and is a decided
curiosity.It is a recent arrival from the Rocky Mountains.Its bark,
two inches or more in thickness, is perforated with holes reaching to
the-sap-wood.Many of these contain acorns, or the remains of acorns,
which have been stored there by provident woodpeckers, who dug the holes
in the bark and there stored their winter supply of food.The oldest
specimen in the collection is a section of the _Picea engelmanni_, a
species of spruce growing in the Rocky Mountains at a considerable
elevation above the sea.The specimen is 24 inches in diameter, and the
concentric circles show its age to be 410 years.The wood much resembles
the black spruce, and is the most valuable of the Rocky Mountain
growths.A specimen of the nut pine, whose nuts are used for food by the
Indians, is only 15 inches in diameter, and yet its life lines show its
age to be 369 years.The largest specimen yet received is a section of
the white ash, which is 46 inches in diameter and 182 years old.The
next largest specimen is a section of the _Platanus occidentalis_,
variously known in commerce as the sycamore, button-wood, or plane tree,
which is 42 inches in diameter and only 171 years of age.Specimens of
the redwood tree of California are now on their way to this city from
the Yosemite Valley.One specimen, though a small one, measures 5 feet
in diameter and shows the character of the wood.A specimen of
the enormous growths of this tree was not secured because of the
impossibility of transportation and the fact that there would be no room
in the museum for the storage of such a specimen, for the diameter of
the largest tree of the class is 45 feet and 8 inches, which represents
a circumference of about 110 feet.Then, too, the Californians object to
have the giant trees cut down for commercial, scientific, or any other
purposes.To accompany these specimens of the woods of America, Mr.Morris K.
Jesup, who has paid all the expense incurred in the collection of
specimens, is having prepared as an accompanying portion of the
exhibition water color drawings representing the actual size, color,
and appearance of the fruit, foliage, and flowers of the various trees.Their commercial products, as far as they can be obtained, will also be
exhibited, as, for instance, in the case of the long-leaved pine, the
tar, resin, and pitch, for which it is especially valued.Then, too, in
an herbarium the fruits, leaves, and flowers are preserved as nearly as
possible in their natural state.When the collection is ready for public
view next spring it will be not only the largest, but the only complete
one of its kind in the country.There is nothing like it in the world,
as far as is known; certainly not in the royal museums of England,
France, or Germany.Aside from the value of the collection, in a scientific way, it is
proposed to make it an adjunct to our educational system, which requires
that teachers shall instruct pupils as to the materials used for food
and clothing.The completeness of the exhibition will be of great
assistance also to landscape gardeners, as it will enable them to lay
out private and public parks so that the most striking effects of
foliage may be secured.The beauty of these effects can best be seen in
this country in our own Central Park, where there are more different
varieties and more combinations for foliage effects than in any other
area in the United States.To ascertain how these effects are obtained
one now has to go to much trouble to learn the names of the trees.With
this exhibition such information can be had merely by observation, for
the botanical and common names of each specimen will be attached to
it.It will also be of practical use in teaching the forester how to
cultivate trees as he would other crops.The rapid disappearance of
many valuable forest trees, with the increase in demand and decrease in
supply, will tend to make the collection valuable as a curiosity in
the not far distant future as representing the extinct trees of the
country.--_N.Y.*       *       *       *       *

Hyphenation is inconsistent.In view of the Roman context, the word "virtus" was left in place in
a speech by Manlius in Act III, although it may be a misprint for
"virtue"."He chose a high ball the
first time--so it's been a high ball ever since."Elaine sat down on the couch and put her arm about Davila."But we shall be good friends, better
friends than ever, Davila, when you come to Northumberland to live.""That is just the question, Elaine," was the quick answer; "whether I
shall be given the opportunity, and whether I shall take it, if I am.I
haven't let it go so far, because I don't feel sure of him.Until I do,
I intend to keep tight hold on myself."Just before luncheon, Macloud arrived."I'm glad to see
you here.""Yes, I'm here, thanks to you," said Elaine--and Davila not being
present, she kissed him."No--but I wish the other--would, too!""You're not wont to be so timid," she returned."I wish I had some of your bravery," he said."Isn't it impetuous womanliness."There isn't a doubt as to his feelings.""But there is a doubt as to his letting them control--I see."And you alone can help him solve it--if any one can.And I have
great hopes, Elaine, great hopes!""How any chap could resist you is inconceivable--I could not.""You could not at one time, you mean.""You gave me no encouragement,--so I must, perforce, fare elsewhere.""How many love affairs have you come down here to settle?""By the way, Croyden is impatient to come over this afternoon.The
guest in the trap with Miss Carrington has aroused his curiosity.He
could see only a long brown coat and a brown hat, but the muff before
your face, and his imagination, did the rest."It's simply the country town beginning to tell
on him.He is curious about new guests, and Miss Carrington hadn't
mentioned your coming!He suggested, in a vague sort of way, that there
was something familiar about you, but he didn't attempt to
particularize."I think not--we shall all be present.""And _how_ shall you meet him?""I reckon you don't know much about it--haven't any plans?"He will know why I'm
here, and whether he is glad or sorry or displeased at my coming, I
shall know instantly.It's absurd, this
notion of his, and why let it rule him and me!I've always got what I
wanted, and I'm going to get Geoffrey.A Queen of a Nation must propose
to a suitor, so why not a Queen of Money to a man less rich than
she--especially when she is convinced that that alone keeps them apart.I shall give him a chance to propose to me first; several chances,
indeed!""Then, if he doesn't respond--I shall do it
myself."XVII

A HANDKERCHIEF AND A GLOVE


Miss Cavendish was standing behind the curtains in the window of her
room, when Croyden and Macloud came up the walk, at four o'clock.She was waiting!--not another touch to be given to her attire.Her
gown, of shimmering blue silk, clung to her figure with every movement,
and fell to the floor in suggestively revealing folds.Her dark hair
was arranged in simple fashion--the simplicity of exquisite
taste--making the fair face below it, seem fairer even than it was.She heard them enter the lower hall, and pass into the drawing-room.She glided out to the stairway, and stood, peering down over the
balustrade.She heard Miss Carrington's greeting and theirs--heard
Macloud's chuckle, and Croyden's quiet laugh.Then she heard Macloud
say:

"Mr.Croyden is anxious to meet your guest--at least, we took her to be
a guest you were driving with this morning.""My guest is equally anxious to meet Mr.Croyden," Miss Carrington
replied."Did you ever know a woman to be ready?"Croyden imagined there was something familiar about her," Macloud
remarked.(Elaine strained her ears to catch his answer.)"She didn't let me have the chance to recognize her," said he--"she
wouldn't let me see her face."(Elaine gave a little sigh of relief.)"She couldn't have covered it completely--she saw you.""She can't--I'm on the pinnacle of expectation, now.""Humpty-Dumpty risks a great fall!""If the guest doesn't please me, I'm going
to talk to Miss Carrington.""You're growing blase," she warned."If it is, I know one who must
be too blase even to move," with a meaning glance at Macloud.A light foot-fall on the stairs, the soft swish of skirts in the
hallway, Croyden turned, expectantly--and Miss Cavendish entered the
room.Croyden's from astonishment; the
others' with watching him.Elaine's eyes were intent on Croyden's face--and what she saw there
gave her great content: he might not be persuaded, but he loved her,
and he would not misunderstand.Her face brightened with a fascinating
smile."You are surprised to see me, messieurs?"Croyden's eyes turned quickly to his friend, and back again."I'm not so sure as to Monsieur Macloud," he said."Surprised is quite too light a word--stunned would but meekly express
it.""Did neither of you ever hear me mention Miss Carrington?--We were
friends, almost chums, at Dobbs Ferry.""If I did, it has escaped me?""Well, you're likely not to forget it again.""Did you know that I--that we were here?"I knew that you and Colin were both here," Elaine replied,
imperturbably."Do you think yourself so unimportant as not to be
mentioned by Miss Carrington?""What will you have to drink, Mr.she asked--while Elaine and Macloud
laughed."You said you would take a _sour_ ball."A man who mixes a
high ball with a sour ball is either rattled or drunk, I am not the
latter, therefore----"

"You mean that my coming has rattled you?""Yes--I'm rattled for very joy.""You could spare a few--and not miss them!"said Macloud, handing him the glass."Sweetened by your touch, I suppose!"By the ladies' presence--God save them!""Colin," said Croyden, as, an hour later, they walked back to
Clarendon, "you should have told me.""Don't affect ignorance, old man--you knew Elaine was coming.""And that it was she in the trap.""The muff hid her face from me, too.""Do you think it was wise to let her come?""I had nothing to do with her decision.Miss Carrington asked her, she
accepted.""Didn't you give her my address?"Croyden looked at him, doubtfully."I'm telling you the truth," said Macloud."She tried to get your
address, when I was last in Northumberland, and I refused.""And then, she stumbles on it through Davila Carrington!I reckon, if I went off into some deserted spot in Africa, it
wouldn't be a month until some fellow I knew, or who knows a mutual
friend, would come nosing around, and blow on me."I'm not sorry she came--at least, not now, since she's here.--I'll
be sorry enough when she goes, however.""I must--it's the only proper thing to do.""Would it not be better that _she_ should decide what is proper for
her?""Based on your peculiar notion of relative wealth between husband and
wife--without regard to what she may think on the subject.In other
words, have you any right to decline the risk, if she is willing to
undertake it?"Her income, for three
months, about equals my entire fortune.""And live at the rate of pretty near two hundred thousand dollars a
year?""I think I could, if I loved the girl.""And suffer in your self-respect forever after?"If you
play _your_ part, you won't lose your self-respect.""It is a trifle difficult to do--to play my part, when all the world is
saying, 'he married her for her money,' and shows me scant regard in
consequence.""Why the devil need you care what the world says!""I don't--the world may go hang.But the question is, how long can the
man retain the woman's esteem, with such a handicap.""It depends entirely on yourself.--If you start with it, you can hold
it, if you take the trouble to try."Croyden laughed, as they entered
Clarendon."Just what I should like to know----"

"Well, I'll tell you what you are if you don't marry Elaine Cavendish,"
Macloud interrupted--"You're an unmitigated fool!""Assuming that Miss Cavendish would marry me.""You're not likely to marry her, otherwise," retorted Macloud, as he
went up the stairs.On the landing he halted and looked down at Croyden
in the hall below."And if you don't take your chance, the chance she
has deliberately offered you by coming to Hampton, you are worse
than----" and, with an expressive gesture, he resumed the ascent."How do you know she came down here just for that purpose?"But all that came back in answer, as Macloud went down the hall and
into his room, was the whistled air from a popular opera, then running
in the Metropolis."Ev'ry little movement has a meaning all its own,
          Ev'ry thought and action----"

The door slammed--the music ceased."I won't believe it," Croyden reflected, "that Elaine would do anything
so utterly unconventional as to seek me out deliberately.... I might
have had a chance if--Oh, damn it all!why didn't we find the old
pirate's box--it would have clarified the whole situation."As he changed into his evening clothes, he went over the matter,
carefully, and laid out the line of conduct that he intended to
follow.He would that Elaine had stayed away from Hampton.It was putting him
to too severe a test--to be with her, to be subject to her alluring
loveliness, and, yet, to be unmoved.It is hard to see the luscious
fruit within one's reach and to refrain from even touching it.It grew
harder the more he contemplated it....

"It's no use fighting against it, here!"he exclaimed, going into
Macloud's room, and throwing himself on a chair."I'm going to cut the
whole thing."Macloud inquired, pausing with
his waistcoat half on."What the devil do you think I'm talking about?""Not being a success at solving riddles, I give it up.""Can you comprehend this:--I'm going to
leave town?""He is coming to it, at last," he thought.What he said was:--"You're
not going to be put to flight by a woman?""I am.--If I stay here I shall lose.""Most people would not call that _losing_," said Macloud."I have nothing to do with most people--only, with myself.""It seems so!--even Elaine isn't to be considered.""Haven't we gone over all that?""I don't know--but, if we have, go over it again.""You assume she came down here solely on my account--because I'm
here?""I assume nothing," Macloud answered, with a quiet chuckle."I said you
have a chance, and urged you not to let it slip.I should not have
offered any suggestion--I admit that----"

"Oh, bosh!""Don't be so humble--you're rather
proud of your interference."I'm only sorry it is so unavailing.""You did!--or, at least, I inferred as much.""I'm not responsible for your inferences."Nothing!--not even for my resolution--I haven't any--I can't
make any that holds.Desire clamors for me to stay--to hasten over to Ashburton--to
put it to the test.When I get to Ashburton, common sense will be in
control.When I come away, desire will tug me back, again--and so on,
and so on--and so on.""You need a cock-tail, instead
of a weather-cock.if we are to dine at the Carringtons' at
seven, we would better be moving.Having thrown the blue funk, usual to
a man in your position, you'll now settle down to business.""Let future events determine--take it as it comes," Macloud urged."If I let future events
decide for me, the end's already fixed."The big clock on the landing was chiming seven when they rang the bell
at Ashburton and the maid ushered them into the drawing-room.Carrington was out of town, visiting in an adjoining county, and the
Captain had not appeared.He came down stairs a moment later, and took
Macloud and Croyden over to the library.After about a quarter of an hour, he glanced at his watch a trifle
impatiently.--Another fifteen minutes, and he glanced at it again.he called, as the maid passed the door."Go up to Miss
Davila's room and tell her it's half-after-seven."Then he continued with the story he was relating.Presently, the maid returned; the Captain looked at her,
interrogatingly."Mis' Davila, she ain' deah, no seh," said the girl."She is probably in Miss Cavendish's room,--look, there, for her," the
Captain directed.I looks dyar--she ain' no place up stairs, and neither is
Mis' Cav'dish, seh.Hit's all dark, in dey rooms, seh, all dark.""Half-after-seven, and not here?""They were here, two hours ago," said Croyden."Find out from the other servants whether they left any word."excuse me, sirs, I'll try to locate them."He went to the telephone, and called up the Lashiels, the Tilghmans,
the Tayloes, and all their neighbors and intimates, only to receive the
same answer: "They were not there, and hadn't been there that
afternoon.""We are at your service, Captain Carrington," said Macloud
instantly.--"At your service for anything we can do.""They knew, of course, you were expected for dinner?"he asked, as he
led the way upstairs.--"I can't account for it."The Captain inspected his granddaughter's and Miss Cavendish's rooms,
Macloud and Croyden, being discreet, the rooms on the other side of the
house."We will have dinner," said the Captain."They will surely turn up
before we have finished."The dinner ended, however, and the missing ones had not returned."Might they have gone for a drive?""The keys of the stable are on my desk,
which shows that the horses are in for the night.I admit I am at a
loss--however, I reckon they will be in presently, with an explanation
and a good laugh at us for being anxious."But when nine o'clock came, and then half-after-nine, and still they
did not appear, the men grew seriously alarmed.The Captain had recourse to the telephone again, getting residence
after residence, without result."I don't know what to make of it," he said, bewildered."I've called
every place I can think of, and I can't locate them."Let us see how the matter stands," said Macloud."We left them here
about half-after-five, and, so far as can be ascertained, no one has
seen them since.Consequently, they must have gone out for a walk or a
drive.A drive is most unlikely, at this time of the day--it is dark
and cold.Furthermore, your horses are in the stable, so, if they went,
they didn't go alone--some one drove them.The alternative--a walk--is
the probable explanation; and that remits us to an accident as the
cause of delay.Which, it seems to me, is the likely explanation.""But if there were an accident, they would have been discovered, long
since; the walks are not deserted," the Captain objected."Possibly, they went out of the town.""A young woman never goes out of town, unescorted," was the decisive
answer."This is a Southern town, you know.""I suppose you don't care to telephone the police?""No--not yet," the Captain replied."Davila would never forgive me, if
nothing really were wrong--besides, I couldn't.The Mayor's office is
closed for the night--we're not supposed to need the police after six
o'clock.""Then Croyden and I will patrol the roads, hereabout," said Macloud.I will go out the Queen Street pike a mile or two," the Captain
said.Croyden can take the King Street pike, North and
South.We'll meet here not later than eleven o'clock.Excuse me a
moment----"

"What do you make of it?""It is either very serious or else it's nothing at all.I mean, if
anything _has_ happened, it's far out of the ordinary," Croyden
answered."Exactly my idea--though, I confess, I haven't a notion what the
serious side could be.It's safe to assume that they didn't go into the
country--the hour, alone, would have deterred them, even if the danger
from the <DW64> were not present, constantly, in Miss Carrington's mind.On the other hand, how could anything have happened in the town which
would prevent one of them from telephoning, or sending a message, or
getting some sort of word to the Captain.""It's all very mysterious--yet, I dare say, easy of solution and
explanation.There isn't any danger of the one thing that is really
terrifying, so I'm not inclined to be alarmed, unduly--just
disquieted."take these," he said, giving each a revolver."Let us hope there
won't be any occasion to use them, but it is well to be prepared."They went out together--at the intersection of Queen and King Streets,
they parted.eleven o'clock at my house," said the Captain."If any one
of us isn't there, the other two will know he needs assistance."It was a chilly November night, with
frost in the air.The moon, in its second quarter and about to sink
into the waters of the Bay, gave light sufficient to make walking easy,
where the useless street lamps did not kill it with their timid
brilliancy.He passed the limits of the town, and struck out into the
country.It had just struck ten, when they parted--he would walk for
half an hour, and then return.He could do three miles--a mile and a
half each way--and still be at the Carrington house by eleven.He
proceeded along the east side of the road, his eyes busy lest, in the
uncertain light, he miss anything which might serve as a clue.For the
allotted time, he searched but found nothing--he must return.He
crossed to the west side of the road, and faced homeward.A mile passed--a quarter more was added--the feeble lights of the town
were gleaming dimly in the fore, when, beside the track, he noticed a
small white object.It was a woman's handkerchief, and, as he picked it up, a faint odor of
violets was clinging to it still.Here might be a clue--there was a
monogram on the corner, but he could not distinguish it, in the
darkness.He put it in his pocket and hastened on.A hundred feet
farther, and his foot hit something soft.He groped about, with his
hands, and found--a woman's glove.It, also, bore the odor of violets.At the first lamp-post, he stopped and examined the handkerchief--the
monogram was plain: E.C.--and violets, he remembered, were her
favorite perfume.He took out the glove--a soft, undressed kid
affair--but there was no mark on it to help him.He pushed the feminine trifles back
into his pocket, and hurried on.He was late, and when he arrived at Ashburton, Captain Carrington and
Macloud were just about to start in pursuit.he said, tossing the glove and the handkerchief on the
table--"on the west side of the road, about half a mile from town.""The violets are familiar--and the handkerchief is Elaine's," said he."I'm going to call in our friends," he said.XVIII

THE LONE HOUSE BY THE BAY


When Croyden and Macloud left the Carrington residence that evening,
after their call and tea, Elaine and Davila remained for a little while
in the drawing-room rehearsing the events of the day, as women will.Presently, Davila went over to draw the shades."What do you say to a walk before we dress for dinner?""I should like it, immensely," Elaine answered.They went upstairs, changed quickly to street attire, and set out."We will go down to the centre of the town and back," said Davila."It's about half a mile each way, and there isn't any danger, so long
as you keep in the town.I shouldn't venture beyond it unescorted,
however, even in daylight."It's the curse that hangs over the South
since the Civil War: the <DW64>.""I don't mean that all black men are bad, for they are not.Many are
entirely trustworthy, but the trustworthy ones are much, very much, in
the minority.The vast majority are worthless--and a worthless <DW65>
is the worst thing on earth.""I think I prefer only the lighted streets," Elaine remarked."And you will be perfectly safe there," Davila replied.They swung briskly along to the centre of the town--where the two main
thoroughfares, King and Queen Streets, met each other in a wide circle
that, after the fashion of Southern towns, was known, incongruously
enough, as "The Diamond."Passing around this circle, they retraced
their steps toward home.As they neared Ashburton, an automobile with the top up and side
curtains on shot up behind them, hesitated a moment, as though
uncertain of its destination and then drew up before the Carrington
place.Two men alighted, gave an order to the driver, and went across
the pavement to the gate, while the engine throbbed, softly.Then they seemed to notice the women approaching, and stepping back
from the gate, they waited.said one, raising his hat and bowing, "can you
tell me if this is where Captain Carrington lives?"said the man, standing aside to let them pass."I am Miss Carrington--whom do you wish to see?""Captain Carrington, is he at home?""I do not know--if you will come in, I'll inquire."Davila thanked him with a smile,
and she and Elaine went in, leaving the strangers to follow.The next instant, each girl was struggling in the folds of a shawl,
which had been flung over her from behind and wrapped securely around
her head and arms, smothering her cries to a mere whisper.In a trice,
despite their struggles--which, with heads covered and arms held close
to their sides, were utterly unavailing--they were caught up, tossed
into the tonneau, and the car shot swiftly away.In a moment, it was clear of the town, the driver "opened her up," and
they sped through the country at thirty miles an hour."Better give them some air," said the leader."It doesn't matter how
much they yell here."He had been holding Elaine on his lap, his arms keeping the shawl tight
around her.Now he loosed her, and unwound the folds."You will please pardon the liberty we have taken," he said, as he
freed her, "but there are----"

Crack!Elaine had struck him straight in the face with all her strength, and,
springing free, was on the point of leaping out, when he seized her
and forced her back, caught her arms in the shawl, which was still
around her, and bound them tight to her side."I got an upper cut on the
jaw that made me see stars.""I've been very easy with mine," his companion returned.However, he took care not to loosen the shawl from her
arms."There you are, my lady, I hope you've not been greatly
inconvenienced.""Don't forget, Bill!--mum's the word!""At least, you can permit us to sit on the floor of the car," said
Elaine."Whatever may be your scheme, it's scarcely necessary to hold
us in this disgusting position.""I reckon that is a trifle overstated!""What about you,
Miss Carrington?"Davila did not answer--contenting herself with a look, which was far
more expressive than words."Well, we will take pleasure in honoring your first request, Miss
Cavendish."He caught up a piece of rope, passed it around her arms, outside the
shawl, tied it in a running knot, and quietly lifted her from his lap
to the floor."Do you, Miss Carrington, wish to sit beside your
friend?"He took the rope and tied her, likewise.he said, and they placed her beside Elaine."If you will permit your legs to be tied, we will gladly let you have
the seat----"

"No!----"

"Well, I didn't think you would--so you will have to remain on the
floor; you see, you might be tempted to jump, if we gave you the
seat."They were running so rapidly, through the night air, that the country
could scarcely be distinguished, as it rushed by them.To Elaine, it
was an unknown land.Davila, however, was looking for something she
could recognize--some building that she knew, some stream, some
topographical formation.But in the faint and uncertain moonlight,
coupled with the speed at which they travelled, she was baffled.he said, and taking two handkerchiefs from his
pocket, he bound the eyes of both."It is only for a short while," he explained--"matter of an hour or
so, and you suffer no particular inconvenience, I trust."Neither Elaine nor Davila condescended to reply.After a moment's pause, the man went on:

"I neglected to say--and I apologize for my remissness--that you need
fear no ill-treatment.You will be shown every consideration--barring
freedom, of course--and all your wants, within the facilities at our
command, will be gratified.Naturally, however, you will not be
permitted to communicate with your friends.""But I should be better pleased if you
would tell us the reason for this abduction.""That, I regret, I am not at liberty to discuss.""And if it is not acceded to?""In that event--it would be necessary to decide what should be done
with you.""Nothing!--the time hasn't come to imply--I hope it will not come.""Do you mean that your failure would imperil our lives?""Is it possible you mean to threaten our lives?""But you will threaten,
if----"

"Exactly!if--you are at liberty to guess the rest.""Do you appreciate that the
whole Eastern Shore will be searching for us by morning--and that, if
the least indignity is offered us, your lives won't be worth a penny?""We take the risk, Miss Carrington," replied the man, placidly.Davila shrugged her shoulders, and they rode in silence, for half an
hour.Then the speed of the car slackened, they ran slowly for half a mile,
and stopped.The chief reached down, untied the handkerchiefs, and
sprang out."You may descend," he said, offering his hand.Elaine saw the hand, and ignored it; Davila refused even to see the
hand.They could make out, in the dim light, that they were before a long,
low, frame building, with the waters of the Bay just beyond.A light
burned within, and, as they entered, the odor of cooking greeted them."I
suppose it's scarcely proper in an abducted maiden, but I'm positively
famished.""I'm too enraged to eat," said Davila."Afraid?--not in the least!""No more am I--but oughtn't we be afraid?"They had been halted on the porch, while the chief went in, presumably,
to see that all was ready for their reception."If you will come in," he said, "I will show you to your apartment.""Prison, you mean," said Davila."Apartment is a little better word, don't you think?""However, as you wish, Miss Carrington, as you wish!We shall try to
make you comfortable, whatever you may call your temporary
quarters.--These two rooms are yours," he continued, throwing open the
door."They are small, but quiet and retired; you will not, I am sure,
be disturbed.Pardon me, if I remove these ropes, you will be less
hampered in your movements.supper will be served in fifteen
minutes--you will be ready?""Yes, we shall be ready," said Elaine, and the man bowed and retired."They might be worse," Davila retorted."Yes!--and we best be thankful for it.""The rooms aren't so bad," said Elaine, looking around."We each have a bed, and a bureau, and a wash-stand, and a couple of
chairs, a few chromos, a rug on the floor--and bars at the window.""I noticed the bars," said Davila."They've provided us with water, so we may as well use it," she said."I think my face needs--Heavens!"Haven't you observed the same sight in me?""I've lost
all my puffs, I know--and so have you--and your hat is a trifle awry.""Since we're not trying to make an impression, I reckon it doesn't
matter!""We will have ample opportunity to put them to
rights before Colin and Geoffrey see us."She took off her hat, pressed her hair into shape, replaced a few pins,
dashed water on her face, and washed her hands."Now," she said, going into the other room where Miss Carrington was
doing likewise, "if I only had a powder-rag, I'd feel dressed."Davila turned, and, taking a little book, from the pocket of her coat,
extended it."Here is some Papier Poudre," she said.Elaine exclaimed, and, tearing out a sheet, she
rubbed it over her face.A door opened and a young girl appeared, wearing apron and cap.said Elaine as she saw the table, with its candles and
silver (plated, to be sure), dainty china, and pressed glass."If the food is in keeping, I think we can get along for a few days.We
may as well enjoy it while it lasts.""You always were of a philosophic mind."She might have added, that it was the only way she knew--her wealth
having made all roads easy to her.The meal finished, they went back to their apartment, to find the bed
turned down for the night, and certain lingerie, which they were
without, laid out for them."You might think this was a
hotel.""We haven't tried, yet--wait until morning."A pack of cards was on the
table.Come, I'll play you Camden for a
cent a point.""I can't understand what their move is?""What
can they hope to accomplish by abducting us--or me, at any rate.It
seems they don't want anything from us.""I make it, that they hope to extort something, from a third party,
through us--by holding us prisoners.""Captain Carrington has no money--it can't be he," said Davila, "and
yet, why else should they seize me?""The question is, whose hand are they trying to force?""They will hold us until something is acceded to, the man said.Until _what_ is acceded to, and _by whom_?""You think that we are simply the pawns?""And if it isn't acceded to, they will kill us?""We won't contemplate it, just yet.They may gain their point, or we may
be rescued; in either case, we'll be saved from dying!""And, at the worst, I may be able to buy them off--to pay our own
ransom.If it's money they want, we shall not die, I assure you.""If I have to choose between death and paying, I reckon I'll pay.""Yes, I think I can pay," she said quietly."I'm not used to boasting
my wealth, but I can draw my check for a million, and it will be
honored without a moment's question.Does that make you feel easier, my
dear?""Considerably easier," said Davila, with a glad laugh."I couldn't draw
my check for much more than ten thousand cents.I am only----" She
stopped, staring."What on earth is the matter, Davila?""I have it!--it's the thieves!""I reckon I must be in a trance,
also.""Then maybe I shouldn't--but I will.Parmenter's chest is a fortune in
jewels."Croyden has searched for and not
found--and the thieves think----"

"You would better tell me the story," said Elaine, pushing back the
cards.And Davila told her....

"It is too absurd!"laughed Elaine, "those rogues trying to force
Geoffrey to divide what he hasn't got, and can't find, and we abducted
to constrain him.He couldn't comply if he wanted to, poor fellow!""But they will never believe it," said Davila.Well, if we're not rescued shortly, I can
advance the price and buy our freedom.I
reckon two hundred thousand will be sufficient--and, maybe, we can
compromise for one hundred thousand.it's not so bad, Davila, it's
not so bad!"Unless she were wofully mistaken, this abduction
would release her from the embarrassment of declaring herself to
Geoffrey."I was thinking of Colin and Geoffrey--and how they are pretty sure to
know their minds when this affair is ended."I mean, if this doesn't bring Colin to his senses, he is
hopeless."All his theoretical notions of relative wealth
will be forgotten.I've only to wait for rescue or release.On the
whole, Davila, I'm quite satisfied with being abducted.Moreover, it is
an experience which doesn't come to every girl.""What are you going to do about Colin?I rather
think you should have an answer ready; the circumstances are apt to
make him rather precipitate."The next morning after breakfast, which was served in their rooms,
Elaine was looking out through the bars on her window, trying to get
some notion of the country, when she saw, what she took to be, the
chief abductor approaching.He was a tall, well-dressed man of middle
age, with the outward appearance of a gentleman.She looked at him a
moment, then rang for the maid."I should like to have a word with the man who just came in," she
said.He appeared almost immediately, an inquiring look on his face."How can I serve you, Miss Cavendish?""By permitting us to go out for some air--these rooms were not
designed, apparently, for permanent residence.""You will have no objection to being attended, to
make sure you don't stray off too far, you know?""None whatever, if the attendant remains at a reasonable distance."Elaine asked, when they were some distance
from the house."It is south of Hampton, I think, but I can't
give any reason for my impression.The car was running very rapidly; we
were, I reckon, almost two hours on the way, but we can't be more than
fifty miles away.""If they came direct--but if they circled, we could be much less,"
Elaine observed."It's a pity we didn't think to drop something from the car to inform
our friends which way to look for us.""I tossed out a handkerchief and a glove a short
distance from Hampton--just as I struck that fellow.The difficulty is,
there isn't any assurance we kept to that road.Like as not, we started
north and ended east or south of town.What is this house, a fishing
club?"There is a small wharf, and a board-walk down to
the Bay, and the house itself is one story and spread-out, so to
speak.""Likely it's a summer club-house, which these men have either rented or
preempted for our prison.""Hence, a proper choice for our temporary residence.""I can't understand the care they are taking of us--the deference with
which we are treated, the food that is given us.""Parmenter's treasure, and the prize they think they're playing for,
has much to do with it.We are of considerable value, according to
their idea."After a while, they went back to the house.The two men, who had
remained out of hearing, but near enough to prevent any attempt to
escape, having seen them safely within, disappeared.As they passed
through the hall they encountered the chief."You are incurring considerable expense for nothing.""It is a very great pleasure, I assure you.""You are asking the impossible," she went on.Croyden told you
the simple truth.He _didn't_ find the Parmenter jewels."The man's face showed his surprise, but he only shrugged his shoulders
expressively, and made no reply."I know you do not believe it--yet it's a fact, nevertheless.Croyden couldn't pay your demands, if he wished.Of course, we enjoy
the experience, but, as I said, it's a trifle expensive for you."he said--"a jolly good sport!Macloud, so, you'll pardon me if I decline to
discuss the subject."XIX

ROBERT PARMENTER'S SUCCESSORS


In half-an-hour from the time Captain Carrington strode to the
telephone to arouse his friends, all Hampton had the startling news:
Davila Carrington and her guest, Miss Cavendish, had disappeared.How, when, and where, it could not learn, so it supplied the deficiency
as best pleased the individual--by morning, the wildest tales were
rehearsed and credited.Miss Carrington and Miss Cavendish
were not in the town, nor anywhere within a circuit of five miles.Croyden, Macloud, all the men in the place had searched the night
through, and without avail.Every horse, and every boat had been
accounted for.It remained, that they either had fallen into the Bay,
or had gone in a strange conveyance.Croyden and Macloud had returned to Clarendon for a bite of
breakfast--very late breakfast, at eleven o'clock.They had met by
accident, on their way to the house, having come from totally different
directions of search."Parmenter:--Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways.I told you it was he I saw, yesterday, driving the
automobile.""I don't quite understand why they selected Elaine and Miss Carrington
to abduct," Macloud objected, after a moment's consideration."Because they thought we would come to time more quickly, if they took
the women.They seem to be informed on everything, so, we can assume,
they are acquainted with your fondness for Miss Carrington and mine for
Elaine.Or, it's possible they thought that we both were interested in
Davila--for I've been with her a lot this autumn--and then, at the
pinch, were obliged to take Elaine, also, because she was with her and
would give the alarm if left behind.""A pretty fair scheme," said Macloud."The fellow who is managing this
business knew we would do more for the women than for ourselves.""It's the same old difficulty--we haven't got Parmenter's treasure, but
they refuse to be convinced."The telephone rang, and Croyden himself answered it."Captain Carrington asks that we come over at once," he said, hanging
up the receiver.Half way to the gate, they
met the postman coming up the walk.He handed Croyden a letter, faced
about and trudged away.Croyden glanced at it, mechanically tore open the envelope, and drew it
out.As his eyes fell on the first line, he stopped, abruptly."On Board The Parmenter,
                                      "Pirate Sloop of War,
                             "Off the Capes of the Chesapeake."Dear Sir:--

  "It seems something is required to persuade you that we mean
  business.Therefore, we have abducted Miss Carrington and her
  friend, Miss Cavendish, in the hope that it will rouse you to a
  proper realization of the eternal fitness of things, and of our
  intention that there shall be a division of the jewels--or their
  value in money.Our attorney had the pleasure of an interview
  with you, recently, at which time he specified a sum of two
  hundred and fifty thousand dollars, as being sufficient.A
  further investigation of the probable value of the jewels, having
  convinced us that we were in slight error as to their present
  worth, induces us to reduce the amount, which we claim as our
  share, to two hundred thousand dollars.This is the minimum of
  our demand, however, and we have taken the ladies, aforesaid, as
  security for its prompt payment."They will be held in all comfort and respect (if no effort at
  rescue be attempted--otherwise we will deal with them as we see
  fit), for the period of ten days from the receipt of this letter,
  which will be at noon to-morrow.If the sum indicated is not
  paid, they will, at the expiration of the ten days, be turned
  over to the tender mercies of the crew.--Understand?"As to the manner of payment--You, yourself, must go to
  Annapolis, and, between eleven and twelve in the morning, proceed
  to the extreme edge of Greenberry Point and remain standing, in
  full view from the Bay, for the space of fifteen minutes.You
  will, then, face about, step ten paces, and bury the money, which
  must be in thousand dollar bills, under a foot of sand.You will
  then, immediately, return to Annapolis and take the first car to
  Baltimore, and, thence, to Hampton."In the event that you have not reduced the jewels to cash, we
  will be content with such a division as will insure us a moiety
  thereof.It will be useless to try deception concerning
  them,--though a few thousand dollars, one way or the other, won't
  matter.When you have complied with these terms, the young women
  will be released and permitted to return to Hampton.If not--they
  will wish they were dead, even before they are.We are, sir, with
  deep respect,

                       "Y'r h'mbl.serv'ts,

                               "Robert Parmenter's Successors."Geoffrey Croyden, Esq'r.It was postmarked Hampton, 6.30 A.M.,
of that day."Which implies that it was mailed some time during the night," said
he."Do you mean, will they carry out their threat?""They have been rather persistent," Macloud replied.Damn
Parmenter and his infernal letter!""Parmenter is not to blame," said Macloud."And damn my carelessness in letting them pick my pocket!"Well, the thing, now, is to save the women--and how?""The two hundred thousand I got
for the Virginia Development bonds will be just enough.""I'm in for half, old man.Aside from any personal
feelings we may have for the women in question," he said, with a
serious sort of smile, "we owe it to them--they were abducted solely
because of us--to force us to disgorge.""I'm ready to pay the cash at once.""We have ten days, and the police
can take a try at it.""They're
all bunglers--they will be sure to make a mess of it, and, then, no man
can foresee what will happen.It's not right to subject the women to
the risk.Let us pay first, and punish after--if we can catch the
scoundrels.How long do you think Henry Cavendish will hesitate when he
learns that Elaine has been abducted, and the peril which menaces
her?""Just what he shouldn't be," Croyden returned."What is the good in
alarming him?Free her--then she may tell him, or not, as it pleases
her.""Our first duty _is_ to save the women, the rest can
bide until they are free."Much obliged, old man," said Croyden, "but a wire will do it--they're
all listed on New York.""Will you lose much, if you sell now?"He wished Croyden
would let him pay the entire amount."Just about even; a little to the good, in fact," was the answer.And Macloud said no more--he knew it was useless.At Ashburton, they found Captain Carrington pacing the long hall, in
deep distress--uncertain what course to pursue, because there was no
indication as to what had caused the disappearance.He turned, as the
two men entered."The detectives are quizzing the servants in the library," he said."I
couldn't sit still.--You have news?"he exclaimed, reading Croyden's
face.said Croyden, and gave him the letter.As he read, concern, perplexity, amazement, anger, all
showed in his countenance."They have been abducted!--Davila and Miss Cavendish, and are held for
ransom!--a fabulous ransom, which you are asked to pay," he said,
incredulously."So much, at least, is intelligible.Who
are Robert Parmenter's Successors?--and who was he?and the jewels?--I
cannot understand----"

"I'm not surprised," said Croyden."It's a long story--too long to
tell--save that Parmenter was a pirate, back in 1720, who buried a
treasure on Greenberry Point, across the Severn from Annapolis, you
know, and died, making Marmaduke Duval his heir, under certain
conditions.Marmaduke, in turn, passed it on to his son, and so on,
until Colonel Duval bequeathed it to me.Macloud and
I--for three weeks, but did not find it.Our secret was chanced upon by
two rogues, who, with their confederates, however, are under the
conviction we _did_ find it.I laughed at
them--and this abduction is the result.""Because they think I can be coerced more easily.They are under the
impression that I am--fond of Miss Carrington.At any rate, they know
I'm enough of a friend to pay, rather than subject her to the hazard."My whole fortune isn't over twenty thousand dollars.It I will gladly sacrifice, but more is impossible.""You're not to pay, my old friend," said Croyden.Macloud and I
are the ones aimed at and we will pay.""There is no reason
for you----"

"Tut!said Croyden, "you forget that we are wholly responsible;
but for us, Miss Carrington and Miss Cavendish would not have been
abducted.The obligation is ours, and we will discharge it.It is our
plain, our very plain, duty."The old man threw up his hands in the extremity of despair.We'll have Miss Carrington back in
three days.""And safe--if the letter is trustworthy, and I think it is.The police
can't do as well--they may fail entirely--and think of the possible
consequences!Miss Carrington and Miss Cavendish are very handsome
women."If they were
men, or children, it would be different--they could take some chances.--He sank on a chair and covered his face with his hands."You must let me pay what I am able," he insisted."All that I
have----"

Croyden let his hand fall sympathizingly on the other's shoulder."It shall be as you wish," he said quietly."We will pay, and you can
settle with us afterward--our stocks can be converted instantly, you
see, while yours will likely require some time.""I've been sort of unmanned--I'm better now.Shall you show the detectives the letter--tell them we are going to pay
the amount demanded?""I don't know," said Croyden, uncertainly."What's your opinion,
Colin?""Let them see the letter," Macloud answered, "but on the distinct
stipulation, that they make no effort to apprehend 'Robert Parmenter's
Successors' until the women are safely returned.They may pick up
whatever clues they can obtain for after use, but they must not do
anything which will arouse suspicion, even.""Why take them into our confidence at all?""For two reasons: It's acting square with them (which, it seems to me,
is always the wise thing to do).And, if they are not let in on the
facts, they may blunder in and spoil everything.We want to save the
women at the earliest moment, without any possible handicaps due to
ignorance or inadvertence.""We will have to explain the letter, its reference to the Parmenter
jewels, and all that it contains."We didn't find the treasure, and, I reckon,
they're welcome to search, if they think there is a chance.""Well, let it be exactly as you wish--you're quite as much concerned
for success as I am," said Croyden."Possibly, more so," returned Macloud, seriously.The two detectives arose at their
entrance.The one, Rebbert, was a Pinkerton man, the other, Sanders,
was from the Bureau at City Hall.Both were small men, with clean
shaven faces, steady, searching eyes, and an especially quiet manner.Croyden," said Rebbert, "we have been questioning the servants,
but have obtained nothing of importance, except that the ladies wore
their hats and coats (at least, they have disappeared).This, with the
fact that you found Miss Cavendish's glove and handkerchief, on a road
without the limits of Hampton, leads to the conclusion that they have
been abducted.Miss Carrington, we are informed, has no great
wealth--how as to Miss Cavendish?""She has more than sufficient--in fact, she is very rich----"

"Ah!then we _have_ a motive," said the detective."There is a motive, but it is not Miss Cavendish," Croyden answered."You're correct as to the abduction, however--this will explain," and
he handed him the letter."At noon to-day," replied Croyden, passing over the envelope."Do you object to explaining certain things in this letter?""Not in the least," replied Croyden."I'll tell you the entire
story.... Is there anything I have missed?"Now, we prefer that you should take no measures to
apprehend the abductors, until after Miss Cavendish and Miss
Carrington have been released.We are going to pay the amount
demanded.""Going to pay the two hundred thousand dollars!"cried the detectives,
in one breath."Afterward, you can get as busy as you like."A knowing smile broke over the men's faces, at the same instant."It looks that way, sir," said Rebbert; while Sanders acquiesced, with
another smile.Croyden turned to Macloud and held up his hands, hopelessly.XX

THE CHECK


On the second morning after their abduction, when Elaine and Davila
arose, the sky was obscured by fog, the trees exuded moisture, and only
a small portion of the Bay was faintly visible through the mist."We must have moved out to
Northumberland, in the night."Davila smiled, a feeble sort of smile.It was not a morning to promote
light-heartedness, and particularly under such circumstances."Yes!--Only Northumberland is more so.For a misty day, this would be
remarkably fine.--With us, it's midnight at noon--all the lights
burning, in streets, and shops, and electric cars, bells jangling,
people rushing, pushing, diving through the dirty blackness, like
devils in hell.Oh, it's pleasant, when you get used to it.--Ever been
there?""No," said Davila, "I haven't.""We must have you out--say, immediately after the holidays."I'll be glad to come, if I'm alive--and we ever get out of this awful
place.""It _is_ stupid here," said Elaine."I thought there was something
novel in being abducted, but it's rather dreary business.I'm ready to
quit, are you?""I was ready to quit before we started!""We will see what can be done about it."Ask the chief to be kind enough to come here a
moment," she said, to the girl who attended them.In a few minutes, he appeared--suave, polite, courteous."You sent for me, Miss Cavendish?"Sit down, please, I've something to say to you, Mr.----"

"Jones, for short," he replied.Jones, for short--you will pardon me, I know, if I seem unduly
personal, but these quarters are not entirely to our liking.""I'm very sorry, indeed," he replied."We tried to make them
comfortable.In what are they unsatisfactory?--we will remedy it, if
possible.""We would prefer another locality--Hampton, to be specific.""You mean that you are tired of captivity?""I see your
point of view, and I'm hopeful that Mr.Croyden will see it, also, and
permit us to release you, in a few days.""It is that very point I wish to discuss a moment with you," she
interrupted.Croyden didn't find the
jewels and that, therefore, it is impossible for him to pay.""You will pardon me if I doubt your statement.--Moreover, we are not
privileged to discuss the matter with you.Croyden, as I think I have already intimated.""Then you will draw an empty covert," she replied."That remains to be seen, as I have also intimated," said Mr."But you don't want to draw an empty covert, do you--to have only your
trouble for your pains?""It would be a great disappointment, I assure you.""You have been at considerable expense to provide for our
entertainment?""Pray do not mention it!--it's a very great pleasure.""It would be a greater pleasure to receive the cash?""Since the cash is our ultimate aim, I confess it would be equally
satisfactory," he replied."Are _we_ not
to be given a chance to find the cash?""But assume that he cannot," she reiterated, "or won't--it's the same
result.""In that event, you----"

"Would be given the opportunity," she broke in."Then why not let us consider the matter in the first instance?"It can make no difference to you whence
it comes--from Mr."And it would be much more simple to accept a check and to release us
when it is paid?""Checks are not accepted in this business!""Ordinarily not, it would be too dangerous, I admit.But if it could be
arranged to your satisfaction, what then?""I don't think it can be arranged," he replied."And that amount is----" she persisted, smiling at him the while."None--not a fraction of a penny!""I want to know why you think it can't be arranged?"No bank would pay a check for that amount to
an unknown party, without the personal advice of the drawer.""Not if it were made payable to self, and properly indorsed for
identification?""You can try it--there's no harm in trying.When it's paid, they will pay you.If it's not paid, there
is no harm done--and we are still your prisoners.You stand to win
everything and lose nothing.""If it isn't paid, you still have us," said Elaine.If the check is presented, it will be paid--you may
rest easy, on that score.""But remember," she cautioned, "when it is paid, we are to be released,
instantly.If we play
square with you, you must play square with us.I risk a fortune, see
that you make good.""Your check--it should be one of the sort you always use----"

"I always carry a few blank checks in my handbag--and fortunately, I
have it with me.You were careful to wrap it in with my arms.In a moment she returned, the blank check in
her fingers, and handed it to him.It was of a delicate robin's-egg
blue, with "The Tuscarora Trust Company" printed across the face in a
darker shade, and her monogram, in gold, at the upper end."Is it sufficiently individual to raise a presumption of regularity?""Then, let us understand each other," she said."I give you my check for two hundred thousand dollars, duly executed,
payable to my order, and endorsed by me, which, when paid, you, on
behalf of your associates and yourself, engage to accept in lieu of the
amount demanded from Mr.Croyden, and to release Miss Carrington and
myself forthwith.""There is one thing more," he said."You, on your part, are to
stipulate that no attempt will be made to arrest us.""We will engage that _we_ will do nothing to apprehend you.""Yes!--more than that is not in our power.You will have to assume the
general risk you took when you abducted us.""We will take it," was the quiet answer."I think not--at least, everything is entirely satisfactory to us.""Despite the fact that it couldn't be made so!""I didn't know we had to deal with a woman of such business sense
and--wealth," he answered gallantly."If you will get me ink and pen, I will sign the check,"
she said.She filled it in for the amount specified, signed and endorsed it.Then
she took, from her handbag, a correspondence card, embossed with her
initials, and wrote this note:

                                              "Hampton, Md.Thompson:--

  "I have made a purchase, down here, and my check for Two Hundred
  Thousand dollars, in consideration, will come through, at once."Yours very sincerely,

                                            "Elaine Cavendish."To James Thompson, Esq'r., "Treasurer, The Tuscarora Trust Co.,
  "Northumberland."She addressed the envelope and passed it and the card across to Mr."If you will mail this, to-night, it will provide against any chance of
non-payment," she said."You are a marvel of accuracy," he answered, with a bow."I would I
could always do business with you."monsieur, I pray thee, no
more!"There was a knock on the door; the maid entered and spoke in a low tone
to Jones."I am sorry to inconvenience you again," he said, turning to them, "but
I must trouble you to go aboard the tug.""On the water--that is usually the place for well behaved tugs!""Now--before I go to deposit the check!""You will be safer
on the tug.There will be no danger of an escape or a rescue--and it
won't be for long, I trust.""Your trust is no greater than ours, I assure you," said Elaine.Their few things were quickly gathered, and they went down to the
wharf, where a small boat was drawn up ready to take them to the tug,
which was lying a short distance out in the Bay."One of the Baltimore tugs, likely," said Davila."There are scores of
them, there, and some are none too chary about the sort of business
they are employed in."Jones conducted them to the little
cabin, which they were to occupy together--an upper and a lower bunk
having been provided."The maid will sleep in the galley," said he."She will look after the
cooking, and you will dine in the small cabin next to this one.It's a
bit contracted quarters for you, and I'm sorry, but it won't be for
long--as we both trust, Miss Cavendish."I will have my bank send it direct for
collection, with instructions to wire immediately if paid.I presume
you don't wish it to go through the ordinary course.""The check, and your note, should reach
the Trust Company in the same mail to-morrow morning; they can be
depended upon to wire promptly, I presume?""Then, we may be able to release you to-morrow night, certainly by
Saturday.""It can't come too soon for us.""You don't seem to like our hospitality," Jones observed."It's excellent of its sort, but we don't fancy the sort--you
understand, monsieur.And then, too, it is frightfully expensive.""We have done the best we could under the circumstances," he smiled."Until Saturday at the latest--meanwhile, permit me to offer you a very
hopeful farewell.""Why do you treat him so amiably?""I couldn't, if I
would."It wouldn't help our case
to be sullen--and it might make it much worse.I would gladly shoot
him, and hurrah over it, too, as I fancy you would do, but it does no
good to show it, now--when we _can't_ shoot him.""But I'm glad I don't have to play the
part.""Elaine, I don't know how to thank you
for my freedom----"

"Wait until you have it!""Though there isn't a
doubt of the check being paid.""My grandfather, I know, will repay you with his entire fortune, but
that will be little----"

Elaine stopped her further words by placing a hand over her mouth, and
kissing her."Take it that the reward is for
my release, and that you were just tossed in for good measure--or, that
it is a slight return for the pleasure of visiting you--or, that the
money is a small circumstance to me--or, that it is a trifling sum to
pay to be saved the embarrassment of proposing to Geoffrey,
myself--or, take it any way you like, only, don't bother your pretty
head an instant more about it.In the slang of the day: 'Forget it,'
completely and utterly, as a favor to me if for no other reason.""I'll promise to forget it--until we're free," agreed Davila."And, in the meantime, let us have a look around this old boat," said
Elaine."You're nearer the door, will you open it?Davila tried the door--it refused to open.we will content ourselves with watching the Bay through the
port hole, and when one wants to turn around the other can crawl up in
her bunk.I'm going to write a book about this experience, some
time.--I wonder what Geoffrey and Colin are doing?"she
laughed--"running around like mad and stirring up the country, I
reckon."XXI

THE JEWELS


Macloud went to New York on the evening train.He carried Croyden's
power of attorney with stock sufficient, when sold, to make up his
share of the cash.He had provided for his own share by a wire to his
brokers and his bank in Northumberland.He would reduce both amounts to one thousand dollar bills and hurry
back to Annapolis to meet Croyden.But they counted not on the railroads,--or rather they did count on
them, and they were disappointed.A freight was derailed just south of
Hampton, tearing up the track for a hundred yards, and piling the right
of way with wreckage of every description.Macloud's train was twelve
hours late leaving Hampton.Then, to add additional ill luck, they ran
into a wash out some fifty miles further on; with the result that they
did not reach New York until after the markets were over and the banks
had closed for the day.The following day, he sold the stocks,
the brokers gave him the proceeds in the desired bills, after the
delivery hour, and he made a quick get-away for Annapolis, arriving
there at nine o'clock in the evening.Croyden was awaiting him, at Carvel Hall."I'm sorry, for the girls' sake," said he, "but it's only a day lost.And, then, pray God, they be freed
before another night!That lawyer thief is a rogue and a robber, but
something tells me he will play straight.""I reckon we will have to trust him," returned Macloud.He will be over on the Point in the morning, disguised
as a <DW64> and chopping wood, on the edge of the timber.There isn't
much chance of him identifying the gang, but it's the best we can do.It's the girls first, the scoundrels afterward, if possible."At eleven o'clock the following day, Croyden, mounted on one of
"Cheney's Best," rode away from the hotel.There had been a sudden
change in the weather, during the night; the morning was clear and
bright and warm, as happens, sometimes, in Annapolis, in late November.The Severn, blue and placid, flung up an occasional white cap to greet
him, as he crossed the bridge.He nodded to the draw-keeper, who
recognized him, drew aside for an automobile to pass, and then trotted
sedately up the hill, and into the woods beyond.He could hear the Band of the Academy pounding out a quick-step, and
catch a glimpse of the long line of midshipmen passing in review,
before some notable.The "custard and cream" of the chapel dome
obtruded itself in all its hideousness; the long reach of Bancroft Hall
glowed white in the sun; the library with its clock--the former, by
some peculiar idea, placed at the farthest point from the dormitory,
and the latter where the midshipmen cannot see it--dominated the
opposite end of the grounds.Everywhere was quiet, peace, and
discipline--the embodiment of order and law,--the Flag flying over
all.And yet, he was on his way to pay a ransom of very considerable amount,
for two women who were held prisoners!He tied his horse to a limb of a maple, and walked out on the Point.Save for a few trees, uprooted by the gales, it was the same Point they
had dug over a few weeks before.A <DW64>, chopping at a log, stopped
his work, a moment, to look at him curiously, then resumed his labor.thought Croyden, but he made no effort to speak to
him.Somewhere,--from a window in the town, or from one of the numerous
ships bobbing about on the Bay or the River--he did not doubt a glass
was trained on him, and his every motion was being watched.For full twenty minutes, he stood on the extreme tip of the Point, and
looked out to sea.Then he faced directly around and stepped ten paces
inland.Kneeling, he quickly dug with a small trowel a hole a foot deep
in the sand, put into it the package of bills, wrapped in oil-skin,
and replaced the ground."Pirate's gold breeds pirate's ways.May
we have seen the last of you--and may the devil take you all!"He went slowly back to his horse, mounted, and rode back to town.They
had done their part--would the thieves do theirs?Adhering strictly to the instructions, Croyden and Macloud left
Annapolis on the next car, caught the boat at Baltimore, and arrived in
Hampton in the evening, in time for dinner.They stopped a few minutes
at Ashburton, to acquaint Captain Carrington with their return, and
then went on to Clarendon.Neither wanted the other to know and each
endeavored to appear at ease.He threw his cigarette into his coffee cup, and
pushed his chair back from the table."You're trying to appear nonchalant,
and you're doing it very well, too, but you can't control your fingers
and your eyes--and neither can I, I fancy, though I've tried hard
enough, God knows!These four days of strain and
uncertainty have taken it all out of us.If I had any doubt as to my
affection for Elaine, it's vanished, now.----I don't say I'm fool
enough to propose to her, yet I'm scarcely responsible, at present.If
I were to see her this minute, I'd likely do something rash.""You're coming around to it, gradually," said Macloud.I don't know about the 'gradually.'I want to pull
myself together--to get a rein on myself--to--what are you smiling at;
am I funny?""I never saw a man fight so hard against his
personal inclinations, and a rich wife.You don't deserve her!--if I
were Elaine, I'd turn you down hard, hard.""And hence, with a woman's unreasonableness and trust in the one she
loves, she will likely accept you."Macloud blew a couple of smoke rings and watched them sail upward."I suppose you're equally discerning as to Miss Carrington, and her
love for you," Croyden commented."I regret to say, I'm not," said Macloud, seriously."That is what
troubles me, indeed.Unlike my friend, Geoffrey Croyden, I'm perfectly
sure of my own mind, but I'm not sure of the lady's.""Then, why don't you find out?""Exactly what I shall do, when she returns."We each seem to be able to answer the other's uncertainty," he
remarked, calmly."I'm going over to Ashburton, and talk with the Captain a little--sort
of cheer him up."It's a very good occupation for you, sitting up to
the old gent.I'll give you a chance by staying away, to-night.Make a
hit with grandpa, Colin, make a hit with grandpa!""And you make a hit with yourself--get rid of your foolish theory, and
come down to simple facts," Macloud retorted, and he went out."Get rid of your foolish theory," Croyden soliloquized."Well,
maybe--but _is_ it foolish, that's the question?I'm poor, once
more--I've not enough even for Elaine Cavendish's husband--there's the
rub!she won't be Geoffrey Croyden's wife, it's I who will be Elaine
Cavendish's husband.'Elaine Cavendish _and her husband_ dine with us
to-night!'--'Elaine Cavendish _and her husband_ were at the horse
show!''Elaine Cavendish _and her husband_ were here!--or there!--or
thus and so!'"It would be too belittling, too disparaging of
self-respect.--Elaine Cavendish's husband!--Elaine Cavendish's
husband!Might he out-grow it--be known for himself?He glanced up at
the portrait of the gallant soldier of a lost cause, with the high-bred
face and noble bearing."You were a brave man, Colonel Duval!"He took out a cigar, lit it very deliberately, and fell to thinking....
Presently, worn out by fatigue and anxiety, he dozed....

                  *       *       *       *       *

And as he dozed, the street door opened softly, a light step crossed
the hall, and Elaine Cavendish stood in the doorway.She was clad in black velvet, trimmed in sable.A
blue cloak was thrown, with careless grace, about her gleaming
shoulders.One slender hand lifted the gown from before her feet.She
saw the sleeping man and paused, and a smile of infinite tenderness
passed across her face.A moment she hesitated, and at the thought, a faint blush suffused her
face.Then she glided softly over, bent and kissed him on the lips.She was there, before him,
the blush still on cheek and brow.And, straightway took her, unresisting,
in his arms....

"Tell me all about yourself," he said, at last, drawing her down into
the chair and seating himself on the arm."Where is Miss
Carrington--safe?""Colin's with her--I reckon she's safe!""It won't be
his fault if she isn't, I'm sure.--I left them at Ashburton, and came
over here to--you.""I'll go back at once----"

He laughed, joyously."My hair,
dear,--do be careful!""I'll be good--if you will kiss me again!""But you're not asleep," she objected."And you will promise--not to kiss me again?"She looked up at him tantalizingly, her red lips parted, her bosom
fluttering below."If it's worth coming half way for, sweetheart--you may," she said....

"Now, if you're done with foolishness--for a little while," she said,
gayly, "I'll tell you how we managed to get free.""Oh, yes!--the Parmenter jewels.Davila told me the story, and how you
didn't find them, though our abductors think you did, and won't believe
otherwise.""None--we were most courteously treated; and they released us, as
quickly as the check was paid.""I mean, that I gave them my check for the ransom money--you hadn't the
jewels, you couldn't comply with the demand.I knew you couldn't pay it, so I did.Don't let us think of
it, dear!--It's over, and we have each other, now.Then suddenly she, woman-like, went straight back to
it."How did you think we managed to get free--escaped?""Yes--I never thought of your paying the money."she said, "you are deceiving me!--you are--_you_ paid the money,
also!"Macloud and I _did_ pay the ransom to-day--but of what consequence is
it; whether you bought your freedom, or we bought it, or both bought
it?You and Davila are here, again--that's the only thing that
matters!"came Macloud's voice from the
hallway, and Davila and he walked into the room.Elaine, with a little shriek, sprang up."Davila and I were occupying similar
positions at Ashburton, a short time ago.as
he made a motion to put his arm around her.Davila eluded him--though the traitor red confirmed his words--and
sought Elaine's side for safety."It's a pleasure only deferred, my dear!""By the way,
Elaine, how did Croyden happen to give in?He was shying off at your
wealth--said it would be giving hostages to fortune, and all that
rot.""I'm going to try to make
good.""Geoffrey," said Elaine, "won't you show us the old pirate's
letter--we're all interested in it, now.""I'll show you the letter, and where I
found it, and anything else you want to see.Croyden opened the secret drawer, and
took out the letter.he said, solemnly, and handed it to Elaine.She carried it to the table, spread it out under the lamp, and Davila
and she studied it, carefully, even as Croyden and Macloud had
done--reading the Duval endorsements over and over again."It seems to me there is something queer about these postscripts," she
said, at last; "something is needed to make them clear.Is this the
entire letter?--didn't you find anything else?""It's a bit dark in this hole.She struck it, and peered back into the recess."Here is something!--only a corner visible.""It has slipped down, back of the false partition.She drew out a tiny sheet of paper, and handed it to Croyden.Croyden glanced at it; then gave a cry of amazed surprise.The rest crowded around him while he read:

                                         "Hampton, Maryland."Memorandum to accompany the letter of Robert Parmenter, dated 10
  May 1738."Whereas, it is stipulated by the said Parmenter that the Jewels
  shall be used only in the Extremity of Need; and hence, as I have
  an abundance of this world's Goods, that Need will, likely, not
  come to me.And judging that Greenberry Point will change, in
  time--so that my son or his Descendants, if occasion arise, may
  be unable to locate the Treasure--I have lifted the Iron box,
  from the place where Parmenter buried it, and have reinterred it
  in the cellar of my House in Hampton, renewing the Injunction
  which Parmenter put upon it, that it shall be used only in the
  Extremity of Need.When this Need arise, it will be found in the
  south-east corner of the front cellar.At the depth of two feet,
  between two large stones, is the Iron box.It contains the
  jewels, the most marvelous I have ever seen.For a moment, they stood staring at one another too astonished to
speak."To think that it was here, all
the time!"They trooped down to the cellar, Croyden leading the way.Moses was off
for the evening, they had the house to themselves.As they passed the
foot of the stairs, Macloud picked up a mattock."Which is the south-east corner,
Davila?""The ground is not especially hard," observed Macloud, with the first
stroke."I reckon a yard square is sufficient.--At a depth of two feet
the memorandum says, doesn't it?"Fascinated, they were watching the fall of the pick.With every blow, they were listening for it to strike the stones."Better get a shovel, Croyden, we'll need it," said Macloud, pausing
long enough, to throw off his coat.... "Oh!I forgot to say, I wired
the Pinkerton man to recover the package you buried this morning."Croyden only nodded--stood the lamp on a box, and returned with the
coal scoop."This will answer, I reckon," he said, and fell to work.remarked Macloud, between strokes."To have hunted
the treasure, for weeks, all over Greenberry Point, and then to find it
in the cellar, like a can of lard or a bushel of potatoes.""You haven't found it, yet," Croyden cautioned."And we've gone the
depth mentioned."we haven't found it, yet!--but we're going to find it!"Macloud
answered, sinking the pick, viciously, in the ground, with the last
word.Macloud cried, sinking the pick in at another
place.The fifth stroke laid the stone
bare--the sixth and seventh loosened it, still more--the eighth and
ninth completed the task.When the earth was away and the stone exposed, he stooped and, putting
his fingers under the edges, heaved it out."The rest is for you, Croyden!"For a moment, Croyden looked at it, rather dazedly.Could it be the
jewels were _there_!--within his reach!--under that lid!Suddenly, he
laughed!--gladly, gleefully, as a boy--and sprang down into the hole.The box clung to its resting place for a second, as though it was
reluctant to be disturbed--then it yielded, and Croyden swung it onto
the bank."We'll take it to the library," he said, scraping it clean of the
adhering earth.And carrying it before them, like the Ark of the Covenant, they went
joyously up to the floor above.He placed it on the table under the chandelier, where all could see.It
was of iron, rusty with age; in dimension, about a foot square; and
fastened by a hasp, with the bar of the lock thrust through but not
secured."Light the gas, Colin!--every burner," he said."We'll have the full
effulgence, if you please."...The scintillations which leaped out to meet them, were like the rays
from myriads of gleaming, glistening, varicolored lights, of dazzling
brightness and infinite depth.A wonderful cavern of coruscating
splendor--rubies and diamonds, emeralds and sapphires, pearls and opals
glowing with all the fire of self, and the resentment of long neglect."You may touch them--they will not
fade."They put them out on the table--in little heaps of color.The women
exclaiming whene'er they touched them, cooingly as a woman does when
handling jewels--fondling them, caressing them, loving them.They stood back and gazed--fascinated by it
all:--the color--the glowing reds and whites, and greens and blues."It is wonderful--and it's true!"Two necklaces lay among the rubies, alike as lapidary's art could make
them.Croyden handed one to Macloud, the other he took."In remembrance of your release, and of Parmenter's treasure!"he said,
and clasped it around Elaine's fair neck.Macloud clasped his around Davila's."Who cares, now, for the time spent on Greenberry Point or the double
reward!"*       *       *       *       *




Transcriber's note:

Minor changes have been made to correct typesetters' errors;
otherwise, every effort has been made to remain true to the
author's words and intent.Delivered him to
his white-faced little wife."Hm-m; well, that's what one million did--inherited.It set me to
thinking--of mine, when I get through with them."The lawyer's lips came together a little grimly."You've not
made your will, I believe."Funny how a man'll fight shy of a little
thing like that, isn't it?And when we're so mighty particular where it
goes while we're living!""Yes, I know; you're not the only one.You have relatives--somewhere, I
surmise.""Nothing nearer than cousins, third or fourth, back East.They'd get
it, I suppose--without a will."The millionaire repeated the wry face of a moment before.I never did care much for women; and--I'm not
fool enough to think that a woman would be apt to fall in love with my
bald head.Nor am I obliging enough to care to hand the millions over
to the woman that falls in love with THEM, taking me along as the
necessary sack that holds the gold.If it comes to that, I'd rather
risk the cousins.They, at least, are of my own blood, and they didn't
angle to get the money.""Why not pick out a bunch of colleges and endow them?""Doesn't appeal to me, somehow.Oh, of course it ought to, but--it just
doesn't.Maybe if I was a college man myself; but--well, I
had to dig for what education I got."There are numberless organizations
that--" He stopped abruptly at the other's uplifted hand.Good Heavens, I should think there were!I got that philanthropic bee in my bonnet, and I gave thousands,
tens of thousands to 'em.Then I got to wondering where the money went.""You never did like to invest without investigating, Fulton," he
observed.With only a shrug for an answer the other plunged on.I'm not saying that organized charity isn't all
right, and doesn't do good, of course.Neither am I prepared to propose
anything to take its place.And maybe the two or three I dealt with
were particularly addicted to the sort of thing I objected to.But,
honestly, Ned, if you'd lost heart and friends and money, and were just
ready to chuck the whole shooting-match, how would you like to become a
'Case,' say, number twenty-three thousand seven hundred and forty-one,
ticketed and docketed, and duly apportioned off to a six-by-nine rule
of 'do this' and 'do that,' while a dozen spectacled eyes watched you
being cleaned up and regulated and wound up with a key made of just so
much and no more pats and preachments carefully weighed and labeled?"I know; but, my dear fellow, what would you have?Surely, UNorganized
charity and promiscuous giving is worse--"

"Oh, yes, I've tried that way, too," shrugged the other."There was a
time when every Tom, Dick, and Harry, with a run-down shoe and a ragged
coat, could count on me for a ten-spot by just holding out his hand, no
questions asked.Then a serious-eyed little woman sternly told me one
day that the indiscriminate charity of a millionaire was not only a
curse to any community, but a corruption to the whole state.I believe
she kindly included the nation, as well, bless her!There was a whimsical smile in the
lawyer's eyes.It set
me to thinking, and I began to follow up those ten-spots--the ones that
I could trace.Oh, some of them were
all right, of course, and I made THOSE fifties on the spot.I tell you, Ned, money that isn't earned is the most risky
thing in the world.If I'd left half those wretches alone, they'd have
braced up and helped themselves and made men of themselves, maybe.As
it was--Well, you never can tell as to the results of a so-called
'good' action.From my experience I should say they are every whit as
dangerous as the bad ones.""But, my dear fellow, that's just where the organized charity comes in."Oh, yes, I know--Case number twenty-three thousand seven hundred and
forty-one!Relief of some sort is
absolutely necessary.But I'd like to see a little warm sympathy
injected into it, some way.Give the machine a heart, say, as well as
hands and a head.""Then why don't you try it yourself?""I have tried it, in a
way, and failed.That's why I'd like some one else to tackle the job.And that brings me right back to my original question.I'm wondering
what my money will do, when I'm done with it.I'd like to have one of
my own kin have it--if I was sure of him.Money is a queer proposition,
Ned, and it's capable of--'most anything.""What I can do with it, and what some one else can do with it, are two
quite different matters.I don't consider my efforts to circulate it
wisely, or even harmlessly, exactly what you'd call a howling success.Whatever I've done, I've always been criticized for not doing something
else.If I gave a costly entertainment, I was accused of showy
ostentation.If I didn't give it, I was accused of not putting money
into honest circulation.If I donated to a church, it was called
conscience money; and if I didn't donate to it, they said I was mean
and miserly.I was just wondering--what the
other fellow'd do with it.""But it will--if I give it to him.what money does
for folks, sometimes--folks that aren't used to it!Look at Bixby; and
look at that poor little Marston girl, throwing herself away on that
worthless scamp of a Gowing who's only after her money, as everybody
(but herself) knows!And if it doesn't make knaves and martyrs of them,
ten to one it does make fools of 'em.They're worse than a kid with a
dollar on circus day; and they use just about as much sense spending
their pile, too.You should have heard dad tell about his pals in the
eighties that struck it rich in the gold mines.One bought up every
grocery store in town and instituted a huge free grab-bag for the
populace; and another dropped his hundred thousand in the dice box
before it was a week old.I wonder what those cousins of mine back East
are like!""If you're fearful, better take Case number twenty-three thousand seven
hundred and forty-one," smiled the lawyer."Hm-m; I suppose so," ejaculated the other grimly, getting to his feet.A moment later the door of the lawyer's sumptuously appointed office
closed behind him.Not twenty-four hours afterward, however, it opened
to admit him again.He was alert, eager-eyed, and smiling.Even the office boy who ushered him in cocked a
curious eye at him.The man at the great flat-topped desk gave a surprised ejaculation.Those biscuits must be agreeing with you," he laughed."Ned, I've got a scheme.Stanley G.
Fulton strode across the room and dropped himself into the waiting
chair.Well, I'm going to find out
which of 'em I want for my heir.""Another case of investigating before investing, eh?"Going to
get acquainted with them, I suppose, and see how they treat you.Then
you can size them up as to hearts and habits, and drop the golden plum
into the lap of the worthy man, eh?"I'm going to give 'em say fifty
or a hundred thousand apiece, and--"

"GIVE it to them--NOW?"How'm I going to know how they'll spend money till they have it
to spend?""I know; but--"

"Oh, I've planned all that.Of course you'll have to fix
it up for me.I shall leave instructions with you, and when the time
comes all you have to do is to carry them out.""Oh, I'm going to be there, in Hillerton.""Yes, where the cousins live, you know.Of course I want to see how it
works."I suppose you think you'll find out--with you watching their
every move!"The lawyer had settled back in his chair, an ironical
smile on his lips."Oh, they won't know me, of course, except as John Smith."I'm going to take that name--for a time.""Really, my dear Ned,
I'm disappointed in you.You don't seem to realize the possibilities of
this thing.""Oh, yes, I do--perhaps better than you, old man," retorted the other
with an expressive glance.I never
saw them, and they never saw me.I'm going to give them a tidy little
sum of money apiece, and then have the fun of watching them spend it.Any harm in that, especially as it's no one's business what I do with
my money?""N--no, I suppose not--if you can carry such a wild scheme through.""I chose a colorless one on purpose.I'm going to be a colorless
person, you see."Stanley G. Fulton, multi-millionaire,
with his pictured face in half the papers and magazines from the
Atlantic to the Pacific, CAN hide that face behind a colorless John
Smith?"But he can hide it behind a nice little close-cropped
beard."The millionaire stroked his smooth chin reflectively.Nice little New England town, I'm told."And your--er--business in Hillerton, that will enable you to be
the observing fly on your cousins' walls?""Yes, I've thought that all out, too; and that's another brilliant
stroke.I'm going to be a genealogist.I'm going to be at work tracing
the Blaisdell family--their name is Blaisdell.I'm writing a book which
necessitates the collection of an endless amount of data.Now how about
that fly's chances of observation."Mighty poor, if he's swatted--and that's what he will be!New England
housewives are death on flies, I understand."There were exasperation and amusement in the
lawyer's eyes, but there was only mock sympathy in his voice."And to
think I've known you all these years, and never suspected it, Fulton!"The man who owned twenty millions still smiled imperturbably."Oh, yes, I know what you mean, but I'm not crazy.And really I'm
interested in genealogy, too, and I've been thinking for some time I'd
go digging about the roots of my ancestral tree.I have dug a little,
in years gone.My mother was a Blaisdell, you know.Her grandfather was
brother to some ancestor of these Hillerton Blaisdells; and I really am
interested in collecting Blaisdell data.Besides, I shall try to board with one of them."Upon my word, a pretty little scheme!""Yes, I knew you'd appreciate it, the more you thought about it."Stanley G. Fulton's blue eyes twinkled a little.With a disdainful gesture the lawyer brushed this aside."Do you mind telling me how you happened to think of it, yourself?"'Twas a little booklet got out by a Trust Company.""Oh, they didn't suggest exactly this, I'll admit; but they did suggest
that, if you were fearful as to the way your heirs would handle their
inheritance, you could create a trust fund for their benefit while you
were living, and then watch the way the beneficiaries spent the income,
as well as the way the trust fund itself was managed.In this way you
could observe the effects of your gifts, and at the same time be able
to change them if you didn't like results.I'm going to make my cousins a little
rich, and see which, if any of them, can stand being very rich."How are you going to drop a hundred thousand
dollars into three men's laps, and expect to get away without an
investigation as to the why and wherefore of such a singular
proceeding?""That's where your part comes in," smiled the millionaire blandly."Besides, to be accurate, one of the laps is--er--a petticoat one."But--And so this is where I come
in, is it?Well, and suppose I refuse to come in?""Regretfully I shall have to employ another attorney."The blue eyes opposite were still twinkling."In the first place, you're my good friend--my best friend.You
wouldn't be seen letting me start off on a wild-goose chase like this
without your guiding hand at the helm to see that I didn't come a
cropper.""Aren't you getting your metaphors a trifle mixed?"This time the
lawyer's eyes were twinkling.Besides, what
I want you to do is a mere routine of regular business, with you."I'm off for South America, say, on an
exploring tour.In your charge I leave certain papers with instructions
that on the first day of the sixth month of my absence (I being unheard
from), you are to open a certain envelope and act according to
instructions within.Simplest thing in the world, man."Oh, very simple--as you put it.""Well, meanwhile I'll start for South America--alone, of course; and,
so far as you're concerned, that ends it.If on the way, somewhere, I
determine suddenly on a change of destination, that is none of your
affair.If, say in a month or two, a quiet, inoffensive gentleman by
the name of Smith arrives in Hillerton on the legitimate and perfectly
respectable business of looking up a family pedigree, that also is none
of your concern."With a sudden laugh the lawyer fell back in his chair."By Jove, Fulton, if I don't believe you'll pull this absurd thing off!"Now you're talking like a sensible man, and we can get
somewhere.In order
best to judge how my esteemed relatives conduct themselves under the
sudden accession of wealth, I must see them first without it, of
course.Hence, I plan to be in Hillerton some months before your letter
and the money arrive.I intend, indeed, to be on the friendliest terms
with every Blaisdell in Hillerton before that times comes.""Oh, I shall have the best of references and introductions.Bob
Chalmers is the president of a bank there.Well, I shall
take John Smith in and introduce him to Bob some day.After that,
Bob'll introduce John Smith?All I need is a letter as to my
integrity and respectability, I reckon, so my kinsmen won't suspect me
of designs on their spoons when I ask to board with them.You see, I'm
a quiet, retiring gentleman, and I don't like noisy hotels."With an explosive chuckle the lawyer clapped his knee."Fulton, this is
absolutely the richest thing I ever heard of!I'd give a farm to be a
fly on YOUR wall and see you do it.I'm blest if I don't think I'll go
to Hillerton myself--to see Bob.By George, I will go and see Bob!""Of course," agreed the other serenely.Besides, it will be
the most natural thing in the world--business, you know.In fact, I
should think you really ought to go, in connection with the bequests.""How much are you
going to give them?""Oh, a hundred thousand apiece, I reckon.""That ought to do--for pin money.""Oh, well, I want them to have enough, you know, for it to be a real
test of what they would do with wealth.And it must be cash--no
securities."But how are you going to fix it?What excuse are you going to give for
dropping a hundred thousand into their laps like that?You can't tell
your real purpose, naturally!"That part we'll have to fix up in the letter of instructions.But what are
you going to do afterward--when you've found out what you want to know,
I mean?Won't it be something of a shock, when John Smith turns into
Mr."Y-yes, I've thought of that, and I will confess my ideas are a little
hazy, in spots.Roughly, my plan is this now.There'll be two letters of
instructions: one to open in six months, the other to be opened in,
say, a couple of years, or so.(I want to give myself plenty of time
for my observations, you see.)The second letter will really give you
final instructions as to the settling of my estate--my will.I'll have
to make some sort of one, I suppose.""But, good Heavens, Stanley, you--you--" the lawyer came to a helpless
pause."Oh, that's just for emergency, of course, in case
anything--er--happened.What I really intend is that long before the
second letter of instructions is due to be opened, Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton will come back from his South American explorations.He'll then
be in a position to settle his affairs to suit himself, and--er--make a
new will.The millionaire smiled musingly, and stroked his chin again.Well, Smith will have finished collecting Blaisdell data,
of course, and will be off to parts unknown.We don't have to trouble
ourselves with Smith any longer.""Fulton, you're a wizard," laughed the lawyer."But now about the
cousins.You see I've done a little digging already--some years
ago--looking up the Blaisdell family.(By the way, that'll come in fine
now, won't it?)And an occasional letter from Bob has kept me posted as
to deaths and births in the Hillerton Blaisdells.I always meant to
hunt them up some time, they being my nearest kith and kin.Well, with
what I already had, and with what Bob has written me, I know these
facts."He paused, pulled a small notebook from his pocket, and consulted it."There are two sons and a daughter, children of Rufus Blaisdell.Rufus
died years ago, and his widow married a man by the name of Duff.The elder son is Frank Blaisdell.She's about forty-two or three, I
believe, and does dressmaking.James Blaisdell has a son, Fred,
seventeen, and two younger children.Frank Blaisdell has one daughter,
Mellicent.That's the extent of my knowledge, at present."Oh, anything's enough--for your purpose!You'll soon be reading in your morning paper that Mr.Stanley G. Fulton, the somewhat eccentric multi-millionaire, is about
to start for South America, and that it is hinted he is planning to
finance a gigantic exploring expedition.The accounts of what he's
going to explore will vary all the way from Inca antiquities to the
source of the Amazon.I've done a lot of talking to-day, and a good
deal of cautioning as to secrecy, etc.It ought to bear fruit by
to-morrow, or the day after, at the latest.I'm going to start next
week, and I'm really going EXPLORING, too--though not exactly as they
think.I came in to-day to make a business appointment for to-morrow,
please.A man starting on such a hazardous journey must be prepared,
you understand.I want to leave my affairs in such shape that you will
know exactly what to do--in emergency.The lawyer hesitated, his face an odd mixture of determination and
irresolution.To-morrow at ten--if
they don't shut you up before."Stanley G. Fulton leaped to his feet.At the door he turned back jauntily."And, say, Ned, what'll you bet I don't grow fat and young over this
thing?What'll you bet I don't get so I can eat real meat and 'taters
again?"JOHN SMITH


It was on the first warm evening in early June that Miss Flora
Blaisdell crossed the common and turned down the street that led to her
brother James's home.Its spacious green lawns and
elm-shaded walks were the pride of the town.There was a trellised
band-stand for summer concerts, and a tiny pond that accommodated a few
boats in summer and a limited number of skaters in winter.Perhaps,
most important of all, the common divided the plebeian East Side from
the more pretentious West.James Blaisdell lived on the West Side.His
wife said that everybody did who WAS anybody.They had lately moved
there, and were, indeed, barely settled.Her home was a shabby little rented
cottage on the East Side.She was a thin-faced little woman with an
anxious frown and near-sighted, peering eyes that seemed always to be
looking for wrinkles.She peered now at the houses as she passed slowly
down the street.She had been only twice to her brother's new home, and
she was not sure that she would recognize it, in spite of the fact that
the street was still alight with the last rays of the setting sun.Suddenly across her worried face flashed a relieved smile."Well, if you ain't all here out on the piazza!"she exclaimed,
turning, in at the walk leading up to one of the ornate little houses."Oh, yes, it's grand, all right," nodded the tired-looking man in the
big chair, removing his feet from the railing.He was in his
shirt-sleeves, and was smoking a pipe.The droop of his thin mustache
matched the droop of his thin shoulders--and both indefinably but
unmistakably spelled disillusion and discouragement."It's grand, but I
think it's too grand--for us.However, daughter says the best is none
too good--in Hillerton.Bessie, the pretty, sixteen-year-old daughter of the family, only
shrugged her shoulders a little petulantly.It was Harriet, the wife,
who spoke--a large, florid woman with a short upper lip, and a
bewilderment of bepuffed light hair.She was already on her feet,
pushing a chair toward her sister-in-law."Of course it isn't too grand, Jim, and you know it.There aren't any
really nice houses in Hillerton except the Pennocks' and the old
Gaylord place.The little
dressmaker began to fan herself with the hat she had taken off."My,
'tis fur over here, ain't it?Not much like 'twas when you lived right
'round the corner from me!And I had to put on a hat and gloves, too.Someway, I thought I ought to--over here."Condescendingly the bepuffed head threw an approving nod in her
direction.The East Side is different from the West Side, and
no mistake.And what will do there won't do here at all, of course.""How about father's shirt-sleeves?"It was a scornful gibe from Bessie
in the hammock."I don't notice any of the rest of the men around here
sitting out like that.""You know very well I'm not to
blame for what your father wears.I've tried hard enough, I'm sure!""Well, well, Hattie," sighed the man, with a gesture of abandonment."I
supposed I still had the rights of a freeborn American citizen in my
own home; but it seems I haven't."Resignedly he got to his feet and
went into the house.When he returned a moment later he was wearing his
coat.Benny, perched precariously on the veranda railing, gave a sudden
indignant snort.Benny was eight, the youngest of the family."Well, I don't think I like it here, anyhow," he chafed."I'd rather go
back an' live where we did.It hasn't
been anything but 'Here, Benny, you mustn't do that over here, you
mustn't do that over here!'I'm going home an' live
with Aunt Flora.Of course you can," beamed his aunt."But you won't
want to, I'm sure.Why, Benny, I think it's perfectly lovely here.""Indeed I do, Benny," corrected his father hastily."It's very nice
indeed here, of course.But I don't think we can afford it.We had to
squeeze every penny before, and how we're going to meet this rent I
don't know.""You'll earn it, just being here--more business," asserted his wife
firmly."Anyhow, we've just got to be here, Jim!We owe it to ourselves
and our family."He's over to Gussie Pennock's, playing tennis," interposed Bessie,
with a pout."The mean old thing wouldn't ask me!""But you ain't old enough, my dear," soothed her aunt."Wait; your turn
will come by and by.""Yes, that's exactly it," triumphed the mother."Her turn WILL come--if
we live here.Do you suppose Fred would have got an invitation to
Gussie Pennock's if we'd still been living on the East Side?Pennock's worth fifty thousand, if he's worth a
dollar!"But, Hattie, money isn't everything, dear," remonstrated her husband
gently."We had friends, and good friends, before.""Yes; but you wait and see what kind of friends we have now!""But we can't keep up with such people, dear, on our income; and--"

"Ma, here's a man.It was a husky whisper
from Benny.Bessie Blaisdell and the little
dressmaker cocked their heads interestedly.Blaisdell rose to her
feet and advanced toward the steps to meet the man coming up the walk.He was a tall, rather slender man, with a close-cropped, sandy beard,
and an air of diffidence and apology.As he took off his hat and came
nearer, it was seen that his eyes were blue and friendly, and that his
hair was reddish-brown, and rather scanty on top of his head.James Blaisdell," he murmured
hesitatingly.Something in the stranger's deferential manner sent a warm glow of
importance to the woman's heart.Blaisdell was suddenly reminded
that she was Mrs.James D. Blaisdell of the West Side.Blaisdell," she replied a bit pompously."What can we do for
you, my good man?"She had never
called a person "my good man" before.The man on the steps coughed slightly behind his hand--a sudden
spasmodic little cough.Then very gravely he reached into his pocket
and produced a letter.Robert Chalmers--a note to your husband," he bowed,
presenting the letter.A look of gratified surprise came into the woman's face.Her husband, already on his feet, whisked the sheet of paper from the
unsealed envelope, and adjusted his glasses.A moment later he held out
a cordial hand to the stranger.I'm glad to see any friend of Bob
Chalmers'.My wife and children, and my sister,
Miss Blaisdell.(Glancing at the
open note in his hand.)Chalmers, of the First
National."Still with that deference
so delightfully heart-warming, the newcomer bowed low to the ladies,
and made his way to the offered chair."I will explain at once my
business," he said then.It was an eager question from Benny on the veranda
railing."Pa isn't anything, but ma's a Congregationalist."protested a duet of feminine voices softly; but the
stranger, apparently ignoring the interruption, continued speaking."I am gathering material for a book on the Blaisdell family."James Blaisdell, with cordial
interest."It is my purpose to remain some time in your
town.I am told there are valuable records here, and an old
burying-ground of particular interest in this connection.The
neighboring towns, too, have much Blaisdell data, I understand.As I
said, I am intending to make this place my headquarters, and I am
looking for an attractive boarding-place.Chalmers was good enough
to refer me to you.""To us--for a BOARDING-place!"James D. Blaisdell's countenance as she said the words."Well, I'm sure
I don't see why he should."But, Hattie, we could," interposed her husband eagerly."There's that
big front room that we don't need a bit.And it would help a lot if--"
At the wrathful warning in his wife's eyes he fell back silenced."I said that we didn't keep boarders," reiterated the lady distinctly."Furthermore, we do need the room ourselves.""Yes, yes, of course; I understand," broke in Mr.Smith, as if in hasty
conciliation.Chalmers meant that perhaps one of you"--he
glanced uncertainly at the anxious-eyed little woman at his
left--"might--er--accommodate me.Perhaps you, now--" He turned his
eyes full upon Miss Flora Blaisdell, and waited.Why, I live all alone--that is, I mean, I couldn't,
you know," she stammered confusedly."I dressmake, and I don't get any
sort of meals--not fit for a man, I mean.Just women's things--tea,
toast, and riz biscuit.I'm so fond of riz biscuit!But, of course,
you--" She came to an expressive pause."Oh, I could stand the biscuit, so long as they're not health biscuit,"
laughed Mr."You see, I've been living on those and hot
water quite long enough as it is.""Oh, ain't your health good, sir?"The little dressmaker's face wore
the deepest concern."Well, it's better than it was, thank you.I think I can promise to be
a good boarder, all right.""Why don't you go to a hotel?"James D. Blaisdell still spoke with
a slightly injured air."Oh, indeed, that would not do at all--for my purpose," he murmured."I
wish to be very quiet.I fear I should find it quite disturbing--the
noise and confusion of a public place like that.Besides, for my work,
it seemed eminently fitting, as well as remarkably convenient, if I
could make my home with one of the Blaisdell family."With a sudden exclamation the little dressmaker sat erect."Say, Harriet, how funny we never thought!He's just the one for poor
Maggie!She lives--"

"Your SISTER!"Smith's face had come a look of startled
surprise--a look almost of terror."But there weren't but three--that
is, I thought--I understood from Mr.Chalmers that there were but three
Blaisdells, two brothers, and one sister--you, yourself.""Oh, poor Maggie ain't a Blaisdell," explained the little dressmaker,
with a smile."She's just Maggie Duff, father Duff's daughter by his
first wife, you know.He married our mother years ago, when we children
were little, so we were brought up with Maggie, and always called her
sister; though, of course, she really ain't any relation to us at all."He appeared to be settling something in his mind."She
isn't a Blaisdell, then.""No, but she's so near like one, and she's a splendid cook, and---"

"Well, I shan't send him to Maggie," cut in Mrs.James D. Blaisdell
with emphasis."Poor Maggie's got quite enough on her hands, as it is,
with that father of hers.Besides, she isn't a Blaisdell at all.""And she couldn't come and cook and take care of us near so much,
either, could she," plunged in Benny, "if she took this man ter feed?""That will do, Benny," admonished his mother, with nettled dignity."You forget that children should be seen and not heard."But, please, can't I be heard just a minute for this?Why don't
ye send the man ter Uncle Frank an' Aunt Jane?cried Miss Flora Blaisdell."I wouldn't wonder a mite
if they did.""Yes, I was thinking of them," nodded her sister-in-law."And they're
always glad of a little help,--especially Jane."Only the heightened color in his wife's cheeks showed that she had
heard--and understood."Here, Benny," she directed, "go and show the gentleman where Uncle
Frank lives."With a spring the boy leaped to the lawn and pranced to
the sidewalk, dancing there on his toes.Blaisdell," he said, "and you, ladies.I shall hope
to see you again soon.I am sure you can help me, if you will, in my
work.We shall be glad to see you," promised his
host."Come any time, and ask all the questions you want to.""And we shall be so interested," fluttered Miss Flora."I've always
wanted to know about father's folks.And are you a Blaisdell, too?"Smith coughed again twice behind
his hand."Er--ah--oh, yes, I may say that I am.Through my mother I am descended
from the original immigrant, Ebenezer Blaisdell."James Blaisdell spoke the word as if her tongue
were a pair of tongs that had picked up a noxious viper."Yes, but not exactly as we commonly regard the term nowadays," smiled
Mr.Ebenezer Blaisdell was a man of means and distinction.He was the founder of the family in this country.murmured the little dressmaker, as the visitor
descended the steps.John Smith to
the assembled group on the veranda."And now, young man, I'm at your
service," he smiled, as he joined Benny, still prancing on the sidewalk."Now he's what I call a real nice pleasant-spoken gentleman," avowed
Miss Flora, when she thought speech was safe."I do hope Jane'll take
him.""Oh, yes, he's well enough," condescended Mrs.Hattie Blaisdell, with a
yawn."Hattie, why wouldn't you take him in?""Just
think how the pay would help!And it wouldn't be a bit of work, hardly,
for you.Certainly it would be a lot easier than the way we are doing."Do you suppose I got over here on the West Side to
open a boarding-house?"Perhaps if you'd worry a little more, I wouldn't worry so much,"
sighed the man deeply."Well, mercy me, I must be going," interposed the little dressmaker,
springing to her feet with a nervous glance at her brother and his
wife."I'm forgetting it ain't so near as it used to be.Come again," called the three on the veranda.Then the door closed behind them, as they entered the house.Meanwhile, walking across the common, Benny was entertaining Mr."Yep, they'll take ye, I bet ye--Aunt Jane an' Uncle Frank will!""Well, that's good, I'm sure."Why, Aunt Jane'll just tumble over
herself ter get ye, if ye just mention first what yer'll PAY.She'll
begin ter reckon up right away then what she'll save.An' in a minute
she'll say, 'Yes, I'll take ye.'"Smith's voice was palpable even to
eight-year-old Benny."Oh, you don't need ter worry," he hastened to explain."She won't
starve ye; only she won't let ye waste anythin'.You'll have ter eat
all the crusts to yer pie, and finish 'taters before you can get any
puddin', an' all that, ye know.Ye see, she's great on savin'--Aunt
Jane is.She says waste is a sinful extravagance before the Lord.""But are you sure, my
boy, that you ought to talk--just like this, about your aunt?""Why, that's all right, Mr.Ev'rybody in town knows Aunt Jane.Why, Ma says folks say she'd save ter-day for ter-morrer, if she could.But she couldn't do that, could she?But you
wait till you see Aunt Jane.""Well, ye won't have ter wait long, Mr.She lives over the groc'ry store, ter save rent, ye know.An' here we are," he finished, banging open a door and
leading the way up a flight of ill-lighted stairs.CHAPTER III

THE SMALL BOY AT THE KEYHOLE


At the top of the stairs Benny tried to open the door, but as it did
not give at his pressure, he knocked lustily, and called "Aunt Jane,
Aunt Jane!"Smith, his finger almost on a small
push-button near him."Yep, but it don't go now.Uncle Frank wanted it fixed, but Aunt Jane
said no; knockin' was just as good, an' 'twas lots cheaper, 'cause
'twould save mendin', and didn't use any 'lectricity.But Uncle Frank
says---"

The door opened abruptly, and Benny interrupted himself to give eager
greeting.Smith saw a tall, angular woman with graying
dark hair and high cheek bones.Her eyes were keen and just now
somewhat sternly inquiring, as they were bent upon himself.Perceiving that Benny considered his mission as master of ceremonies at
an end, Mr."I came from your husband's brother, madam.He thought
perhaps you had a room that I could have."Her eyes grew still more coldly disapproving.He thought--that is, THEY thought that perhaps--you
would be so kind."I
never have--but that isn't saying I couldn't, of course.As she finished speaking she stepped to the low-burning gas
jet and turned it carefully to give a little more light down the narrow
hallway.Benny had already reached the door at the end of the hall.The woman
began to tug at her apron strings."I hope you'll excuse my gingham apron, Mr.--er--Smith.Well, as I was saying, I hope
you'll excuse this apron."Her fingers were fumbling with the knot at
the back."I take it off, mostly, when the bell rings, evenings or
afternoons; but I heard Benny, and I didn't suppose 't was anybody but
him.With a jerk she switched off the dark blue
apron, hung it over her arm, and smoothed down the spotless white apron
which had been beneath the blue.The next instant she hurried after
Benny with a warning cry.Oh, Benny, you're
always in such a hurry!"Benny, with a cheery "Come on!"had already banged open the door before
him, and was reaching for the gas burner.A moment later the feeble spark above had become a flaring sputter of
flame."There, child, what did I tell you?"Blaisdell
reduced the flaring light to a moderate flame, and motioned Mr.Before she seated herself, however, she went back into the
hall to lower the gas there.During her momentary absence the man, Smith, looked about him, and as
he looked he pulled at his collar.He felt suddenly a choking,
suffocating sensation.He still had the curious feeling of trying to
catch his breath when the woman came back and took the chair facing
him.In a moment he knew why he felt so suffocated--it was because that
nowhere could he see an object that was not wholly or partially covered
with some other object, or that was not serving as a cover itself.The floor bore innumerable small rugs, one before each chair, each
door, and the fireplace.The chairs themselves, and the sofa, were
covered with gray linen slips, which, in turn, were protected by
numerous squares of lace and worsted of generous size.The green silk
spread on the piano was nearly hidden beneath a linen cover, and the
table showed a succession of layers of silk, worsted, and linen, topped
by crocheted mats, on which rested several books with paper-enveloped
covers.The chandelier, mirror, and picture frames gleamed dully from
behind the mesh of pink mosquito netting.Even through the doorway into
the hall might be seen the long, red-bordered white linen path that
carried protection to the carpet beneath.(With a start the man pulled himself
together to listen to what the woman was saying.)"I think it's a
foolish extravagance, when kerosene is so good and so cheap; but my
husband will have it, and Mellicent, too, in spite of anything I
say--Mellicent's my daughter.I tell 'em if we were rich, it would be
different, of course.But this is neither here nor there, nor what you
came to talk about!Now just what is it that you want, sir?""I want to board here, if I may.""A year--two years, perhaps, if we are mutually satisfied."Before he could catch his breath to answer
Benny had jumped into the breach."He sounds something like a Congregationalist, only he ain't that, Aunt
Jane, and he ain't after money for missionaries, either."Jane Blaisdell smiled at Benny indulgently."You know, Benny, very well, that nothing would suit Aunt Jane better
than to give money to all the missionaries in the world, if she only
had it to give!""You're
working for some church, then, I take it.""I am a genealogist, madam, in a small way.I am collecting data for a
book on the Blaisdell family."The look of cold disapproval
came back to her eyes.WE couldn't take the book,
I'm sure."That would not be necessary, madam, I assure you," murmured Mr."But how do you get money to live on?I mean, how am I to know that
I'll get my pay?""Excuse me, but that kind of business
doesn't sound very good-paying; and, you see, I don't know you.And in
these days--" An expressive pause finished her sentence.I had a letter of
introduction to your brother from Mr.I think he will
vouch for me."Oh, that's all right, then.But that isn't saying how MUCH you'll pay.Now, I think--"

There came a sharp knock at the outer door.The eager Benny jumped to
his feet, but his aunt shook her head and went to the door herself.There was a murmur of voices, then a young man entered the hall and sat
down in the chair near the hatrack.Blaisdell returned her
eyes were very bright."If you'll just excuse me a minute," she apologized to Mr.Smith, as
she swept by him and opened a door across the room, nearly closing it
behind her.Distinctly then, from beyond the imperfectly closed door, came to the
ears of Benny and Mr.Blaisdell's most
excited accents:--"Mellicent, it's Carl Pennock.He wants you to go
auto-riding with him down to the Lake with Katie Moore and that crowd."Smith did not hear, for a nearer, yet more excited,
voice demanded attention.Won't my sister
Bess be mad?She thinks Carl Pennock's the cutest thing going.and an expressive glance toward the hall, Mr.Smith tried to stop further revelations; but Benny was not to be
silenced."They're rich--awful rich--the Pennocks are," he confided still more
huskily."An' there's a girl--Gussie.He's seventeen; an' Bess is mad 'cause she isn't
seventeen, too, so she can go an' play tennis same as Fred does.She'll
be madder 'n ever now, if Mell goes auto-riding with Carl, an'--"

"Sh-h!"Smith's voice and gesture this time that
Benny fell back subdued.At once then became distinctly audible again the voices from the other
room.Smith, forced to hear in spite of himself, had the air of one
who finds he has abandoned the frying pan for the fire."No, dear, it's quite out of the question," came from beyond the door,
in Mrs."I can't let you wear your pink.You will
wear the blue or stay at home."But, mother, dear, it's all out of date," wailed a young girl's voice.It's perfectly whole and neat, and you must save
the pink for best.""But I'm always saving things for best, mother, and I never wear my
best.I never wear a thing when it's in style!By the time you let me
wear the pink I shan't want to wear it.Sleeves'll be small then--you
see if they aren't--I shall be wearing big ones.I want to wear big
ones now, when other girls do."Mellicent, why will you tease me like this, when you know it will do
no good?--when you know I can't let you do it?Don't you think I want
you to be as well-dressed as anybody, if we could afford it?You must wear the blue or stay at home.There was a pause, then there came an inarticulate word and a choking
half-sob.The pink spots in her cheeks had deepened.She shut the door firmly,
then hurried through the room to the hall beyond.Another minute and
she was back in her chair."I'm ready now to talk business, Mr.She stated plainly what she expected to do for
her boarder, and what she expected her boarder would do for her.She
enlarged upon the advantages and minimized the discomforts, with the
aid of a word now and then from the eager and interested Benny.Smith, on his part, had little to say.That that little was most
satisfactory, however, was very evident; for Mrs.Blaisdell was soon
quite glowing with pride and pleasure.He
was plainly ill at ease, and, at times, slightly abstracted.His eyes
frequently sought the door which Mrs.Blaisdell had closed so firmly a
short time before.They were still turned in that direction when
suddenly the door opened and a young girl appeared.She was a slim little girl with long-lashed, starlike eyes and a
wild-rose flush in her cheeks.Beneath her trim hat her light brown
hair waved softly over her ears, glinting into gold where the light
struck it.She looked excited and pleased, yet not quite happy.She
wore a blue dress, plainly made.Be in before ten, dear," cautioned Mrs."And Mellicent, just a minute, dear.He's coming here to live--to board, you know.Smith, already on his feet, bowed and murmured a conventional
something.From the starlike eyes he received a fleeting glance that
made him suddenly conscious of his fifty years and the bald spot on the
top of his head.Then the girl was gone, and her mother was speaking
again."She's going auto-riding--Mellicent is--with a young man, Carl
Pennock--one of the nicest in town.They're going down to the Lake for cake and ice cream, and they're all
nice young people, else I shouldn't let her go, of course.She's
eighteen, for all she's so small.She favors my mother in looks, but
she's got the Blaisdell nose, though.Oh, and 'twas the Blaisdells you
said you were writing a book about, wasn't it?You don't mean OUR
Blaisdells, right here in Hillerton?""I mean all Blaisdells, wherever I find them," smiled Mr.Now that the matter
of board had been satisfactorily settled, Mrs.Blaisdell apparently
dared to show some interest in the book.My, how pleased Hattie'll be--my sister-in-law, Jim's
wife.She just loves to see her name in print--parties, and club
banquets, and where she pours, you know.But maybe you don't take
women, too.""Oh, yes, if they are Blaisdells, or have married Blaisdells."That's where we'd come in, then, isn't it?And
Frank, my husband, he'll like it, too,--if you tell about the grocery
store.And of course you would, if you told about him.You'd have
to--'cause that's all there is to tell.He thinks that's about all
there is in the world, anyway,--that grocery store.And 'tis a good
store, if I do say it.And there's his sister, Flora; and Maggie--But,
there!She won't be in it, will she, after all?She isn't
a Blaisdell, and she didn't marry one."She'll just laugh
and say it doesn't matter; and then Grandpa Duff'll ask for his drops
or his glasses, or something, and she'll forget all about it."Yes, I know; but--Poor Maggie!Blaisdell
sighed and looked thoughtful."But Maggie KNOWS a lot about the
Blaisdells," she added, brightening; "so she could tell you lots of
things--about when they were little, and all that."But--that isn't--er--" Mr."And, really, for that matter, she knows about us NOW, too, better than
'most anybody else.Hattie's always sending for her, and Flora, too, if
they're sick, or anything.Sometimes I think they actually
impose upon her.And she's such a good soul, too!I declare, I never
see her but I wish I could do something for her.But, of course, with
my means--But, there!Frank says I
never do know when to stop, when I get started on something; and of
course you didn't come here to talk about poor Maggie.When is it you want to start in--to board, I mean?""And now we must be going--Benny and I. I'm at the Holland House.Blaisdell, I'll send up my trunks to-morrow
morning.And now good-night--and thank you."The woman, too, came to her feet, but her face
was surprised."Why, you haven't even seen your room yet!How do you
know you'll like it?"There was a quizzical lift to his
eyebrows.Well--er--perhaps I will just take a look at--the room, though I'm not
worrying any, I assure you.I've no doubt it will be quite right, quite
right," he finished, as he followed Mrs.Blaisdell to a door halfway
down the narrow hall.Five minutes later, once more on the street, he was walking home with
Benny.It was Benny who broke the long silence that had immediately
fallen between them.Smith, I'll bet ye YOU'll never be rich!"I'll never be--What do you mean, boy?""'Cause you paid Aunt Jane what she asked the very first time.Why,
Aunt Jane never expects ter get what she asks, pa says.She sells him
groceries in the store, sometimes, when Uncle Frank's away, ye know.Pa
says what she asks first is for practice--just ter get her hand in; an'
she expects ter get beat down.But you paid it, right off the bat.Didn't ye see how tickled Aunt Jane was, after she'd got over bein'
surprised?""Why--er--really, Benny," murmured Mr."Oh, yes, sir, you could have saved a lot every week, if ye hadn't bit
so quick.An' that's why I say you won't ever get rich.Savin''s what
does it, ye know--gets folks rich.She says a penny
saved's good as two earned, an' better than four spent.""That does look as
if there wasn't much chance for me, doesn't it?"Benny spoke soberly, and with evident sympathy.He spoke
again, after a moment, but Mr.Smith was, indeed, not a little abstracted all the way to Benny's home,
though his good-night was very cheerful at parting.Benny would have
been surprised, indeed, had he known that Mr.Smith was thinking, not
about his foolishly extravagant agreement for board, but about a pair
of starry eyes with wistful lights in them, and a blue dress, plainly
made.John Smith wrote the following letter to
Edward D. Norton, Esq., Chicago:

MY DEAR NED,--Well, I'm here.I've been here exactly six hours, and
already I'm in possession of not a little Blaisdell data for
my--er--book.James, their daughter, Bessie, and
their son, Benny.Benny, by the way, is a gushing geyser of current
Blaisdell data which, I foresee, I shall find interesting, but
embarrassing, perhaps, at times.I've also seen Miss Flora, and Mrs.Jane Blaisdell and her daughter, Mellicent.There's a "Poor Maggie" whom I haven't seen.But she isn't a Blaisdell.She's a Duff, daughter of the man who married Rufus Blaisdell's widow,
some thirty years or more ago.As I said, I haven't seen her yet, but
she, too, according to Mrs.Frank Blaisdell, must be a gushing geyser
of Blaisdell data, so I probably soon shall see her.Why she's "poor" I
don't know.As for the Blaisdell data already in my possession--I've no comment to
make.Really, Ned, to tell the truth, I'm not sure I'm going to relish
this job, after all.In spite of a perfectly clear conscience, and the
virtuous realization that I'm here to bring nothing worse than a
hundred thousand dollars apiece with the possible addition of a few
millions on their devoted heads--in spite of all this, I yet have an
uncomfortable feeling that I'm a small boy listening at the keyhole.However, I'm committed to the thing now, so I'll stuff it out, I
suppose,--though I'm not sure, after all, that I wouldn't chuck the
whole thing if it wasn't that I wanted to see how Mellicent will enjoy
her pink dresses.How many pink dresses will a hundred thousand dollars
buy, anyway,--I mean PRETTY pink dresses, all fixed up with frills and
furbelows?As ever yours,

STAN--er--JOHN SMITH.CHAPTER IV

IN SEARCH OF SOME DATES


Very promptly the next morning Mr.John Smith and his two trunks
appeared at the door of his new boarding-place.Jane Blaisdell
welcomed him cordially.She wore a high-necked, long-sleeved gingham
apron this time, which she neither removed nor apologized for--unless
her cheerful "You see, mornings you'll find me in working trim, Mr.Mellicent, her slender young self enveloped in a similar apron, was
dusting his room as he entered it.She nodded absently, with a casual
"Good-morning, Mr.Even the
placing of the two big trunks, which the shuffling men brought in, won
from her only a listless glance or two.Then, without speaking again,
she left the room, as her mother entered it.Blaisdell looked about her complacently."With this
couch-bed with its red cover and cushions, and all the dressing things
moved to the little room in there, it looks like a real sitting-room in
here, doesn't it?""And you had 'em take the trunks in there, too.That's good," she
nodded, crossing to the door of the small dressing-room beyond.Well, I hope you'll be real happy with us, Mr.And you needn't be a mite afraid of
hurting anything.I've covered everything with mats and tidies and
spreads."A keen listener would have noticed an odd something in
Mr."Yes, I always do--to save wearing and soiling, you know.Of course, if
we had money to buy new all the time, it would be different.And that's what I tell Mellicent when she complains of so many
things to dust and brush.Dinner's at twelve o'clock, and supper is at six--except in the winter.We have it earlier then, so's we can go to bed earlier.I do like the long days, don't you?Well,
I'll be off now, and let you unpack.As I said before, make yourself
perfectly at home, perfectly at home."Smith drew a long breath and looked about him.It was a
pleasant room, in spite of its cluttered appearance.There was an
old-fashioned desk for his papers, and the chairs looked roomy and
comfortable.The little dressing-room carried many conveniences, and
the windows of both rooms looked out upon the green of the common."Oh, well, I don't know.This might be lots worse--in spite of the
tidies!"John Smith, as he singled out the keys of his
trunks.He was a
portly man with rather thick gray hair and "mutton-chop" gray whiskers.He ate very fast, and a great deal, yet he still found time to talk
interestedly with his new boarder.He was plainly a man of decided opinions--opinions which he did not
hesitate to express, and which he emphasized with resounding thumps of
his fists on the table.Smith, taken
utterly by surprise, was guilty of a visible start.After that he
learned to accept them with the serenity evinced by the rest of the
family.Smith knew (if he could remember them)
the current market prices of beans, corn, potatoes, sugar, and flour;
and he knew (again if he could remember) why some of these commodities
were higher, and some lower, than they had been the week before.That stocks and bonds fluctuated,
he was well aware.That "wheat" could be cornered, he realized.But of
the ups and downs of corn and beans as seen by the retail grocer he
knew very little.That is, he had known very little until after that
dinner with Mr.Smith began systematically to gather
material for his Blaisdell book.He would first visit by turns all the
Hillerton Blaisdells, he decided; then, when he had exhausted their
resources, he would, of course, turn to the town records and cemeteries
of Hillerton and the neighboring villages.Armed with a pencil and a very businesslike looking notebook,
therefore, he started at two o'clock for the home of James Blaisdell.Blaisdell's kind permission to come and ask all the
questions he liked, he deemed it fitting to begin there.He had no trouble in finding the house, but there was no one in sight
this time, as he ascended the steps.The house, indeed, seemed
strangely quiet.He was just about to ring the bell when around the
corner of the veranda came a hurried step and a warning voice."Oh, please, don't ring the bell!Isn't it something that I
can do for you?"He thought at first, from the trim, slender
figure, and the waving hair above the gracefully poised head, that he
was confronting a young woman.Then he saw the silver threads at the
temples, and the fine lines about the eyes.James Blaisdell," he answered,
lifting his hat.She smiled brightly, then
went on before he could reply.I fancy I should be edified to hear
it--that description."Then, a bit roguishly, she demanded:--"Should you
like to hear it--really?"I've already collected a few samples of Benny's
descriptive powers."She motioned him
to a chair, and dropped easily into one herself."Benny said you were
tall and not fat; that you had a wreath of light hair 'round a bald
spot, and whiskers that were clipped as even as Mr.Pennock's hedge;
and that your lips, without speaking, said, 'Run away, little boy,' but
that your eyes said, 'Come here.'"So I judge, since you recognized me without any difficulty," rejoined
Mr.You see you have the advantage of
me."Oh, I'm just here to help out.Blaisdell is ill upstairs--one of
her headaches.That is why I asked you not to ring.She gets so nervous
when the bell rings.She thinks it's callers, and that she won't be
ready to receive them; and she hurries up and begins to dress.So I
asked you not to ring.""Oh, for the book, of course.Oh, yes, I have heard about that, too."Blaisdell will soon
be here.He's coming early so I can go home."And you are--"

"Miss Duff."You don't mean--'Poor Maggie'!"(Not until the words were out did Mr."Er--ah--that is--" He
stumbled miserably, and she came to his rescue."Oh, yes, I'm--'Poor Maggie.'"There was an odd something in her
expressive face that Mr.He was groping for
something--anything to say, when suddenly there was a sound behind
them, and the little woman at his side sprang to her feet."Oh, Hattie, you came down!"James Blaisdell
opened the screen door and stepped out on to the veranda.Blaisdell advanced and held out her hand.She looked pale, and her hair
hung a bit untidily about one ear below a somewhat twisted pyramid of
puffs.Her dress, though manifestly an expensive one, showed haste in
its fastenings."Yes, I heard voices, and I thought some one had
come--a caller."I'm glad--if you're better," smiled Miss Maggie."Then I'll go, if you
don't mind.Smith has come to ask you some questions, Hattie.With another cheery smile and a nod to Mr.Smith, she
disappeared into the house.Smith saw her hurrying
down a side path to the street.Blaisdell sank languidly into
a chair."About the Blaisdell family--yes.But perhaps another day, when you are
feeling better, Mrs."I can answer to-day as
well as any time--though I'm not sure I can tell you very much, ever.I
think it's fine you are making the book, though.Some way it gives a
family such a standing, to be written up like that.And the Blaisdells are really a very nice family--one of the oldest in
Hillerton, though, of course, they haven't much money.""I ought to find a good deal of material here, then, if they have lived
here so long."Of course I can tell you
about my own family.You
knew that, didn't you?His
picture was in it a year ago last June.There was a write-up on
Hillerton.I was in it, too, though there wasn't much about me.But
I've got other clippings with more, if you'd like to see them--where
I've poured, and been hostess, and all that, you know."Blaisdell, your husband's father's name was Rufus, I
believe.What was his mother's maiden name, please?"Our little girl is named
for her--Bessie, you know--you saw her last night.Jim wanted to, so I
let him.It's a pretty name--Elizabeth--still, it sounds a little
old-fashioned now, don't you think?Of course we are anxious to have
everything just right for our daughter.A young lady soon coming out,
so,--you can't be too particular.That's one reason why I wanted to get
over here--on the West Side, I mean.Everybody who is anybody lives on
the West Side in Hillerton.And your mother Blaisdell's surname?"Smith's
pencil was poised over the open notebook.But,
dear me, I don't know.I suppose Jim will, or Flora, or maybe
Frank--though I don't believe HE will, unless her folks kept groceries.Did you ever see anybody that didn't know anything but groceries like
Frank Blaisdell?"The lady sighed and shrugged her somewhat heavy
shoulders with an expressive glance."Oh, well, it's good--to be interested in one's business, you know."murmured the lady, with another shrug.Rufus Blaisdell's surname?"But Jim--Oh, I'll tell you who will know," she broke off
interestedly; "and that's Maggie Duff.You saw her here a few minutes
ago, you know.Father Duff's got all of Mother Blaisdell's papers and
diaries.Oh, Maggie can tell you a lot of things.Benny
says if we want ANYTHING we ask Aunt Maggie, and I don't know but he's
right.And here I am, sending you to her, so soon!""I don't see but what I shall have
to interview Miss Maggie, and Miss Flora.Is there nothing more, then,
that you can tell me?""Well, there's Fred, my son.He's at the head of his class, and he's going to college and
be a lawyer.And that's another reason why I wanted to come over to
this side--on Fred's account.I want him to meet the right sort of
people.We think we're going to have Fred a
big man some day."Smith's pencil still poised above an
almost entirely blank page.He'll be eighteen the tenth of next month.""And Miss Bessie, and Benny?"She wants to come
out then, but I think I shall wait--a little, she's so very young;
though Gussie Pennock's out, and she's only seventeen, and the Pennocks
are some of our very best people.They're the richest folks in town,
you know.""He's eight--or rather nine, next Tuesday.Smith, don't
you want ANYTHING but dates?They're tiresome things, I think,--make
one feel so old, you know, and it shows up how many years you've been
married.Well, you miss a lot, of course,--home and wife and
children.You aren't tied down, and you
don't have so much to worry about.Is your mother living, or your
father?"Smith stirred a little uneasily,
and adjusted his book.Blaisdell, you can give me
your own maiden name.""Oh, yes, I can give you that!"She laughed and bridled
self-consciously."But you needn't ask when I was born, for I shan't
tell you, if you do.And the Snows were just as good as the Blaisdells,
if I do say it.There were a lot that wanted me--oh, I was pretty THEN,
Mr.She laughed, and bridled again self-consciously.He was handsome then, very--big dark eyes and dark hair, and
so dreamy and poetical-looking; and there wasn't a girl that hadn't set
her cap for him.And he's been a good husband to me.To be sure, he
isn't quite so ambitious as he might be, perhaps._I_ always did
believe in being somebody, and getting somewhere.But
Jim--he's always for hanging back and saying how much it'll cost.Ten
to one he doesn't end up by saying we can't afford it.He's like
Jane,--Frank's wife, where you board, you know,--only Jane's worse than
Jim ever thought of being.She won't spend even what she's got.If
she's got ten dollars, she won't spend but five cents, if she can help
it.Now, I believe in taking some comfort as you go along.But
Jane--greatest saver I ever did see.Smith, that
she doesn't try to save feeding you at all!"Smith smiled cheerily, snapped his book shut
and got to his feet."Oh, won't you wait for Mr.He can tell you more, I'm sure."At his office, some time, I'll see Mr."But I thank you
very much, Mrs.Blaisdell," he bowed in farewell.CHAPTER V

IN MISS FLORA'S ALBUM


It was the next afternoon that Mr.Smith inquired his way to the home
of Miss Flora Blaisdell.He found it to be a shabby little cottage on a
side street.Miss Flora herself answered his knock, peering at him
anxiously with her near-sighted eyes."Good-afternoon, Miss Blaisdell," he began with a deferential bow."I
am wondering if you could tell me something of your father's family."Miss Flora, plainly pleased, but flustered, stepped back for him to
enter.I'm sure I'm glad to tell you
anything I know," she beamed, ushering him into the unmistakably
little-used "front room.""But you really ought to go to Maggie.I can
tell you some things, but Maggie's got the Bible.Mother had it, you
know, and it's all among her things.And of course we had to let it
stay, as long as Father Duff lives.Poor Maggie--she tried to get 'em for us; but, mercy!I've got pictures of a lot of them,
and most of them I know quite a lot about."As she spoke she nicked up from the table a big red plush photograph
album.Seating herself at his side she opened it, and began to tell him
of the pictures, one by one.She did, indeed, know "quite a lot" of most of them.Tintypes,
portraying stiffly held hands and staring eyes, ghostly reproductions
of daguerreotypes of stern-lipped men and women, in old-time stock and
kerchief; photographs of stilted family groups after the
"he-is-mine-and-I-am-his" variety; snap-shots of adorable babies with
blurred thumbs and noses--never had Mr.Busily, from time to time, he jotted down a name
or date.Then, suddenly, as she turned a page, he gave an involuntary
start.He was looking at a pictured face, evidently cut from a magazine."Why, what--who--" he stammered.Miss Flora's
hands fluttered over the page a little importantly, adjusting a corner
of the print.I can't tell you just how, only I know he
is.That's why I've always been so
interested in him, and read everything I could--in the papers and
magazines, you know."John Smith's voice had become a little uncertain.Miss Flora's eyes were musingly
fixed on the picture before her--which was well, perhaps: Mr.John
Smith's face was a study just then."Er--n-no, he isn't.""But he's turribly rich, I s'pose.I wonder how it feels to have so
much money."There being no reply to this, Miss Flora went on after a moment."It must be awful nice--to buy what you want, I mean, without fretting
about how much it costs."What would you do--if you could--if you had the money, I mean?""Well, there's three things I know I'd do.They're silly, of course,
but they're what I WANT.It's a phonygraph, and to see Niagara Falls,
and to go into Noell's restaurant and order what I want without even
looking at the prices after 'em."What's more, I hope you'll get them--some time."Why, if I had the money, I shouldn't
spend it--not for them things.I'd be needing shoes or a new dress.And
I COULDN'T be so rich I wouldn't notice what the prices was--of what I
ate.But, then, I don't believe anybody's that, not even him."She
pointed to the picture still open before them.Smith, his eyes bent upon the picture, was looking
thoughtful.He had the air of a man to whom has come a brand-new,
somewhat disconcerting idea.Miss Flora, glancing from the man to the picture, and back again, gave
a sudden exclamation."There, now I know who it is that you remind me of, Mr.Miss Flora was still interestedly
comparing the man and the picture, "But, then, that ain't so strange.Didn't you say you was a Blaisdell?""Er--y-yes, oh, yes.I'm a Blaisdell," nodded Mr."Very
likely I've got the--er--Blaisdell nose.Then he turned a leaf of
the album abruptly, decidedly.he demanded,
pointing to the tintype of a bright-faced young girl.Oh, that's my cousin Grace when she was sixteen.She died; but
she was a wonderful girl.Smith; and even the closest observer, watching his
face, could not have said that he was not absorbedly interested in Miss
Flora's story of "my cousin Grace."It was not until the last leaf of the album was reached that they came
upon the picture of a small girl, with big, hungry eyes looking out
from beneath long lashes."That's Mellicent--where you're boarding, you know--when she was
little.""But it's horrid, poor
child!""But she looks so--so sad," murmured Mr.She
hesitated, then burst out, as if irresistibly impelled from within."It's only just another case of never having what you want WHEN you
want it, Mr.And it ain't 'cause they're poor, either.They
AIN'T poor--not like me, I mean.Frank's always done well, and he's
been a good provider; but it's my sister-in-law--her way, I mean.Not
that I'm saying anything against Jane.She's a good woman, and
she's very kind to me.She's always saying what she'd do for me if she
only had the money.She's a good housekeeper, too, and her house is as
neat as wax.But it's just that she never thinks she can USE anything
she's got till it's so out of date she don't want it.I dressmake for
her, you see, so I know--about her sleeves and skirts, you know.And if
she ever does wear a decent thing she's so afraid it will rain she
never takes any comfort in it!""Well, that is--unfortunate."And she's brought up that poor child the same way.Why,
from babyhood, Mellicent never had her rattles till she wanted blocks,
nor her blocks till she wanted dolls, nor her dolls till she was big
enough for beaus!And that's what made the poor child always look so
wall-eyed and hungry.She was hungry--even if she did get enough to
eat."Blaisdell probably believed in--er--economy," hazarded Mr.But, there, I ought not to
have said anything, of course.I only wish some
other folks I could mention had more of it.There's Jim's wife, for
instance.Now, if she's got ten cents, she'll spend fifteen--and five
more to show HOW she spent it.She and Jane ought to be shaken up in a
bag together.Smith, Jane doesn't let herself enjoy anything.She's always keeping it for a better time.Though sometimes I think she
DOES enjoy just seeing how far she can make a dollar go.But Mellicent
don't, nor Frank; and it's hard on them."Smith was looking at the wistful eyes
under the long lashes."'T is; and 't ain't right, I believe.There IS such a thing as being
too economical.I tell Jane she'll be like a story I read once about a
man who pinched and saved all his life, not even buying peanuts, though
he just doted on 'em.And when he did get rich, so he could buy the
peanuts, he bought a big bag the first thing.He
hadn't got any teeth left to chew 'em with."Smith, as he pocketed his
notebook and rose to his feet."And now I thank you very much, Miss
Blaisdell, for the help you've been to me.""Oh, you're quite welcome, indeed you are, Mr.Smith," beamed Miss
Blaisdell."It's done me good, just to talk to you about all these
folks and pictures.I do get lonesome sometimes, all
alone, so!and I ain't so busy as I wish I was, always.But I'm afraid
I haven't helped you much--just this.""Oh, yes, you have--perhaps more than think," smiled the man, with an
odd look in his eyes.Well, I'm glad, I'm sure.And don't forget to go to Maggie's,
now.And she'll be so glad
to show you!""All right, thank you; I'll surely interview--Miss Maggie," smiled the
man in good-bye.He had almost said "poor" Maggie himself, though why she should be POOR
Maggie had come to be an all-absorbing question with him.He had been
tempted once to ask Miss Flora, but something had held him back.That
evening at the supper table, however, in talking with Mrs.Jane
Blaisdell, the question came again to his lips; and this time it found
utterance.Jane herself had introduced Miss Maggie's name, and had said an
inconsequential something about her when Mr.Blaisdell, please,--may I ask?I must confess to a great
curiosity as to why Miss Duff is always 'poor Maggie.'""Why, really, I don't know," she answered, "only it just comes natural,
that's all.I did it again,
didn't I?That only goes to show how we all do it, unconsciously."Frank Blaisdell, across the table, gave a sudden emphatic sniff.Well, I guess if you had to live with Father Duff, Jane, it
would be 'poor Jane' with you, all right!""Father Duff's a trial, and no mistake.Aunt Maggie's a saint--that's what she is!"It was Mellicent who
spoke, her young voice vibrant with suppressed feeling."She's the
dearest thing ever!There COULDN'T be anybody better than Aunt Maggie!"Nothing more was said just then, but in the evening, later, after
Mellicent had gone to walk with young Pennock, and her father had gone
back down to the store, Mrs.Blaisdell took up the matter of "Poor
Maggie" again."I've been thinking what you said," she began, "about our calling her
'poor Maggie,' and I've made up my mind it's because we're all so sorry
for her.You see, she's been so unfortunate, as I said.I've so often wished there was something I could do for her.Of course,
if we only had money--but we haven't; so I can't.And even money
wouldn't take away her father, either.I didn't mean that,
really,--not the way it sounded," broke off Mrs.Blaisdell, in shocked
apology."I only meant that she'd have her father to care for, just the
same.""He's something of a trial, I take it, eh?"How ever she endures it, I
can't imagine.Of course, we call him Father Duff, but he's really not
any relation to us--I mean to Frank and the rest.But their mother
married him when they were children, and they never knew their own
father much, so he's the father they know.When their mother died,
Maggie had just entered college.She was eighteen, and such a pretty
girl!"Well, of course Maggie had to come home right away.None of the rest
wanted to take care of him and Maggie had to.There was another Duff
sister then--a married sister (she's died since), but SHE wouldn't take
him, so Maggie had to.Of course, none of the Blaisdells wanted the
care of him--and he wasn't their father, anyway.Frank was wanting to
marry me, and Jim and Flora were in school and wanted to stay there, of
course.She was so
ambitious, and so fond of books.But she came, and went right into the
home and kept it so Frank and Jim and Flora could live there just the
same as when their mother was alive.And she had to do all the work,
too.Kind of hard, wasn't it?--and
Maggie only eighteen!"Smith's lips came together a bit grimly."Well, after a time Frank and Jim married, and there was only Flora and
Father Duff at home.Poor Maggie tried then to go to college again.She
was over twenty-one, and supposed to be her own mistress, of course.She found a place where she could work and pay her way through college,
and Flora said she'd keep the house and take care of Father Duff.But,
dear me; it wasn't a month before that ended, and Maggie had to come
home again.Flora wasn't strong, and the work fretted her.Besides, she
never could get along with Father Duff, and she was trying to learn
dressmaking, too.She stuck it out till she got sick, though, then of
course Maggie had to come back."She
persuaded her father to get a girl.The
first girl and her father fought like cats and dogs, and the last time
she got one her father was taken sick, and again she had to come home.Some way, it's always been that way with poor Maggie.No sooner does
she reach out to take something than it's snatched away, just as she
thinks she's got it.Why, there was her father's cousin George--he was
going to help her once.But a streak of bad luck hit him at just that
minute, and he gave out."He's done
well, too, they say, and I always thought he'd send back something; but
he never has.There was some trouble, I believe, between him and Father
Duff at the time he went to Alaska, so that explains it, probably.Anyway, he's never done anything for them.Well, when he gave out,
Maggie just gave up college then, and settled down to take care of her
father, though I guess she's always studied some at home; and I know
that for years she didn't give up hope but that she could go some time."Why, let me see--forty-three, forty-four--yes, she's forty-five.She
had her forty-third birthday here--I remember I gave her a handkerchief
for a birthday present--when she was helping me take care of Mellicent
through the pneumonia; and that was two years ago.She used to come
here and to Jim's and Flora's days at a time; but she isn't quite so
free as she was--Father Duff's worse now, and she don't like to leave
him nights, much, so she can't come to us so often."And
just what is the matter with Mr.Jane Blaisdell gave a short laugh and shrugged her
shoulders."Everything's the matter--with Father Duff!Oh, it's nerves,
mostly, the doctor says, and there are some other things--long names
that I can't remember.But, as I said, everything's the matter with
Father Duff.He's one of those men where there isn't anything quite
right.Frank says he's got so he just objects to everything--on general
principles.If it's blue, he says it ought to be black, you know.And,
really, I don't know but Frank's right.How Maggie stands him I don't
see; but she's devotion itself.Why, she even gave up her lover years
ago, for him.She wouldn't leave her father, and, of course, nobody
would think of taking HIM into the family, when he wasn't BORN into it,
so the affair was broken off.I don't know, really, as Maggie cared
much.She never was one to carry her heart on
her sleeve.I've always so wished I could do something for
her!But, then, you asked, and you're interested,
I know, and that's what you're here for--to find out about the
Blaisdells.""To--to--f-find out--" stammered Mr."Yes, for your book, I mean.""Oh, yes--of course; for my book," agreed Mr.He
had the guilty air of a small boy who has almost been caught in a raid
on the cooky jar."And although poor Maggie isn't really a Blaisdell herself, she's
nearly one; and they've got lots of Blaisdell records down there--among
Mother Blaisdell's things, you know.I'll want to see those, of course," declared Mr.Smith, rising to his feet, preparatory to going to his own room.CHAPTER VI

POOR MAGGIE


It was some days later that Mr.Smith asked Benny one afternoon to show
him the way to Miss Maggie Duff's home."Sure I will," agreed Benny with alacrity."You don't ever have ter do
any teasin' ter get me ter go ter Aunt Maggie's.""You're fond of Aunt Maggie, then, I take it."Why, I don't know
anybody that don't like Aunt Maggie.""I'm sure that speaks well--for Aunt Maggie," smiled Mr.A feller can take some comfort at Aunt Maggie's," continued
Benny, trudging along at Mr."She don't have anythin'
just for show, that you can't touch, like 'tis at my house, and there
ain't anythin' but what you can use without gettin' snarled up in a
mess of covers an' tidies, like 'tis at Aunt Jane's.But Aunt Maggie
don't save anythin', Aunt Jane says, an' she'll die some day in the
poor-house, bein' so extravagant."Well, really, Benny, I--er--" hesitated the man."Well, I don't believe she will," repeated Benny."I hope she won't,
anyhow.Poorhouses ain't very nice, are they?""I--I don't think I know very much about them, Benny.""Well, I don't believe they are, from what Aunt Jane says.And if they
ain't, I don't want Aunt Maggie ter go.She hadn't ought ter have
anythin'--but Heaven--after Grandpa Duff.He's got a chronic grouch, ma says.It means it keeps goin' without stoppin'--the rheumatism, I
mean, not the folks that's got it.THEY don't go at all, sometimes.Cole don't, and that's what he's got.But when I asked ma what a
grouch was, she said little boys should be seen and not heard.Ma
always says that when she don't want to answer my questions."Oh, are you POOR, too?"Well, that is, I--I--"

"Ma was wonderin' yesterday what you lived on.Haven't you got any
money, Mr."Oh, yes, Benny, I've got money enough--to live on."Smith spoke
promptly, and with confidence this time.You're glad, then, ain't you?Ma says we haven't--got
enough ter live on, I mean; but pa says we have, if we didn't try ter
live like everybody else lives what's got more."Smith bit his lip, and looked down a little apprehensively at the
small boy at his side."I--I'm not sure, Benny, but _I_ shall have to say little boys should
be seen and not--" He stopped abruptly.Benny, with a stentorian shout,
had run ahead to a gate before a small white cottage.On the cozy,
vine-shaded porch sat a white-haired old man leaning forward on his
cane."Hi, there, Grandpa Duff, I've brought somebody ter see ye!"The gate
was open now, and Benny was halfway up the short walk.Smith doffed his hat and came forward.The man on the porch looked up sharply from beneath heavy brows.Smith, on the topmost step, hesitated."Is
your--er--daughter in, Mr.His somewhat unfriendly gaze was still bent
upon the newcomer."Just what do you want of my daughter?""Why, I--I--" Plainly nonplused, the man paused uncertainly.Then, with
a resumption of his jaunty cheerfulness, he smiled straight into the
unfriendly eyes.Duff,--records of the
Blaisdell family.I'm compiling a book on--

"Humph!Duff curtly, settling back
in his chair."As I said, I've heard of you.But you needn't come here
asking your silly questions.I shan't tell you a thing, anyway, if you
do.It's none of your business who lived and died and what they did
before you were born.If the Lord had wanted you to know he'd 'a' put
you here then instead of now!"Looking very much as if he had received a blow in the face, Mr."Aw, grandpa"--began Benny, in grieved expostulation.But a cheery
voice interrupted, and Mr.Smith turned to see Miss Maggie Duff
emerging from the doorway.she greeted him, extending a cordial
hand.For only the briefest of minutes he hesitated.Could she
have heard, and yet speak so unconcernedly?And
yet--He took the chair she offered--but with a furtive glance toward
the old man.Smith tells me he has come to see those records.Now, I'm--"

"Oh, father, dear, you couldn't!"interrupted his daughter with
admonishing earnestness."You mustn't go and get all those down!"Smith almost gasped aloud in his amazement, but Miss Maggie did not
seem to notice him at all.)"Why, father, you couldn't--they're too
heavy for you!There are the Bible, and all those papers.Besides, I shouldn't think you'd want
to get them!"Smith, hearing this, almost gasped aloud in his amazement, he
quite did so at what happened next.His mouth actually fell open as he
saw the old man rise to his feet with stern dignity.I'm not quite in my dotage yet.I guess I'm
still able to fetch downstairs a book and a bundle of papers."With his
thumping cane a resolute emphasis to every other step, the old man
hobbled into the house."There, grandpa, that's the talk!""But you said--"

"Er--Benny, dear," interposed Miss Maggie, in a haste so precipitate
that it looked almost like alarm, "run into the pantry and see what you
can find in the cooky jar."The last of her sentence was addressed to
Benny's flying heels as they disappeared through the doorway.Smith searched the woman's face for some hint, some
sign that this extraordinary shift-about was recognized and understood;
but Miss Maggie, with a countenance serenely expressing only cheerful
interest, was over by the little stand, rearranging the pile of books
and newspapers on it."I think, after all," she began thoughtfully, pausing in her work,
"that it will be better indoors.It blows so out here that you'll be
bothered in your copying, I am afraid."She was still standing at the table, chatting about the papers,
however, when at the door, a few minutes later, appeared her father, in
his arms a big Bible, and a sizable pasteboard box."Right here, father, please," she said then, to Mr.The old man frowned and cast disapproving eyes on his daughter and the
table.I don't want them there," he observed coldly.With the words he turned back into the house.Smith's bewildered eyes searched Miss Maggie's face and
once again they found nothing but serene unconcern."This way, please," she directed cheerily.And, still marveling, he
followed her into the house.Smith thought he had never seen so charming a living-room.A
comfortable chair invited him, and he sat down.He felt suddenly rested
and at home, and at peace with the world.Realizing that, in some way,
the room had produced this effect, he looked curiously about him,
trying to solve the secret of it.Reluctantly to himself he confessed that it was a very ordinary room.The carpet was poor, and was badly worn.The chairs, while comfortable
looking, were manifestly not expensive, and had seen long service.Simple curtains were at the windows, and a few fair prints were on the
walls.Two or three vases, of good lines but cheap materials, held
flowers, and there was a plain but roomy set of shelves filled with
books--not immaculate, leather-backed, gilt-lettered "sets" but rows of
dingy, worn volumes, whose very shabbiness was at once an invitation
and a promise.Smith see protecting cover
mat, or tidy.He decided then that this must be why he felt suddenly so
rested and at peace with all mankind.Even as the conviction came to
him, however he was suddenly aware that everything was not, after all,
peaceful or harmonious.Duff and his daughter were arranging the Bible and the
papers.Miss Maggie suggested piles in a certain order: her father
promptly objected, and arranged them otherwise.Miss Maggie placed the
papers first for perusal: her father said "Absurd!"Miss Maggie started to draw up a chair to the table: her father
derisively asked her if she expected a man to sit in that--and drew up
a different one.Smith, when he was finally invited to take a
seat at the table, found everything quite the most convenient and
comfortable possible.Once more into Miss Maggie's face he sent a sharply inquiring glance,
and once more he encountered nothing but unruffled cheerfulness.With a really genuine interest in the records before him, Mr.The Bible had been in the Blaisdell family for
generations, and it was full of valuable names and dates.Duff, on the other side of the table, was arranging into piles the
papers before him.He complained of the draft, and Miss Maggie shut the
window.He said then that he didn't mean he wanted to suffocate, and
she opened the one on the other side.The clock had hardly struck three
when he accused her of having forgotten his medicine.Yet when she
brought it he refused to take it.She had not brought the right kind of
spoon, he said, and she knew perfectly well he never took it out of
that narrow-bowl kind.He complained of the light, and she lowered the
curtain; but he told her that he didn't mean he didn't want to see at
all, so she put it up halfway.He said his coat was too warm, and she
brought another one.He put it on grudgingly, but he declared that it
was as much too thin as the other was too thick.Smith, in spite of his efforts to be politely deaf and blind, found
himself unable to confine his attention to birth, death, and marriage
notices.Once he almost uttered an explosive "Good Heavens, how do you
stand it?"But he stopped himself just in time, and
fiercely wrote with a very black mark that Submit Blaisdell was born in
eighteen hundred and one.Duff's attention was frowningly turned across the table toward himself."If you will spend your time over such silly stuff, why don't you use a
bigger book?""Because it wouldn't fit my pocket," smiled Mr."Just what business of yours is it, anyhow, when these people lived and
died?""Why don't you let them alone, then?"Why, I--I--" Mr."Well, I can tell you it's a silly business, whatever you find.If you
find your grandfather's a bigger man than you are, you'll be proud of
it, but you ought to be ashamed of it--'cause you aren't bigger
yourself!On the other hand, if you find he ISN'T as big as you are,
you'll be ashamed of that, when you ought to be proud of it--'cause
you've gone him one better.But can't you do any work, real work?""He is doing work, real work, now, father," interposed Miss Maggie
quickly."He's having a woeful time, too.If you'd only help him, now,
and show him those papers.""Well, I shan't," he observed tartly."I'M not a fool, if he is.I'm
going out to the porch where I can get some air.""There, work as long as you like, Mr.I knew you'd rather work
by yourself," nodded Miss Maggie, moving the piles of papers nearer him."But, good Heavens, how do you stand--" exploded Mr.Smith before he
realized that this time he had really said the words aloud."After all, it
doesn't matter.You couldn't help
seeing--how things were, of course, and I forgot, for a moment, that
you were a stranger.You see,
father is nervous, and not at all well."But do you mean that you always have to tell him to do what you don't
want, in order to--well--that is--" Mr.Smith, finding himself in very
deep water, blushed again painfully.Miss Maggie met his dismayed gaze with cheerful candor."Tell him to do what I DON'T want in order to get him to do what I do
want him to?But I don't mind; really I don't.And when you know how, what does it matter?To most of the world we say, 'Please do,' when we
want a thing, while to him we have to say, 'Please don't.'You see, it's really very simple--when you know how."He wanted to say more; but
Miss Maggie, with a smiling nod, turned away, so he went back to his
work.Benny, wandering in from the kitchen, with both hands full of cookies,
plumped himself down on the cushioned window-seat, and drew a sigh of
content.The blithe voice and pleasant smile took all the sting
from the prompt refusal.Maybe pa would--a little; but Bess and ma wouldn't.Miss Maggie crossed to a little stand and picked up
a small box.Benny shifted his now depleted stock of cookies to one hand, dropped to
his knees on the floor, and dumped the contents of the box upon the
seat before him."They won't let me eat cookies any more at home--in the house, I mean."But you know you have to pick up your crumbs here, dear."But I don't mind--after I've had the fun of eatin' first.But
they won't let me drop 'em ter begin with, there, nor take any of the
boys inter the house.Honest, Aunt Maggie, there ain't anything a
feller can do,'seems so, if ye live on the West Side," he persisted
soberly.Smith, copying dates at the table, was conscious of a slightly
apprehensive glance in his direction from Miss Maggie's eyes, as she
murmured:--

"But you're forgetting your puzzle, Benny."I can't do puzzles there, either.""All the more reason, then, why you should like to do them here.See,
where does this dog's head go?"Listlessly Benny took the bit of pictured wood in his fingers and began
to fit it into the pattern before him."I used ter do 'em an' leave 'em 'round, but ma says I can't now.Callers might come and find 'em, an' what would they say--on the West
Side!An' that's the way 'tis with everything.Ma an' Bess are always
doin' things, or not doin' 'em, for those callers."Yes, yes, dear, but they will, when they get acquainted.You haven't
found where the dog's head goes yet.""Pa says he don't want ter get acquainted.He'd rather have the old
friends, what don't mind baked beans, an' shirt-sleeves, an' doin' yer
own work, an' what thinks more of yer heart than they do of yer
pocketbook.An' say, we have ter wash our
hands every meal now--on the table, I mean--in those little glass
wash-dishes.Ma went down an' bought some, an' she's usin' 'em every
day, so's ter get used to 'em.She says everybody that is anybody has
'em nowadays.Bess thinks they're great, but I don't.I don't like 'em
a mite."It doesn't matter--it doesn't really matter,
does it, if you do have to use the little dishes?Come, you're not half
doing the puzzle."Benny shifted his position, and picked up a three-cornered
bit of wood carrying the picture of a dog's paw.You see, things are so different--on the West Side.Miss Maggie turned from the puzzle with a start.It's keepin' books for a man.It brings in
quite a lot extry, ma says; but she wouldn't let me have some new
roller skates when mine broke.She's savin' up for a chafin' dish.You eat out of it, some way--I
mean, it cooks things ter eat; an' Bess wants one.ALL our eatin's different,'seems so, on the West Side.Ma has
dinners nights now, instead of noons.She says the Pennocks do, an'
everybody does who is anybody.Pa don't, either,
an' half the time he can't get home in time for it, anyhow, on account
of gettin' back to his new job, ye know, an'--"

"Oh, I've found where the dog's head goes," cried Miss Maggie, There
was a hint of desperation in her voice."I shall have your puzzle all
done for you myself, if you don't look out, Benny.I don't believe you
can do it, anyhow."retorted Benny, with sudden
spirit, falling to work in earnest."I never saw a puzzle yet I
couldn't do!"Smith, bending assiduously over his work at the table, heard Miss
Maggie's sigh of relief--and echoed it, from sympathy.CHAPTER VII

POOR MAGGIE AND SOME OTHERS


It was half an hour later, when Mr.Smith and Benny were walking across
the common together, that Benny asked an abrupt question."Is Aunt Maggie goin' ter be put in your book, Mr."Why--er--yes; her name will be entered as the daughter of the man who
married the Widow Blaisdell, probably.Aunt Maggie don't have
nothin' much, yer know, except her father an' housework--housework
either for him or some of us.An' I guess she's had quite a lot of
things ter bother her, an' make her feel bad, so I hoped she'd be in
the book.Though if she wasn't, she'd just laugh an' say it doesn't
matter, of course."Yes, when things plague, an' somethin' don't go right.She says it
helps a lot ter just remember that it doesn't matter."Well, no,--I don't think I do see," frowned Mr."Oh, yes," plunged in Benny; "'cause, you see, if yer stop ter think
about it--this thing that's plaguin' ye--you'll see how really small
an' no-account it is, an' how, when you put it beside really big things
it doesn't matter at all--it doesn't REALLY matter, ye know.Aunt
Maggie says she's done it years an' years, ever since she was just a
girl, an' somethin' bothered her; an' it's helped a lot.""But there are lots of things that DO matter," persisted Mr.Benny swelled a bit importantly, "I know what you mean.Aunt
Maggie says that, too; an' she says we must be very careful an' not get
it wrong.It's only the little things that bother us, an' that we wish
were different, that we must say 'It doesn't matter' about.It DOES
matter whether we're good an' kind an' tell the truth an' shame the
devil; but it DOESN'T matter whether we have ter live on the West Side
an' eat dinner nights instead of noons, an' not eat cookies any of the
time in the house,--see?""Good for you, Benny,--and good for Aunt Maggie!"Oh, you don't know Aunt Maggie, yet.She's always tryin'
ter make people think things don't matter.A moment later he had turned down his own street, and Mr.Very often, in the days that followed, Mr.Smith thought of this speech
of Benny's.He had opportunity to verify it, for he was seeing a good
deal of Miss Maggie, and it seemed, indeed, to him that half the town
was coming to her to learn that something "didn't matter"--though very
seldom, except to Benny, did he hear her say the words themselves.It
was merely that to her would come men, women, and children, each with a
sorry tale of discontent or disappointment.And it was always as if
they left with her their burden, for when they turned away, head and
shoulders were erect once more, eyes were bright, and the step was
alert and eager.For that matter, he wondered how she
did--a great many things.Smith was, indeed, seeing a good deal of Miss Maggie these days.He
told himself that it was the records that attracted him.Sometimes he just sat in one of the comfortable
chairs and watched Miss Maggie, content if she gave him a word now and
then.He liked the way she carried her head, and the way her hair waved away
from her shapely forehead.He liked the quiet strength of the way her
capable hands lay motionless in her lap when their services were not
required.He liked to watch for the twinkle in her eye, and for the
dimple in her cheek that told a smile was coming.He liked to hear her
talk to Benny.He even liked to hear her talk to her father--when he
could control his temper sufficiently.Best of all he liked his own
comfortable feeling of being quite at home, and at peace with all the
world--the feeling that always came to him now whenever he entered the
house, in spite of the fact that the welcome accorded him by Mr.Duff
was hardly more friendly than at the first.Smith it was a matter of small moment whether Mr.Duff welcomed
him cordially or not.He even indulged now and then in a bout of his
own with the gentleman, chuckling inordinately when results showed that
he had pitched his remark at just the right note of contrariety to get
what he wanted.Smith, at least nominally, spent his
time at his legitimate task of studying and copying the Blaisdell
family records, of which he was finding a great number.Rufus Blaisdell
apparently had done no little "digging" himself in his own day, and Mr.Smith told Miss Maggie that it was all a great "find" for him.She said that she was glad if she could be
of any help to him, and she told him to come whenever he liked.She
arranged the Bible and the big box of papers on a little table in the
corner, and told him to make himself quite at home; and she showed so
plainly that she regarded him as quite one of the family, that Mr.Smith might be pardoned for soon considering himself so.It was while at work in this corner that he came to learn so much of
Miss Maggie's daily life, and of her visitors.Although many of these visitors were strangers to him, some of them he
knew.Hattie Blaisdell, with a countenance even more
florid than usual.She was breathless and excited, and her eyes were
worried.She was going to give a luncheon, she said.She wanted Miss
Maggie's silver spoons, and her forks, and her hand painted
sugar-and-creamer, and Mother Blaisdell's cut-glass dish.Smith, supposing that Miss Maggie herself was to be at the
luncheon, was just rejoicing within him that she was to have this
pleasant little outing, when he heard Mrs.Blaisdell telling her to be
sure to come at eleven to be in the kitchen, and asking where could she
get a maid to serve in the dining-room, and what should she do with
Benny.He'd have to be put somewhere, or else he'd be sure to upset
everything.Smith did not hear Miss Maggie's answer to all this, for she
hurried her visitor to the kitchen at once to look up the spoons, she
said.But indirectly he obtained a very conclusive reply; for he found
Miss Maggie gone one day when he came; and Benny, who was in her place,
told him all about it, even to the dandy frosted cake Aunt Maggie had
made for the company to eat.Jane had a tired
frown between her brows and a despairing droop to her lips.She carried
a large bundle which she dropped unceremoniously into Miss Maggie's lap."There, I'm dead beat out, and I've brought it to you.You've just got
to help me," she finished, sinking into a chair."Why, of course, if I can.Miss Maggie's deft fingers
were already untying the knot.But I thought the last time it couldn't ever be done again.""Yes, I know; but there's lots of good in it yet," interposed Mrs.Jane
decidedly; "and I've bought new velvet and new lace, and some buttons
and a new lining.I THOUGHT I could do it alone, but I've reached a
point where I just have got to have help."Yes, of course, but"--Miss Maggie was lifting a half-finished sleeve
doubtfully--"why didn't you go to Flora?She'd know exactly--"

Mrs."Because I can't afford to go to Flora," she interrupted coldly."I
have to pay Flora, and you know it.If I had the money I should be glad
to do it, of course.But I haven't, and charity begins at home I think.Besides, I do go to her for NEW dresses.Of
course, if you don't WANT to help me--"

"Oh, but I do," plunged in Miss Maggie hurriedly."Come out into the
kitchen where we'll have more room," she exclaimed, gathering the
bundle into her arms and springing to her feet."I've got some other lace at home--yards and yards.I got a lot, it was
so cheap," recounted Mrs."But I'm afraid
it won't do for this, and I don't know as it will do for anything, it's
so--"

The kitchen door slammed sharply, and Mr.Half an
hour later, however, he saw Mrs.The frown was
gone from her face and the droop from the corners of her mouth.Miss Flora's thin little face looked
more pinched than ever, and her eyes more anxious, Mr.Smith's greeting, was so wan he
wished she had not tried to give it.She sat down then, by the window, and began to chat with Miss Maggie;
and very soon Mr.Smith heard her say this:--

"No, Maggie, I don't know, really, what I am going to do--truly I
don't.Why, I don't earn enough to pay my
rent, hardly, now, ter say nothin' of my feed.""But I thought that Hattie--ISN'T Hattie having some new dresses--and
Bessie, too?""Yes, oh, yes; they are having three or four.But they don't come to ME
any more.They've gone to that French woman that makes the Pennocks'
things, you know, with the queer name.And of course it's all right,
and you can't blame 'em, livin' on the West Side, as they do now.And,
of course, I ain't so up ter date as she is.(Miss Maggie laughed merrily, but Mr.Smith, copying dates at the table, detected a note in the laugh that
was not merriment.)"You're up to date enough for me.I've got just the
job for you, too."Why, Maggie, you haven't, either!"(In spite of the
incredulity of voice and manner, Miss Flora sprang joyfully to her
feet.)"You never had me make you a--" Again the kitchen door slammed
shut, and Mr.Smith was left to finish the sentence for himself.Neither was his face
expressing just then the sympathy which might be supposed to be
showing, after so sorry a tale as Miss Flora had been telling.Smith, with an actual elation of countenance, was
scribbling on the edge of his notebook words that certainly he had
never found in the Blaisdell records before him: "Two months more,
then--a hundred thousand dollars.Half an hour later, as on the previous day, Mr.Smith saw a
metamorphosed woman hurrying down the little path to the street.But
the woman to-day was carrying a bundle--and it was the same bundle that
the woman the day before had brought.Smith soon learned, were Miss Maggie's visitors
women.Besides Benny, with his grievances, young Fred Blaisdell came
sometimes, and poured into Miss Maggie's sympathetic ears the story of
Gussie Pennock's really remarkable personality, or of what he was going
to do when he went to college--and afterwards.Jim Blaisdell drifted in quite frequently Sunday afternoons, though
apparently all he came for was to smoke and read in one of the big
comfortable chairs.Smith himself had fallen into the way of
strolling down to Miss Maggie's almost every Sunday after dinner.Frank Blaisdell rattled up to the door in
his grocery wagon.His face was very red, and his mutton-chop whiskers
were standing straight out at each side.Jane had collapsed, he said, utterly collapsed.All the week she had
been house-cleaning and doing up curtains; and now this morning,
expressly against his wishes, to save hiring a man, she had put down
the parlor carpet herself.Now she was flat on her back, and supper to
be got for the boarder, and the Saturday baking yet to be done.And
could Maggie come and help them out?Smith hurried out from his corner
and insisted that "the boarder" did not want any supper anyway--and
could they not live on crackers and milk for the coming few days?But Miss Maggie laughed and said, "Nonsense!"And in an incredibly
short time she was ready to drive back in the grocery wagon.Later,
when he went home, Mr.Smith found her there, presiding over one of the
best suppers he had eaten since his arrival in Hillerton.She came
every day after that, for a week, for Mrs.Jane remained "flat on her
back" seven days, with a doctor in daily attendance, supplemented by a
trained nurse peremptorily ordered by that same doctor from the nearest
city.Miss Maggie, with the assistance of Mellicent, attended to the
housework.But in spite of the excellence of the cuisine, meal time was
a most unhappy period to everybody concerned, owing to the sarcastic
comments of Mr.Frank Blaisdell as to how much his wife had "saved" by
not having a man to put down that carpet.Mellicent had little time now to go walking or auto-riding with Carl
Pennock.Her daily life was, indeed, more pleasure-starved than
ever--all of which was not lost on Mr.Smith and Mellicent
were fast friends now.Given a man with a sympathetic understanding on
one side, and a girl hungry for that same sympathy and understanding,
and it could hardly be otherwise.Smith
knew now just how hungry a young girl can be for fun and furbelows."Of course I've got my board and clothes, and I ought to be thankful
for them," she stormed hotly to him one day.But sometimes it seems as if I'd actually be willing to go hungry
for meat and potato, if for once--just once--I could buy a five-pound
box of candy, and eat it up all at once, if I wanted to!But now, why
now I can't even treat a friend to an ice-cream soda without seeing
mother's shocked, reproachful eyes over the rim of the glass!"It was not easy then (nor many times subsequently) for Mr.Smith to
keep from asking Mellicent the utterly absurd question of how many
five-pound boxes of candy she supposed one hundred thousand dollars
would buy.But he did keep from it--by heroic self-sacrifice and the
comforting recollection that she would know some day, if she cared to
take the trouble to reckon it up.In Mellicent's love affair with young Pennock Mr.Not that he regarded it as really serious, but because it
appeared to bring into Mellicent's life something of the youth and
gayety to which he thought she was entitled.He was almost as concerned
as was Miss Maggie, therefore, when one afternoon, soon after Mrs.Jane
Blaisdell's complete recovery from her "carpet tax" (as Frank Blaisdell
termed his wife's recent illness), Mellicent rushed into the Duff
living-room with rose-red cheeks and blazing eyes, and an
explosive:--"Aunt Maggie, Aunt Maggie, can't you get mother to let me
go away somewhere--anywhere, right off?"[Illustration caption: "I CAN'T HELP IT, AUNT MAGGIE.I'VE JUST GOT TO
BE AWAY!"]And just to-morrow the Pennocks' dance?""But that's it--that's why I want to go," flashed Mellicent."I don't
want to be at the dance--and I don't want to be in town, and NOT at the
dance."Smith, at his table in the corner, glanced nervously toward the
door, then bent assiduously over his work, as being less conspicuous
than the flight he had been tempted for a moment to essay.But even
this was not to be, for the next moment, to his surprise, the girl
appealed directly to him.Smith, please, won't YOU take me somewhere to-morrow?"Even Miss Maggie was shocked now, and showed it."I can't help it, Aunt Maggie."But, my dear, to ASK a gentleman--" reproved Miss Maggie.She came to
an indeterminate pause.Smith had crossed the room and dropped into
a chair near them."See here, little girl, suppose you tell us just what is behind--all
this," he began gently.Please let it go that I want to be away."Mellicent, we can't do that.""We can't do--anything, until you tell us what it is."Mellicent's eyes, still mutinous, sought first
the kindly questioning face of the man, then the no less kindly but
rather grave face of the woman.Then in a little breathless burst it
came."It's just something they're all saying Mrs.Two little red spots had come into Miss Maggie's cheeks."It was just that--that they weren't going to let Carl Pennock go with
me any more--anywhere, or come to see me, because I--I didn't belong to
their set."Miss Maggie said nothing, but the red spots deepened.It's just--that we aren't rich like them."That you haven't got--got--Oh, ye gods!"Almost
instantly, however, he sobered: he had caught the expression of the two
faces opposite."I beg your pardon," he apologized promptly."It was only that to
me--there was something very funny about that.""But, Mellicent, are you sure?I don't believe she ever said it,"
doubted Miss Maggie."He hasn't been near me--for a week."I don't care a bit--not a bit--about THAT!"What does
it matter if she did say it, dear?"But I can't bear to have them all talk--and notice," choked Mellicent."And we were together such a lot before; and now--I tell you I CAN'T go
to that dance to-morrow night!""And you shan't, if you don't want to," Mr."Right
here and now I invite you and your Aunt Maggie to drive with me
to-morrow to Hubbardville.There are some records there that I want to
look up.It will take all day, and we
shan't be home till late in the evening.I'll go straight now
and telephone to somebody--everybody--that I shan't be there; that I'm
going to be OUT OF TOWN!"She sprang joyously to her feet--but Miss
Maggie held out a restraining hand.You don't care--you SAID you didn't care--that
Carl Pennock doesn't come to see you any more?""Then you wouldn't want others to think you did, would you?""You have said that you'd go to this party, haven't you?That is, you
accepted the invitation, didn't you, and people know that you did,
don't they?"But--just what do you think these people are going to say
to-morrow night, when you aren't there?""Why, that I--I--" The color drained from her face and left it white."They wouldn't EXPECT me to go after that--insult.""Then they'll understand that you--CARE, won't they?""Why, I--I--They--I CAN'T--" She turned sharply and walked to the
window.For a long minute she stood, her back toward the two watching
her.Then, with equal abruptness, she turned and came back.Her cheeks
were very pink now, her eyes very bright.She carried her head with a
proud little lift.Smith, that I won't go with you to-morrow, after all,"
she said steadily."I've decided to go--to that dance."The next moment the door shut crisply behind her.CHAPTER VIII

A SANTA CLAUS HELD UP


It was about five months after the multi-millionaire, Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton, had started for South America, that Edward D. Norton, Esq.,
received the following letter:--

DEAR NED:--I'm glad there's only one more month to wait.I feel like
Santa Claus with a box of toys, held up by a snowdrift, and I just
can't wait to see the children dance--when they get them.And let me say right here and now how glad I am that I did this thing.Oh, yes, I'll admit I still feel like the small boy at the keyhole, at
times, perhaps; but I'll forget that--when the children begin to dance.And, really, never have I seen a bunch of people whom I thought a
little money would do more good to than the Blaisdells here in
Hillerton.My only regret is that I didn't know about Miss Maggie Duff,
so that she could have had some, too.(Oh, yes, I've found out all
about "Poor Maggie" now, and she's a dear--the typical
self-sacrificing, self-effacing bearer of everybody's burdens,
including a huge share of her own!)However, she isn't a Blaisdell, of
course, so I couldn't have worked her into my scheme very well, I
suppose, even if I had known about her.They are all fond of
her--though they impose on her time and her sympathies abominably.But
I reckon she'll get some of the benefits of the others' thousands.Jane, in particular, is always wishing she could do something for "Poor
Maggie," so I dare say she'll be looked out for all right.As to who will prove to be the wisest handler of the hundred thousand,
and thus my eventual heir, I haven't the least idea.As I said before,
they all need money, and need it badly--need it to be comfortable and
happy, I mean.They aren't really poor, any of them, except, perhaps,
Miss Flora.She is a little hard up, poor soul.I
wonder what she'll get first, Niagara, the phonograph, or something to
eat without looking at the price.Did I ever write you about those
"three wishes" of hers?I can't see that any of the family are really extravagant unless,
perhaps, it's Mrs.She IS ambitious, and is inclined
to live on a scale a little beyond her means, I judge.But that will be
all right, of course, when she has the money to gratify her tastes.Jim--poor fellow, I shall be glad to see him take it easy, for once.He
reminds me of the old horse I saw the other day running one of those
infernal treadmill threshing machines--always going, but never getting
there.He works, and works hard, and then he gets a job nights and
works harder; but he never quite catches up with his bills, I fancy.What a world of solid comfort he'll take with that hundred thousand!I
can hear him draw the long breath now--for once every bill paid!Of course, the Frank Blaisdells are the most thrifty of the bunch--at
least, Mrs.Frank, "Jane," is--and I dare say they would be the most
conservative handlers of my millions.Anyhow, I
shall be glad to see them enjoy themselves meanwhile with the hundred
thousand.Jane will be constrained to clear my room of a few
of the mats and covers and tidies!At least, I shall
surely have a vacation from her everlasting "We can't afford it," and
her equally everlasting "Of course, if I had the money I'd do it."Praise be for that!--and it'll be worth a hundred thousand to me,
believe me, Ned.As for her husband--I'm not sure how he will take it.It isn't corn or
peas or flour or sugar, you see, and I'm not posted as to his opinion
of much of anything else.He'll spend some of it, though,--I'm sure of
that.I don't think he always thoroughly appreciates his wife's thrifty
ideas of economy.I haven't forgotten the night I came home to find
Mrs.Frank rampaging around the house with
every gas jet at full blast.It seems he was packing his bag to go on a
hurried business trip.He laughed a little sheepishly--I suppose he saw
my blinking amazement at the illumination--and said something about
being tired of always feeling his way through pitch-dark rooms.So, as
I say, I'm not quite sure of Mr.Frank when he comes into possession of
the hundred thousand.He's been cooped up in the dark so long he may
want to blow in the whole hundred thousand in one grand blare of light.However, I reckon I needn't worry--he'll still have Mrs.Jane--to turn
some of the gas jets down!As for the younger generation--they're fine, every one of them; and
just think what this money will mean to them in education and
advantages!Jim's son, Fred, eighteen, is a fine, manly boy.He's got
his mother's ambitions, and he's keen for college--even talks of
working his way (much to his mother's horror) if his father can't find
the money to send him.Of course, that part will be all right now--in a
month.The daughter, Bessie (almost seventeen), is an exceedingly pretty girl.She, too, is ambitious--almost too much so, perhaps, for her happiness,
in the present state of their pocketbook.But of course that, too, will
be all right, after next month.Benny, the nine-year-old, will be
concerned as little as any one over that hundred thousand dollars, I
imagine.The real value of the gift he will not appreciate, of course;
in fact, I doubt if he even approves of it--lest his privileges as to
meals and manners be still further curtailed.Now,
Mellicent--

Perhaps in no one do I expect to so thoroughly rejoice as I do in poor
little pleasure-starved Mellicent.I realize, of course, that it will
mean to her the solid advantages of college, music-culture, and travel;
but I must confess that in my dearest vision, the child is reveling in
one grand whirl of pink dresses and chocolate bonbons.I GAVE her one five-pound box of candy, but I never repeated the
mistake.Besides enduring the manifestly suspicious disapproval of her
mother because I had made the gift, I have had the added torment of
seeing that box of chocolates doled out to that poor child at the rate
of two pieces a day.They aren't gone yet, but I'll warrant they're as
hard as bullets--those wretched bonbons.But there is yet another phase of the money business in connection with
Mellicent that pleases me mightily.A certain youth by the name of Carl
Pennock has been beauing her around a good deal, since I came.The
Pennocks have some money--fifty thousand, or so, I believe--and it is
reported that Mrs.Pennock has put her foot down on the budding
romance--because the Blaisdells HAVE NOT GOT MONEY ENOUGH!(Begin to
see where my chuckles come in?)However true this report may be, the
fact remains that the youth has not been near the house for a month
past, nor taken Mellicent anywhere.Of course, it shows him and his
family up--for just what they are; but it has been mortifying for poor
Mellicent.She's showing her pluck like a little trump, however, and
goes serenely on her way with her head just enough in the air--but not
too much.I don't think Mellicent's real heart is affected in the least--she's
only eighteen, remember--but her pride IS.Jane
is thoroughly angry as well as mortified.She says Mellicent is every
whit as good as those Pennocks, and that the woman who would let a
paltry thing like money stand in the way of her son's affections is a
pretty small specimen.For her part, she never did have any use for
rich folks, anyway, and she is proud and glad that she's poor!However, so much
for her--and she may change her opinion one of these days.My private suspicion is that young Pennock is already repentant, and is
pulling hard at his mother's leading-strings; for I was with Mellicent
the other day when we met the lad face to face on the street.Mellicent
smiled and nodded casually, but Pennock--he turned all colors of the
rainbow with terror, pleading, apology, and assumed indifference all
racing each other across his face.Dear, dear, but he was a sight!There is, too, another feature in the case.It seems that a new family
by the name of Gaylord have come to town and opened up the old Gaylord
mansion.Gaylord is a son of old Peter Gaylord, and is a millionaire.They are making quite a splurge in the way of balls and liveried
servants, and motor cars, and the town is agog with it all.There are
young people in the family, and especially there is a girl, Miss Pearl,
whom, report says, the Pennocks have selected as being a suitable mate
for Carl.At all events the Pennocks and the Gaylords have struck up a
furious friendship, and the young people of both families are in the
forefront of innumerable social affairs--in most of which Mellicent is
left out.So now you have it--the whole story.And next month comes to
Mellicent's father one hundred thousand dollars.Do you wonder I say
the plot thickens?(The man who
says health biscuit to me now gets knocked down--and I've got the
strength to do it, too!)I've gained
twenty pounds, and I'm having the time of my life.I'm even enjoying
being a genealogist--a little.I've about exhausted the resources of
Hillerton, and have begun to make trips to the neighboring towns.I can
even spend an afternoon in an old cemetery copying dates from
moss-grown gravestones, and not entirely lose my appetite for dinner--I
mean, supper.I was even congratulating myself that I was really quite
a genealogist when, the other day, I met the REAL THING.Heavens, Ned,
that man had fourteen thousand four hundred and seventy-two dates at
his tongue's end, and he said them all over to me.He knows the name of
every Blake (he was a Blake) back to the year one, how many children
they had (and they had some families then, let me tell you!), and when
they all died, and why.I was
hunting for a certain stone and I asked him a question.It was
like setting a match to one of those Fourth-of-July flower-pot
sky-rocket affairs.That question was the match that set him going, and
thereafter he was a gushing geyser of names and dates.He began at the Blaisdells, but skipped almost at once to the
Blakes--there were a lot of them near us.In five minutes he had me
dumb from sheer stupefaction.In ten minutes he had made a century run,
and by noon he had got to the Crusades.We went through the Dark Ages
very appropriately, waiting in an open tomb for a thunderstorm to pass.We had got to the year one when I had to leave to drive back to
Hillerton.I've invited him to come to see Father Duff.I thought I'd
like to have them meet.He knows a lot about the Duffs--a Blake married
one, 'way back somewhere.I'd like to hear him and Father Duff
talk--or, rather, I'd like to hear him TRY to talk to Father Duff.Did
I ever write you Father Duff's opinion of genealogists?I'm not seeing so much of Father Duff these days.Now that it's grown a
little cooler he spends most of his time in his favorite chair before
the cook stove in the kitchen.It should be shipped by freight and read
in sections.But I wanted you to know how things are here.You can
appreciate it the more--when you come.You're not forgetting, of course, that it's on the first day of
November that Mr.Stanley G. Fulton's envelope of instructions is to be
opened.As ever yours,

JOHN SMITH.CHAPTER IX

"DEAR COUSIN STANLEY"


It was very early in November that Mr.Smith, coming home one
afternoon, became instantly aware that something very extraordinary had
happened.Frank Blaisdell, his wife, Jane,
and their daughter, Mellicent.Mellicent's cheeks were pink, and her
eyes more star-like than ever.Her
eyes were excited, but incredulous.Frank was still in his white
work-coat, which he wore behind the counter, but which he never wore
upstairs in his home.It was an ecstatic cry from Mellicent that came first to Mr.Smith, you can't guess what's happened!You
couldn't guess in a million years!"Smith was looking almost as happily
excited as Mellicent herself.Mellicent clasped her hands before her.Smith,
we are going to have a hundred thousand--"

"Mellicent, I wouldn't talk of it--yet," interfered her mother sharply."But, mother, it's no secret."Of course not--if it's true.But it isn't true," retorted the woman,
with excited emphasis."No man in his senses would do such a thing."Smith, looking suddenly a little less
happy."Leave a hundred thousand dollars apiece to three distant relations he
never saw.""But he was our cousin--you said he was our cousin," interposed
Mellicent, "and when he died--"

"The letter did not say he had died," corrected her mother."He just
hasn't been heard from.But he will be heard from--and then where will
our hundred thousand dollars be?""But the lawyer's coming to give it to us," maintained Mr."Here, read this,
please, and tell us if we have lost our senses--or if somebody else
has."A close observer might have noticed that his
hand shook a little.The letterhead carried the name of a Chicago law
firm, but Mr.He plunged at once into the
text of the letter.I want to hear it again," pleaded Mellicent.Smith then, after clearing his throat),--I
understand that you are a distant kinsman of Mr.Stanley G. Fulton, the
Chicago millionaire.Fulton left this city on what was reported to
be a somewhat extended exploring tour of South America.Before his
departure he transferred to me, as trustee, certain securities worth
about $300,000.He left with me a sealed envelope, entitled "Terms of
Trust," and instructed me to open such envelope in six months from the
date written thereon--if he had not returned--and thereupon to dispose
of the securities according to the terms of the trust.I will add that
he also left with me a second sealed envelope entitled "Last Will and
Testament," but instructed me not to open such envelope until two years
from the date written thereon.I have opened the envelope
entitled "Terms of Trust," and find that I am directed to convert the
securities into cash with all convenient speed, and forthwith to pay
over one third of the net proceeds to his kinsman, Frank G. Blaisdell;
one third to his kinsman, James A. Blaisdell; and one third to his
kinswoman, Flora B. Blaisdell, all of Hillerton.I shall, of course, discharge my duty as trustee under this instrument
with all possible promptness.Some of the securities have already been
converted into cash, and within a few days I shall come to Hillerton to
pay over the cash in the form of certified checks; and I shall ask you
at that time to be so good as to sign a receipt for your share.Meanwhile this letter is to apprise you of your good fortune and to
offer you my congratulations.Very truly yours,

EDWARD D. NORTON."Well, what do you think of it?"Frank Blaisdell, his arms
akimbo."Why, it's fine, of course."Then it's all straight, you think?""Je-hos-a-phat!""But he'll come back--you see if he don't!"You'll still have your hundred thousand," smiled Mr.I doubt if he could, if he wanted to.""And we're really going to have a whole hundred thousand dollars?""I reckon you are--less the inheritance tax, perhaps."Do you mean we've
got to PAY because we've got that money?""Why, y-yes, I suppose so.Isn't there an inheritance tax in this
State?"Jane's lips were at their most economical
pucker."Do we have to pay a GREAT deal?Isn't there any way to save
doing that?""No, there isn't," cut in her husband crisply."And I guess we can pay
the inheritance tax--with a hundred thousand to pay it out of.We're
going to SPEND some of this money, Jane."The telephone bell in the hall jangled its peremptory summons, and Mr.In a minute he returned, a new excitement on his
face.And they've got it, too, haven't they?""And Aunt Flora, and--" She stopped suddenly, a growing dismay in her
eyes."Why, he didn't--he didn't leave a cent to AUNT MAGGIE!"There was genuine concern
in Frank Blaisdell's voice."But we can give her some of ours, mother,--we can give her some of
ours," urged the girl."It isn't ours to give--yet," remarked her mother, a bit coldly."But, mother, you WILL do it," importuned Mellicent."You've always
said you would, if you had it to give.""And I say it again, Mellicent.I shall never see her suffer, you may
be sure,--if I have the money to relieve her.But--" She stopped
abruptly at the sound of an excited voice down the hall.Miss Flora,
evidently coming in through the kitchen, was hurrying toward them."Jane--Mellicent--where are you?she
panted, as she reached the room and sank into a chair."Did you ever
hear anything like it in all your life?You had one, too, didn't you?"she cried, her eyes falling on the letter in her brother's hand."But
'tain't true, of course!"Miss Flora wore no head-covering.She wore one glove (wrong side out),
and was carrying the other one.Her dress, evidently donned hastily for
the street, was unevenly fastened, showing the topmost button without a
buttonhole.Smith says it's true," triumphed Mellicent.So almost accusing was the look in her eyes that Mr."Why--er--ah--the letter speaks for itself Miss Flora," he stammered."But it CAN'T be true," reiterated Miss Flora."The idea of a man I
never saw giving me a hundred thousand dollars like that!--and Frank
and Jim, too!""But he's your cousin--you said he was your cousin," Mr."And you have his picture in your album.I didn't know HE knew I was his cousin.I
don't s'pose he's got MY picture in HIS album!It's some other Flora Blaisdell, I tell you.""There, I never thought of that," cried Jane."It probably is some
other Blaisdells.Well, anyhow, if it is, we won't have to pay that
inheritance tax.At this moment the rattling of the front-door knob and an imperative
knocking brought Mrs."There's Hattie, now, and that door's locked," she cried, hurrying into
the hall.When she returned a moment later Harriet Blaisdell and Bessie were with
her.Harriet Blaisdell a new, indescribable air of
commanding importance.Smith she appeared to have grown inches
taller."Well, I do hope, Jane, NOW you'll live in a decent place," she was
saying, as they entered the room, "and not oblige your friends to climb
up over a grocery store.""Well, I guess you can stand the grocery store a few more days, Hattie,"
observed Frank Blaisdell dryly."How long do you s'pose we'd live--any
of us--if 'twa'n't for the grocery stores to feed us?I told him I was coming here, and to come right over
himself at once; that the very first thing we must have was a family
conclave, just ourselves, you know, so as to plan what to give out to
the public."Smith was on his feet, looking somewhat embarrassed;
"perhaps, then, you would rather I were not present at the--er--family
conclave.""Why, you ARE one of the family,'seems so," cried Mellicent."Besides, you are interested in what concerns us, I know--for the book;
so, of course, you'll be interested in this legacy of dear Cousin
Stanley's."Smith collapsed suddenly behind his handkerchief, with one of the
choking coughs to which he appeared to be somewhat addicted."Ain't you getting a little familiar with 'dear Cousin Stanley,'
Hattie?""But, Hattie, we were just sayin', 'fore you came, that it couldn't be
true; that it must mean some other Blaisdells somewhere.""There couldn't be any other Frank and Jim
and Flora Blaisdell, in a Hillerton, too.Besides, Jim said over the
telephone that that was one of the best law firms in Chicago.Don't you
suppose they know what they're talking about?I'm sure, I think it's
quite the expected thing that he should leave his money to his own
people.Come, don't let's waste any more time over that.What we've got
to decide is what to DO.First, of course, we must order expensive
mourning all around.""I
never thought--" He stopped abruptly, his face almost purple.Bessie Blaisdell had the floor."Why, mother, I look perfectly horrid in black, you know I do," she was
wailing."And there's the Gaylords' dance just next week; and if I'm in
mourning I can't go there, nor anywhere.What's the use in having all
that money if we've got to shut ourselves up like that, and wear horrid
stuffy black, and everything?"spoke up Miss Flora, with unusual sharpness for
her.I'm sure the least we can do
in return for this wonderful gift is to show our respect and
appreciation by going into the very deepest black we can.I'm sure I'd
be glad to."Harriet had drawn her brows together in deep thought."I'm
not sure, after all, that it would be best.The letter did not say that
dear Cousin Stanley had died--he just hadn't been heard from.In that
case, I don't think we ought to do it.And it would be too bad--that
Gaylord dance is going to be the biggest thing of the season, and of
course if we WERE in black--No; on the whole, I think we won't, Bessie.Of course, in two years from now, when we get the rest, it will be
different."There's another letter to be opened in two years
from now, disposing of the rest of the property.And he was worth
millions, you know, millions!""But maybe he--er--Did it say you were to--to get those millions then?""Oh, no, it didn't SAY it, Mr.Harriet Blaisdell's smile
was a bit condescending.He just didn't give it all now because he wanted to give
himself two more years to come back in, I suppose.And, of course, if he hadn't come back by then, he would be
dead.Oh, yes, we shall get it, I'm sure."Well, I wouldn't spend them millions--till I'd got 'em,
Hattie," advised her brother-in-law dryly."I wasn't intending to, Frank," she retorted with some dignity."But
that's neither here nor there.What we're concerned with now is what to
do with what we have got.Even this will make a tremendous sensation in
Hillerton.It ought to be written up, of course, for the papers, and by
some one who knows.Why, Frank, do you
realize?We shall be rich--RICH--and all in a flash like this!I wonder
what the Pennocks will say NOW about Mellicent's not having money
enough for that precious son of theirs!Think what we can do for the
children.Think--"

"Aunt Jane, Aunt Jane, is ma here?"Wide open banged the front door as
Benny bounded down the hall.Tommy
Hooker says our great-grandfather in Africa has died an' left us a
million dollars, an' that we're richer'n Mr.Pennock or even the
Gaylords, or anybody!"Not quite, Benny, though we have been left a nice little fortune by
your cousin, Stanley G. Fulton--remember the name, dear, your cousin,
Stanley G. Fulton.And it wasn't Africa, it was South America.""And did you all get some, too?"panted Benny, looking eagerly about
him."We sure did," nodded his Uncle Frank, "all but poor Mr.Stanley G. Fulton didn't know he was a cousin, too," he
joked, with a wink in Mr.She got some, too, didn't
she?"Your Aunt Maggie is not a Blaisdell at all.She's a Duff--a very different family.""I don't care, she's just as good as a Blaisdell," cut in Mellicent;
"and she seems like one of us, anyway.""Say," he turned
valiantly to Mr.Smith, "shouldn't you think he might have given Aunt
Maggie a little of that money?""I guess he would if he'd known her!"Once more the peculiar earnestness vibrated
through Mr."But now he's dead, an' he can't.I guess if he could see Aunt Maggie
he'd wish he hadn't died 'fore he could fix her up just as good as the
rest."Smith was laughing now, but his voice was
just as emphatic, and there was a sudden flame of color in his face."Your Cousin Stanley isn't dead, my dear,--that is, we are not sure he
is dead," spoke up Benny's mother quickly."He just has not been heard
from for six months.""But he must be dead, or he'd have come back," reasoned Miss Flora,
with worried eyes; "and I, for my part, think we OUGHT to go into
mourning, too.""Of course he'd have come back," declared Mrs.Jane, "and kept the
money himself.Don't you suppose he knew what he'd written in that
letter, and don't you suppose he'd have saved those three hundred
thousand dollars if he could?"Well, anyhow, we're not going into mourning till we have to."Harriet's lips snapped together with firm decision.I'm sure I don't see any use in having the money if
we've got to wear black and not go anywhere," pouted Bessie."Are we rich, then, really, ma?""Richer 'n the Pennocks?""Well--hardly that"--her face clouded perceptibly--"that is, not until
we get the rest--in two years.""Then, if we're rich we can have everything we want, can't we?"Benny's
eyes were beginning to sparkle."I guess there'll be enough to satisfy your wants, Benny," laughed his
Uncle Frank."Then we can go back to the East Side and live just as we've a mind to,
without carin' what other folks do, can't we?""Cause if we
ARE rich we won't have ter keep tryin' ter make folks THINK we are.The rest were laughing; but Benny's mother had raised shocked
hands of protest.We shall live in a house of our own, now, of course--but it won't be on
the East Side.""And Fred'll go to college," put in Miss Flora eagerly."Yes; and I shall send Bessie to a fashionable finishing school," bowed
Mrs."Hey, Bess, you've got ter be finished," chuckled Benny.pouted Bessie, looking not altogether
pleased."Hasn't she got to be finished, too?""Mellicent hasn't got the money to be finished--yet," observed Mrs."Oh, I don't know what I'm going to do," breathed Mellicent, drawing an
ecstatic sigh."But I hope I'm going to do--just what I want to, for
once!""And I'll make you some pretty dresses that you can wear right off,
while they're in style," beamed Miss Flora.Frank Blaisdell gave a sudden laugh."But what are YOU going to do, Flo?Here you've been telling what
everybody else is going to do with the money."A blissful sigh, very like Mellicent's own, passed Miss Flora's lips."Oh, I don't know," she breathed in an awe-struck voice."It don't seem
yet--that it's really mine.""Well, 't isn't," declared Mrs."And
I, for one, am going back to work--in the kitchen, where I belong.And--Well, if here ain't Jim at last," she broke off, as her younger
brother-in-law appeared in the doorway."You're too late, pa, you're too late!"I knew they would have, Benny; and I haven't been needed, I'm
sure,--your mother's here."Harriet bridled, but did not look unpleased."But, say, Jim," breathed Miss Flora, "ain't it wonderful--ain't it
perfectly wonderful?""It is, indeed,--very wonderful," replied Mr.Jim

A Babel of eager voices arose then, but Mr.Jim's face, and trying to fathom its
expression.A little later, when the women had gone into the kitchen and Mr.Frank
had clattered back to his work downstairs, Mr.Smith thought he had the
explanation of that look on Mr.Jim and Beany were
standing over by the fireplace together."Pa, ain't you glad--about the money?""I should be, shouldn't I, my son?""But you look--so funny, and you didn't say anything, hardly."The man, with his eyes fixed on the glowing
coals in the grate, appeared not to have heard.But in a moment he
said:--

"Benny, if a poor old horse had been climbing a long, long hill all day
with the hot sun on his back, and a load that dragged and dragged at
his heels, and if he couldn't see a thing but the dust of the road that
blinded and choked him, and if he just felt that he couldn't go another
step, in spite of the whip that snapped 'Get there--get there!'all day
in his ears--how do you suppose that poor old horse would feel if
suddenly the load, and the whip, and the hill, and the dust
disappeared, and he found himself in a green pasture with the cool
gurgle of water under green trees in his ears--how do you suppose that
poor old horse would feel?""Say, he'd like it great, wouldn't he?But, pa, you didn't tell me yet
if you liked the money."The man stirred, as if waking from a trance.He threw his arm around
Benny's shoulders.Why, of course, I like it, Benny, my boy!Why, I'm going to
have time now--to get acquainted with my children!"Smith, with a sudden tightening of his throat,
slipped softly into the hall and thence to his own room.Smith,
just then, did not wish to be seen.CHAPTER X

WHAT DOES IT MATTER?The days immediately following the receipt of three remarkable letters
by the Blaisdell family were nerve-racking for all concerned.Jane's insistence that they weren't sure yet that the thing was
true, the family steadfastly refused to give out any definite
information.Even the eager Harriet yielded to Jane on this point,
acknowledging that it WOULD be mortifying, of course, if they SHOULD
talk, and nothing came of it.Their enigmatic answers to questions, and their expressive shrugs and
smiles, however, were almost as exciting as the rumors themselves; and
the Blaisdells became at once a veritable storm center of surmises and
gossip--a state of affairs not at all unpleasing to some of them, Mrs.Miss Maggie Duff, however, was not so well pleased.Smith, one
day, she freed her mind--and Miss Maggie so seldom freed her mind that
Mr."I wish," she began, "I do wish that if that Chicago lawyer is coming,
he'd come, and get done with it!Certainly the present state of affairs
is almost unbearable.""It does make it all the harder for you, to have it drag along like
this, doesn't it?""That you are not included in the bequest, I mean."Besides, as I've told
you before, there is no earthly reason why I should have been included.It's the delay, I mean, for the Blaisdells--for the whole town, for
that matter.and 'They say' is getting on
my nerves!""Why, Miss Maggie, I didn't suppose you HAD any nerves," bantered the
man."But even the gossip and the questioning aren't the worst.Between Hattie's pulling one way and Jane the other,
I feel like a bone between two quarrelsome puppies.Hattie is already
house-hunting, on the sly, and she's bought Bessie an expensive watch
and a string of gold beads.Jane, on the other hand, insists that Mr.Fulton will come back and claim the money, so she's running her house
now on the principle that she's LOST a hundred thousand dollars, and so
must economize in every possible way."I don't have to--imagine it," murmured the man.Flora, poor soul, went into a restaurant the other day and
ordered roast turkey, and now she's worrying for fear the money won't
come and justify her extravagance.Mellicent, with implicit faith that
the hundred thousand is coming wants to wear her best frocks every day.And, as if she were not already quite excited enough, young Pennock has
very obviously begun to sit up and take notice.""You don't mean he is trying to come back--so soon!""Well, he's evidently caught the glitter of the gold from afar," smiled
Miss Maggie."At all events, he's taking notice.""Doesn't see him, APPARENTLY.But she comes and tells me his every last
move (and he's making quite a number of them just now!), so I think she
does see--a little."She's just excited now, as any young girl would
be; and I'm afraid she's taking a little wicked pleasure in--not seeing
him.""But it's all bad--this delay," chafed Miss Maggie again.That's why I do wish that
lawyer would come, if he's coming.""I reckon he'll be here before long," murmured Mr.Smith, with an
elaborately casual air."But--I wish you were coming in on the deal."His kindly eyes were gazing straight into her face now."I'm a Duff, not a Blaisdell--except when they want--" She bit her lip."I mean, I'm not a Blaisdell at all,"
she finished hastily."You're not a Blaisdell--except when they want something of you!""Oh PLEASE, I didn't mean to say--I DIDN'T say--THAT," cried Miss
Maggie, in very genuine distress."No, I know you didn't, but I did," flared the man."Miss Maggie, it's
a downright shame--the way they impose on you sometimes."I like to have them--I mean, I like to do what I can for
them," she corrected hastily, laughing in spite of herself."You like to get all tired out, I suppose.""And it doesn't matter, anyway, of course," he gibed.Smith was still sitting erect, still
speaking with grim terseness."But let me tell you right here and now
that I don't approve of that doctrine of yours.""That 'It-doesn't-matter' doctrine of yours.I tell you it's very
pernicious--very!"Oh, well--it doesn't matter--if
you don't."He caught the twinkle in her eyes and threw up his hands despairingly.With a sudden businesslike air of determination Miss Maggie faced him."Just what is the matter with that doctrine, please, and what do you
mean?""I mean that things DO matter, and that we merely shut our eyes to the
real facts in the case when we say that they don't.War, death, sin,
evil--the world is full of them, and they do matter."I never say 'It doesn't matter' to war, or
death, or sin, or evil.But there are other things--"

"But the other things matter, too," interrupted the man irritably."Right here and now it matters that you don't share in the money; it
matters that you slave half your time for a father who doesn't anywhere
near appreciate you; it matters that you slave the rest of the time for
every Tom and Dick and Harry and Jane and Mehitable in Hillerton that
has run a sliver under a thumb, either literally or metaphorically.It
matters that--"

But Miss Maggie was laughing merrily.Smith, you
don't know what you are saying!"It's YOU who don't know what you are saying!""But, pray, what would you have me say?""I'd have you say it DOES matter, and I'd have you insist on having
your rights, every time."The man fell back, so sudden and so astounding was the change that had
come to the woman opposite him.She was leaning forward in her chair,
her lips trembling, her eyes a smouldering flame."What if I had insisted on my rights, all the way up?""Would I have come home that first time from college?Would I have
stepped into Mother Blaisdell's shoes and kept the house?Would I have
swept and baked and washed and ironed, day in and day out, to make a
home for father and for Jim and Frank and Flora?Would I have come back
again and again, when my beloved books were calling, calling, always
calling?Would I have seen other girls love and marry and go to homes
of their own, while I--Oh, what am I saying, what am I saying?"she
choked, covering her eyes with the back of her hand, and turning her
face away."Please, if you can, forget what I said.Indeed, I
NEVER--broke out like that--before.Smith, on his feet, was trying to
work off his agitation by tramping up and down the small room."But I am ashamed," moaned Miss Maggie, her face still averted."And I
can't think why I should have been so--so wild.It was just something
that you said--about my rights, I think.You see--all my life I've just
HAD to learn to say 'It doesn't matter,' when there were so many things
I wanted to do, and couldn't.And--don't you see?--I found out, after a
while, that it didn't really matter, half so much--college and my own
little wants and wishes as that I should do--what I had to do,
willingly and pleasantly at home.""But, good Heavens, how could you keep from tearing 'round and throwing
things?"I--I smashed a bowl once, and two cups."She
laughed shamefacedly, and met his eyes now."But I soon found--that it
didn't make me or anybody else--any happier, and that it didn't help
things at all.So I tried--to do the other way.And now, please, PLEASE
say you'll forget all this--what I've been saying.Smith turned on his heel and marched up and down the
room again.Stanley G. Fulton, if you must know, for not giving you any of
that money."Miss Maggie threw out both her hands with a
gesture of repulsion."If I've heard that word once, I've heard it a
hundred times in the last week.Sometimes I wish I might never hear it
again.""You don't want to be deaf, do you?Well, you'd have to be, to escape
hearing that word."But--" again she threw out her hands."Don't you WANT--money, really?"We have to have money, too; but
I don't think it's--everything in the world, by any means.""You don't think it brings happiness, then?""Most of--er--us would be willing to take the risk.""Now, in the case of the Blaisdells here--don't you think this money is
going to bring happiness to them?"Smith, with a concern all out of
proportion to his supposed interest in the matter, "you don't mean to
say you DON'T think this money is going to bring them happiness!"This money'll bring them happiness all right, of
course,--particularly to some of them.But I was just wondering; if you
don't know how to spend five dollars so as to get the most out of it,
how will you spend five hundred, or five hundred thousand--and get the
most out of that?"CHAPTER XI

SANTA CLAUS ARRIVES


It was not long after this that Mr.Smith found a tall, gray-haired
man, with keen gray eyes, talking with Mrs.Jane Blaisdell and
Mellicent in the front room over the grocery store.Smith, a joyful light of recognition in his eyes.Then suddenly he stooped and picked up something from the floor.When
he came upright his face was very red.He did not look at the tall,
gray-haired man again as he advanced into the room.Smith, it's the lawyer--he's come.Jane Blaisdell to the
keen-eyed man, who, also, for no apparent reason, had grown very red.Smith's a Blaisdell, too,--distant, you know.He's doing a
Blaisdell book."The lawyer smiled
and held out his hand, but there was an odd constraint in his manner."So you're a Blaisdell, too, are you?"Smith, smiling straight into the lawyer's eyes."But not near enough to come in on the money, of course," explained
Mrs."He isn't a Hiller-Blaisdell.He's just boarding here, while
he writes his book.So he isn't near enough to come in--on the money."This time
it was the lawyer who was smiling straight into Mr.A sudden question from Mellicent seemed
to freeze the smile on his lips.Norton, please, what was Mr."Why--er--you must have seen his pictures in the papers," stammered the
lawyer.Smith with a bland
smile, as he seated himself."Why--er--" The lawyer came to a still more unhappy pause."Of course, we've seen his pictures," broke in Mellicent, "but those
don't tell us anything.So won't you tell us what he
was like, please, while we're waiting for father to come up?Was he
nice and jolly, or was he stiff and haughty?Smith, for some
reason, seemed to be highly amused.Oh, just an ordinary man, you know,--somewhat conceited, of
course."(A queer little half-gasp came from Mr.Smith, but the lawyer
was not looking at Mr."Eccentric--you've heard that, probably.And he HAS done crazy things, and no mistake.Of course, with his money
and position, we won't exactly say he had bats in his belfry--isn't
that what they call it?--but--"

Mr.Smith gave a real gasp this time, and Mrs.Jane Blaisdell
ejaculated:--

"There, I told you so!And now he'll come
back and claim the money.And if we've gone and
spent any of it--" A gesture of despair finished her sentence."Give yourself no uneasiness on that score, madam," the lawyer assured
her gravely."I think I can safely guarantee he will not do that.""I did not say that, madam.I said I was very sure he would not come
back and claim this money that is to be paid over to your husband and
his brother and sister.Dead or alive, he has no further power over
that money now."Smith says we've probably got to pay a tax on it," thrust in
Mrs."Do you know how much we'll HAVE to pay?And isn't there any way we can save doing that?"Norton could answer, a heavy step down the hall heralded Mr.Frank Blaisdell's advance, and in the ensuing confusion of his arrival,
Mr.As he passed the lawyer, however, Mellicent
thought she heard him mutter, "You rascal!"But afterwards she
concluded she must have been mistaken, for the two men appeared to
become at once the best of friends.Norton remained in town several
days, and frequently she saw him and Mr.Smith chatting pleasantly
together, or starting off apparently for a walk.Mellicent was very
sure, therefore, that she must have been mistaken in thinking she had
heard Mr.Smith utter so remarkable an exclamation as he left the room
that first day.Norton in Hillerton, and for some days
afterward, the Blaisdells were too absorbed in the mere details of
acquiring and temporarily investing their wealth to pay attention to
anything else.Robert Chalmers,
and the heads of two other Hillerton banks, the three legatees set
themselves to the task of "finding a place to put it," as Miss Flora
breathlessly termed it.Hattie said that, for her part, she should like to leave their
share all in the bank: then she'd have it to spend whenever she wanted
it.She yielded to the shocked protestations of the others, however,
and finally consented that her husband should invest a large part of it
in the bonds he so wanted, leaving a generous sum in the bank in her
own name.She was assured that the bonds were just as good as money,
anyway, as they were the kind that were readily convertible into cash.Jane, when she understood the matter, was for investing every cent
of theirs where it would draw the largest interest possible.Jane
had never before known very much about interest, and she was fascinated
with its delightful possibilities.She spent whole days joyfully
figuring percentages, and was awakened from her happy absorption only
by the unpleasant realization that her husband was not in sympathy with
her ideas at all.He said that the money was his, not hers, and that,
for once in his life, he was going to have his way."His way" in this
case proved to be the prompt buying-out of the competing grocery on the
other corner, and the establishing of good-sized bank account.The rest
of the money he said Jane might invest for a hundred per cent, if she
wanted to.Jane was pleased to this extent, and asked if it were possible that she
could get such a splendid rate as one hundred per cent.She was not so pleased later, when Mr.Norton and the
bankers told her what she COULD get--with safety; and she was very
angry because they finally appealed to her husband and she was obliged
to content herself with a paltry five or six per cent, when there were
such lovely mining stocks and oil wells everywhere that would pay so
much more.She told Flora that she ought to thank her stars that SHE had the money
herself in her own name, to do just as she pleased with, without any
old-fogy men bossing her.But Flora only shivered and said "Mercy me!"and that, for her part,
she wished she didn't have to say what to do with it.She was scared
of her life of it, anyway, and she was just sure she should lose it,
whatever she did with it; and she'most wished she didn't have it, only
it would be nice, of course, to buy things with it--and she supposed
she would buy things with it, after a while, when she got used to it,
and was not afraid to spend it.Miss Flora was, indeed, quite breathless most of the time, these days.She tried very hard to give the kind gentlemen who were helping her no
trouble, and she showed herself eager always to take their advice.But
she wished they would not ask her opinion; she was always afraid to
give it, and she didn't have one, anyway; only she did worry, of
course, and she had to ask them sometimes if they were real sure the
places they had put her money were perfectly safe, and just couldn't
blow up.It was so comforting always to see them smile, and hear them
say: "Perfectly, my dear Miss Flora, perfectly!To be sure, one day, the big fat man, not Mr.Chalmers,
did snap out: "No, madam; only the Lord Almighty can guarantee a
government bond--the whole country may be blown to atoms by a volcano
to-morrow morning!"She was startled, terribly startled; but she saw at once, of course,
that it must be just his way of joking, for of course there wasn't any
volcano big enough to blow up the whole United States; and, anyway, she
did not think it was nice of him, and it was almost like swearing, to
say "the Lord Almighty" in that tone of voice.Chalmers, or to the
other man with a wart on his nose.Miss Flora had never had a check-book before, but she tried very hard
to learn how to use it, and to show herself not too stupid.She was
glad there were such a lot of checks in the book, but she didn't
believe she'd ever spend them all--such a lot of money!She had had a
savings-bank book, to be sure, but she not been able to put anything in
the bank for a long time, and she had been worrying a good deal lately
for fear she would have to draw some out, business had been so dull.But she would not have to do that now, of course, with all this money
that had come to her.They told her that she could have all the money she wanted by just
filling out one of the little slips in her check-book the way they had
told her to do it and taking it to Mr.Chalmers's bank--that there were
a good many thousand dollars there waiting for her to spend, just as
she liked; and that, when they were gone, Mr.Chalmers would tell her
how to sell some of her bonds and get more.There were other things, too, that they had told her--too many for her
to remember--something about interest, and things called coupons that
must be cut off the bonds at certain times.She tried to remember it
all; but Mr.Chalmers had been very kind and had told her not to fret.Meanwhile, he had rented her a
nice tin box (that pulled out like a drawer) in the safety-deposit
vault under the bank, where she could keep her bonds and all the other
papers--such a lot of them!--that Mr.Chalmers told her she must keep
very carefully.But it was all so new and complicated, and everybody was always talking
at once, so!No wonder, indeed, that Miss Flora was quite breathless with it all.By the time the Blaisdells found themselves able to pay attention to
Hillerton, or to anything outside their own astounding personal
affairs, they became suddenly aware of the attention Hillerton was
paying to THEM.The grocery store, the residence of Frank
Blaisdell, and Miss Flora's humble cottage might be found at nearly any
daylight hour with from one to a dozen curious-eyed gazers on the
sidewalk before them.The town paper had contained an elaborate account
of the bequest and the remarkable circumstances attending it; and
Hillerton became the Mecca of wandering automobiles for miles around.Big metropolitan dailies got wind of the affair, recognized the magic
name of Stanley G. Fulton, and sent reporters post-haste to Hillerton.Speculation as to whether the multi-millionaire was really dead was
prevalent everywhere, and a search for some clue to his reported South
American exploring expedition was undertaken in several quarters.Various rumors concerning the expedition appeared immediately, but none
of them seemed to have any really solid foundation.Interviews with the
great law firm having the handling of Mr.Fulton's affairs were
printed, but even here little could be learned save the mere fact of
the letter of instructions, upon which they had acted according to
directions, and the other fact that there still remained one more
packet--understood to be the last will and testament--to be opened in
two years' time if Mr.The lawyers were
bland and courteous, but they really had nothing to say, they declared,
beyond the already published facts.In Hillerton the Blaisdells accepted this notoriety with characteristic
variation.Miss Flora, after cordially welcoming one "nice young man,"
and telling him all about how strange and wonderful it was, and how
frightened she felt, was so shocked and distressed to find all that she
said (and a great deal that she did not say!)staring at her from the
first page of a big newspaper, that she forthwith barred her doors, and
refused to open them till she satisfied herself, by surreptitious peeps
through the blinds, that it was only a neighbor who was knocking for
admittance.An offer of marriage from a Western ranchman and another
from a Vermont farmer (both entire strangers) did not tend to lessen
her perturbation of mind.Frank, at the grocery store, rather welcomed questioners--so long as
there was a hope of turning them into customers; but his wife and
Mellicent showed almost as much terror of them as did Miss Flora
herself.James Blaisdell and Fred stoically endured such as refused to be
silenced by their brusque non-committalism.Benny, at first welcoming
everything with the enthusiasm he would accord to a circus, soon
sniffed his disdain, as at a show that had gone stale.Hattie was the only one that found in it any
real joy and comfort.Even Bessie, excited and interested as she was,
failed to respond with quite the enthusiasm that her mother showed.Hattie saw every reporter, talked freely of "dear Cousin Stanley"
and his wonderful generosity, and explained that she would go into
mourning, of course, if she knew he was really dead.She sat for two
new portraits for newspaper use, besides graciously posing for staff
photographers whenever requested to do so; and she treasured carefully
every scrap of the printed interviews or references to the affair that
she could find.She talked with the townspeople, also, and told Al
Smith how fine it was that he could have something really worth while
for his book.Smith, these days, was keeping rather closely to his work,
especially when reporters were in evidence.He had been heard to
remark, indeed, that he had no use for reporters.Certainly he fought
shy of those investigating the Fulton-Blaisdell legacy.He read the
newspaper accounts, though, most attentively, particularly the ones
from Chicago that Mr.It was in one
of these papers that he found this paragraph:--

There seems to be really nothing more that can be learned about the
extraordinary Stanley G. Fulton-Blaisdell affair.The bequests have
been paid, the Blaisdells are reveling in their new wealth, and Mr.There is nothing now to do but to await
the opening of the second mysterious packet two years hence.This, it
is understood, is the final disposition of his estate; and if he is
really dead, such will doubtless prove to be the case.There are those,
however, who, remembering the multi-millionaire's well-known
eccentricities, are suspecting him of living in quiet retirement
somewhere, laughing in his sleeve at the tempest in the teapot that he
has created; and that long before the two years are up, he will be back
on Chicago's streets, debonair and smiling as ever.The fact that so
little can be found in regard to the South American exploring
expedition might give color to this suspicion; but where on this
terrestrial ball could Mr.Stanley G. Fulton find a place to live in
UNREPORTED retirement?Smith did not show this paragraph to the Blaisdells.He destroyed
the paper containing it, indeed, promptly and effectually--with a
furtive glance over his shoulder as he did so.It was at about this
time, too, that Mr.Smith began to complain of his eyes and to wear
smoked glasses.Smith," said Benny, the first time he saw
him."Why, I didn't hardly know you!"Smith, with suddenly a beaming
countenance."Oh, well, that doesn't matter, does it?"Smith
gave an odd little chuckle as he turned away.CHAPTER XII

THE TOYS RATTLE OUT


Early in December Mrs.Hattie, after an extended search, found a
satisfactory home.It was a somewhat pretentious house, not far from
the Gaylord place.Hattie had it repapered and repainted
throughout and two new bathrooms put in.(She said that everybody who
was anybody always had lots of bathrooms.)Then she set herself to
furnishing it.She said that, of course, very little of their old
furniture would do at all.She was talking to Maggie Duff about it one
day when Mr.She was radiant that afternoon
in a handsome silk dress and a new fur coat."You're looking very well--and happy, Mrs."I am well, and I'm perfectly happy, Mr.You know about the new home, of course.Well, it's all
ready, and I'm ordering the furnishings.Oh, you don't know what it
means to me to be able at last to surround myself with all the
beautiful things I've so longed for all my life!""I'm very glad, I'm sure."Smith said the words as if he meant them."Yes, of course; and poor Maggie here, she says she's glad, too,--though
I don't see how she can be, when she never got a cent, do you, Mr.But, poor Maggie, she's got so used to being left out--"

"Hush, hush!""You'll find money isn't everything in this world, Hattie Blaisdell,"
growled Mr.Duff, who, to-day, for some unknown reason, had deserted
the kitchen cookstove for the living-room base-burner."And when I see
what a little money does for some folks I'm glad I'm poor.I wouldn't
be rich if I could.Furthermore, I'll thank you to keep your sympathy
at home."Why, Father Duff," bridled Mrs.Hattie indignantly, "you know how poor
Maggie has had to--"

"Er--but tell us about the new home," interrupted Mr.Smith quickly,
"and the fine new furnishings.""Why, there isn't much to tell yet--about the furnishings, I mean.But I can tell you what I'm GOING to have."Hattie settled herself more comfortably, and began to look happy again."As I was saying to Maggie, when you came in, I shall get almost
everything new--for the rooms that show, I mean,--for, of course, my
old things won't do at all.I want
oil paintings, of course, in gilt frames."She glanced a little
disdainfully at the oak-framed prints on Miss Maggie's walls."Going in for old masters, maybe," suggested Mr.Duff, with a sarcasm
that fell pointless at Mrs."I'm going to have anything
old in my house--where it can be seen--For once I'm going to have NEW
things--all new things.You have to make a show or you won't be
recognized by the best people.""But, Hattie, my dear," began Miss Maggie, flushing a little, and
carefully avoiding Mr.Smith's eyes, "old masters are--are very
valuable, and--"

"I don't care if they are," retorted Mrs."If
they're old, I don't want them, and that settles it.I'm going to have
velvet carpets and the handsomest lace curtains that I can find; and
I'm going to have some of those gold chairs, like the Pennocks have,
only nicer.Theirs are awfully dull, some of them.And I'm going to
buy--"

"Humph!Pity you can't buy a little common sense--somewhere!"snarled
old man Duff, getting stiffly to his feet."You'll need it, to swing
all that style.""Oh, I don't mind what Father Duff says," laughed Mrs.But
there was a haughty tilt to her chin and an angry sparkle in her eyes
as she, too, arose."I'm just going, anyway, so you don't need to
disturb yourself, Father Duff."But Father Duff, with another "Humph!"and a muttered something about
having all he wanted already of "silly chatter," stamped out into the
kitchen, with the usual emphasis of his cane at every other step.It was just as well, perhaps, that he went, for Mrs.Hattie Blaisdell
had been gone barely five minutes when her sister-in-law, Mrs."I've come to see you about a very important matter, Maggie," she
announced, as she threw off her furs--not new ones--and unbuttoned her
coat--which also was not new."Then certainly I will take myself out of the way," said Mr.Smith,
with a smile, making a move to go."Part of it
concerns you, and I'm glad you're here, anyway.I'm afraid I shall have to give up boarding you, and one thing I
came to-day for was to ask Maggie if she'd take you.I wanted to give
poor Maggie the first chance at you, of course."Smith laughed,--but unmistakably he blushed."The
first--But, my dear woman, it is just possible that Miss Maggie may
wish to--er--decline this great honor which is being conferred upon
her, and she may hesitate, for the sake of my feelings, to do it before
me.NOW I'm very sure I ought to have left at once."(Was Miss Maggie blushing the least bit, too?)"I shall be
very glad to take Mr.Smith as a boarder if he wants to come--but HE'S
got something to say about it, remember.But tell me, why are you
letting him go, Jane?""Now this surely WILL be embarrassing," laughed
Mr."Do I eat too much, or am I merely noisy,
and a nuisance generally?"She was looking at Miss
Maggie, her eyes somber, intent.She says it's perfectly absurd for me to take boarders, with all
our money; and she's making a terrible fuss about where we live.She
says she's ashamed--positively ashamed of us--that we haven't moved
into a decent place yet."Miss Maggie's lips puckered a little."Y-yes, only it will cost so much.I've always wanted a house--with a
yard, I mean; and 'twould be nice for Mellicent, of course.""Y-yes, I know I have; but it'll cost so much, Maggie.It costs not only the money itself, but all the interest that the money
could be earning.Why, Maggie, I never saw anything like it."Her face
grew suddenly alert and happy."I never knew before how much money,
just MONEY, could earn, while you didn't have to do a thing but sit
back and watch it do it.It's the most fascinating thing I ever saw.I
counted up the other day how much we'd have if we didn't spend a cent
of it for ten years--the legacy, I mean.""Aren't you going to
spend any of that money before ten years' time?"The anxious frown came again to her
face.We have spent a lot of it, already.Frank has
bought out that horrid grocery across the street, and he's put a lot in
the bank, and he spends from that every day, I know.And I'm WILLING to
spend some, of course.But we had to pay so much inheritance tax and
all that it would be my way not to spend much till the interest had
sort of made that up, you know; but Frank and Mellicent--they won't
hear to it a minute.They want to move, too, and they're teasing me all
the time to get new clothes, both for me and for her.I can't do a thing with Hattie.You say yourself you'd like to," answered Miss Maggie
promptly.Smith leaped to his feet and thrust his hands into his pockets as
he took a nervous turn about the room, before he spoke."Good Heavens, woman, that money was given you to--that is, it was
probably given you to use."But I am using it," argued Mrs."I think I'm making
the very best possible use of it when I put it where it will earn more.Besides, what does the Bible say about that man with one
talent that didn't make it earn more?"Smith turned on his heel and renewed his march."I think the only thing money is good for is to exchange it for
something you want," observed Miss Maggie sententiously.She gazed at Miss Maggie with
fondly reproving eyes."Yes, we all know your ideas of money, Maggie.You're very sweet and
dear, and we love you; but you ARE extravagant."You use everything you have every day; and you never protect a
thing.Actually, I don't believe there's a tidy or a linen slip in this
house."Smith breathe a fervent "Thank the Lord!""And that brings me right up to something else I was going
to say.I want you to know that I'm going to help you."Miss Maggie looked distressed and raised a protesting hand; but Mrs.Jane smilingly shook her head and went on.I always said I should, if I had money, and I shall--though
I must confess that I'd have a good deal more heart to do it if you
weren't quite so extravagant.But again she only smilingly shook her head and continued speaking."And if we move, I'm going to give you the parlor carpet, and some rugs
to protect it.""Thank you; but, really, I don't want the parlor carpet," refused Miss
Maggie, a tiny smouldering fire in her eyes."And I shall give you some money, too," smiled Mrs.Jane, very
graciously,--"when the interest begins to come in, you know.It's too bad you should have nothing while I
have so much."The smouldering fire in Miss Maggie's eyes had become a
flame now."Nonsense, Maggie, you mustn't be so proud.Wasn't I poor just the other day?However, since it distresses you so,
we won't say any more about it now.Then, you advise me--you both advise me--to move, do you?""I do, most certainly," bowed Miss Maggie, still with a trace of
constraint."For Heaven's sake, lady, go home, and spend--some of that money!""Well, I don't see but what I shall have to, with everybody against me
like this," she sighed, getting slowly to her feet."But if you
knew--if either of you knew--how really valuable money is, and how much
it would earn for you, if you'd only let it, I don't believe you'd be
quite so fast to tell me to go and spend it.""Perhaps not; but then, you see, we don't know," smiled Miss Maggie,
once again her cheery self.Smith faced Miss Maggie with a quizzical
smile."You mean--"

"I'm awaiting orders--as your new boarder."They'll not be alarming, I assure you.And I think it's mighty good of you to take me.But--SHOULD you, do you think?Haven't you got enough, with your father
to care for?Won't it be too hard for you?"Annabelle and Florence
Martin, a farmer's daughters are very anxious to be in town to attend
school this winter, and I have said that I would take them."I can imagine how much work you'll let them do!It strikes me the
'help' is on the other foot.I shall be
glad enough to come, and I'll stay--unless I find you're doing too much
and going beyond your strength.I'll arrange that he proposes the idea himself.Besides,"--she twinkled merrily--"you really get along wonderfully with
father, you know.And, as for the work--I shall have more time now:
Hattie will have some one else to care for her headaches, and Jane
won't put down any more carpets, I fancy, for a while.""Honestly, Miss Maggie, one of the
best things about this Blaisdell money, in my eyes, is that it may give
you a little rest from being chief cook and bottle washer and head
nurse combined, on tap for any minute.But, say, that woman WILL spend
some of that money, won't she?"I saw Frank last evening--though I didn't think it
necessary to say so to her.I think you'll find that
they move very soon, and that the ladies of the family have some new
clothes."Er--ah--well, I am," he asserted stoutly."Such a windfall
of wealth ought to bring happiness, I think; and it seemed to, to Mrs.Hattie, though, of course, she'll learn better, as time goes on how to
spend her money.Jane--And, by the way, how is Miss Flora
bearing up--under the burden?"And do I hear 'Poor Maggie' say 'Poor Flora'?""Oh, she won't be 'poor' long," smiled Miss Maggie."She'll get used to
it--this stupendous sum of money--one of these days.But just now she's
nearly frightened to death.""Yes-both because she's got it, and because she's afraid she'll lose
it.That doesn't sound logical, I know, but Flora isn't being logical
just now.To begin with, she hasn't the least idea how to spend money.Under my careful guidance, however, she has bought her a few new
dresses--though they're dead black--"

"Black!""Yes, she's put on mourning," smiled Miss Maggie, as he came to a
dismayed stop.She declared she wouldn't feel half
decent unless she did, with that poor man dead, and giving her all that
money.""But he isn't dead--that is, they aren't sure he's dead," amended Mr.She says he must be, or he would have appeared
in time to save all that money.She's very much shocked, especially at
Hattie, that there is so little respect being shown his memory.So she
is all the more determined to do the best she can on her part.""But she--she didn't know him, so she can't--er--really MOURN for him,"
stammered the man.There was a most curious helplessness on Mr."No, she says she can't really mourn," smiled Miss Maggie again, "and
that's what worries her the most of anything--because she CAN'T mourn,
and when he's been so good to her--and he with neither wife nor chick
nor child TO mourn for him, she says.But she's determined to go
through the outward form of it, at least.So she's made herself some
new black dresses, and she's bought a veil.Fulton's
picture (she had one cut from a magazine, I believe), and has had it
framed and, hung on her wall.On the mantel beneath it she keeps fresh
flowers always.She says it's the nearest she can come to putting
flowers on his grave, poor man!""And she doesn't go anywhere, except to church, and for necessary
errands.""That explains why I haven't seen her.I've
persuaded her to do that.She'll go with a party, of course,--one of
those 'personally conducted' affairs, you know.All her life she's wanted to see Niagara.Now she's going, and
she can hardly believe it's true.She wants a phonograph, too, but
she's decided not to get that until after six months' mourning is
up--it's too frivolous and jolly for a house of mourning.""It is funny, isn't it, that she takes it quite so seriously?Bessie
suggested (I'm afraid Bessie was a little naughty!)that she get the
phonograph, but not allow it to play anything but dirges and hymn
tunes.""But isn't the woman going to take ANY comfort with that money?"Smith,
what it means to her, to feel that she need never want again, and that
she can buy whatever she pleases, without thinking of the cost.That's
why she's frightened--because she IS so happy.She thinks it can't be
right to be so happy.When she isn't
being frightened about that, she's being frightened for fear she'll
lose it, and thus not have it any more.I don't think she quite
realizes yet what a big sum of money it is, and that she'd have to lose
a great deal before she lost it all.""Oh, well, she'll get used to that, in time.They'll all get used to
it--in time," declared Mr."Then
they'll begin to live sanely and sensibly, and spend the money as it
should be spent.Of course, you couldn't expect them to know what to
do, at the very first, with a sum like that dropped into their laps.Smith, his face suddenly alert and interested again."What would you do
if you should fall heir to a hundred thousand dollars--to-morrow?"Her eyes became luminous, unfathomable."There is so much that a hundred thousand dollars could do--so much!Why, I would--" Her face changed again abruptly.She sniffed as at an
odor from somewhere.Then lightly she sprang to her feet and crossed to
the stove."What would I do with a hundred thousand dollars?"she
demanded, whisking open a damper in the pipe."I'd buy a new
base-burner that didn't leak gas!That's what I'd do with a hundred
thousand dollars.I wasn't thinking of charging quite that for your board.But you seemed so interested, I didn't know but what you were going to
hand over the hundred thousand, just to see what I would do with it,"
she challenged mischievously."However, I'll stop talking nonsense, and
come down to business.New Boarder, I'll
let you choose which of two rooms you'd like."But, as had occurred once or twice before, Mr.Smith's face, as he followed her, was a study.CHAPTER XIII

THE DANCING BEGINS


Christmas saw many changes in the Blaisdell families.The James Blaisdells had moved into the big house near the Gaylord
place.Hattie had installed two maids in the kitchen, bought a
handsome touring car, and engaged an imposing-looking chauffeur.Fred
had entered college, and Bessie had been sent to a fashionable school
on the Hudson.Benny, to his disgust, had also been sent away to an
expensive school.Christmas, however, found them all at home for the
holidays, and for the big housewarming that their parents were planning
to give on Christmas night.The Frank Blaisdells had also moved.They were occupying a new house
not too far from the grocery store.Jane said that she wished to live in it awhile, so as to be sure she
would really like it.Besides, it would save the interest on the money
for that much time, anyway.True, she had been a little disturbed when
her husband reminded her that they would be paying rent meanwhile.But
she said that didn't matter; she was not going to put all that money
into a house just yet, anyway,--not till she was sure it was the best
they could do for the price.They, too, were planning a housewarming.Theirs was to come the night
after Christmas.Jane told her husband that they should not want
theirs the same night, of course, as Hattie's, and that if she had hers
right away the next night, she could eat up any of the cakes or ice
cream that was left from Hattie's party, and thus save buying so much
new for herself.But her husband was so indignant over the idea of
eating "Hattie's leavings" that she had to give up this part of her
plan, though she still arranged to have her housewarming on the day
following her sister-in-law's.Mellicent, like Bessie, was home from school, though not from the same
school.Jane had found another one that was just as good as
Bessie's, she said, and which did not cost near so much money.Smith was not living with them now, of course.He was boarding at Miss
Maggie Duff's.Miss Flora was living in the same little rented cottage she had
occupied for many years.She said that she should move, of course, when
she got through her mourning, but, until then she thought it more
suitable for her to stay where she was.She had what she wanted to eat,
now, however, and she did not do dressmaking any longer.She still did
her own housework, in spite of Harriet Blaisdell's insistence that she
get a maid.She said that there was plenty of time for all those things
when she had finished her mourning.She went out very little, though
she did go to the housewarming at her brother James's--"being a
relative, so," she decided that no criticism could be made.It seemed as if all Hillerton went to that house-warming.Those who
were not especially invited to attend went as far as the street or the
gate, and looked on enviously.Hattie had been very generous with
her invitations, however.She said that she had asked everybody who
ever pretended to go anywhere.She told Maggie Duff that, of course,
after this, she should be more exclusive--very exclusive, in fact; but
that this time Jim wanted to ask everybody, and she didn't mind so
much--she was really rather glad to have all these people see the
house, and all--they certainly never would have the chance again.Hattie had very kindly
included him in the invitation.She had asked Father Duff, too,
especially, though she said she knew, of course, that he would not
go--he never went anywhere.Father Duff bristled up at this, and
declared that he guessed he would go, after all, just to show them that
he could, if he wanted to.Hattie grew actually pale, but Miss
Maggie exclaimed joyfully that, of course, he would go--he ought to go,
to show proper respect!Father Duff said no then, very decidedly; that
nothing could hire him to go, and that he had no respect to show.He
declared that he had no use for gossip and gabble and unwholesome
eating; and he said that he should not think Maggie would care to go,
either,--unless she could be in the kitchen, where it would seem
natural to her!Hattie, however, smiled kindly, and said, of course, now she could
afford to hire better help than Maggie (caterers from the city and all
that), so Maggie would not have to be in the kitchen, and that with
practice she would soon learn not to mind at all being 'round among
folks in the parlor.Father Duff had become so apoplectically angry at this that Mr.Smith,
who chanced to be present, and who also was very angry, was forced to
forget his own wrath in his desire to make the situation easier for
Miss Maggie.He had not supposed that Miss Maggie would go at all, after that.He
had even determined not to go himself.But Miss Maggie, after a day's
thought, had laughed and had said, with her eyes twinkling: "Oh, well,
it doesn't matter, you know,--it doesn't REALLY matter, does it?"He saw almost
everybody he knew in Hillerton, and many that he did not know.He heard
the Blaisdells and their new wealth discussed from all viewpoints, and
he heard some things about the missing millionaire benefactor that were
particularly interesting--to him.The general opinion seemed to be that
the man was dead; though a few admitted that there was a possibility,
of course, that he was merely lost somewhere in darkest South America
and would eventually get back to civilization, certainly long before
the time came to open the second letter of instructions.Many professed
to know the man well, through magazine and newspaper accounts (there
were times when Mr.Smith adjusted more carefully the smoked glasses
which he was still wearing); and some had much to say of the
millionaire's characteristics, habits, and eccentricities; all of which
Mr.Then, too, there were the Blaisdells themselves.They were all there,
even to Miss Flora, who was in dead black; and Mr.Miss Flora told him that she was so happy she could not sleep nights,
but that she was rather glad she couldn't sleep, after all, for she
spent the time mourning for poor Mr.Fulton, and thinking how good he
had been to her.And THAT made it seem as if she was doing SOMETHING
for him.She said, Yes, oh, yes, she was going to stop black mourning
in six months, and go into grays and lavenders; and she was glad Mr.Smith thought that was long enough, quite long enough for the black,
but she could not think for a moment of putting on colors now, as he
suggested.She said, too, that she had decided not to go to Niagara for
the present.And when he demurred at this, she told him that really she
would rather not.It would be warmer in the spring, and she would much
rather wait till she could enjoy every minute without feeling
that--well, that she was almost dancing over the poor man's grave, as
it were.He turned away, indeed, rather
precipitately--so precipitately that Miss Flora wondered if she could
have said anything to offend him.Her dress was new, and in good style,
yet she in some way looked odd to Mr.In a moment he knew the
reason: she wore no apron.Smith had never seen her without an
apron before.Even on the street she wore a black silk one.He
complimented her gallantly on her fine appearance.Thank you, of course," she answered worriedly."But it
cost an awful lot--this dress did; but Frank and Mellicent would have
it.That child!--have you seen her to-night?"She, too is looking most
charming, Mrs."Yes, I know she is--and some other folks so, too, I notice."Well, she will be, if she isn't now."But I thought--that was broken up."YOU know what that woman said--the insult!But now, since this
money came--" She let an expressive gesture complete the sentence.I don't think he'll make much
headway--now.""Indeed, he won't--if I can help myself!""I reckon he won't stand much show with Miss Mellicent--after what's
happened.""I guess he won't," snapped the woman."He isn't worth half what SHE is
now.As if I'd let her look at HIM!"There was an odd expression
on his face.Smith, I don't know what I am going to do--with
Mellicent," she sighed.She's as wild as a hawk and as--as flighty as a humming-bird,
since this money came.Smith, looking suddenly very happy
himself."Youth is the time for joy and laughter; and I'm sure I'm glad
she is taking a little pleasure in life."Smith, you know as well as I do that life isn't all pink
dresses and sugar-plums.It is a serious business, and I have tried to
bring her up to understand it.I have taught her to be thrifty and
economical, and to realize the value of a dollar.But now--she doesn't
SEE a dollar but what she wants to spend it."You aren't sorry--the money came?"Smith was eyeing her with a
quizzical smile.Blaisdell's answer was promptly emphatic."And I hope I shall be found worthy of the gift, and able to handle it
wisely.""Er-ah--you mean--" Mr."I mean that I regard wealth as one of the greatest of trusts, to be
wisely administered, Mr."That is why it distresses me so to see my daughter so carried away
with the mere idea of spending.I thought I'd taught her differently,"
sighed the woman.He found her
in the music-room, which had been cleared for dancing.She was
surrounded by four young men.One held her fan, one carried her white
scarf on his arm, a third was handing her a glass of water.The fourth
was apparently writing his name on her dance card.The one writing on the
dance programme he knew was young Hibbard Gaylord.Leaning against a window-casing
near by, he watched the kaleidoscopic throng, bestowing a not too
conspicuous attention upon the group about Miss Mellicent Blaisdell.Mellicent was the picture of radiant loveliness.The rose in her cheeks
matched the rose of her gown, and her eyes sparkled with happiness.Smith could see, she dispensed her favors with rare
impartiality; though, as he came toward them finally, he realized at
once that there was a merry wrangle of some sort afoot.He had not
quite reached them when, to his surprise, Mellicent turned to him in
very evident relief."I'm going to sit it out
with him.I shan't dance it with either of you."protested young Gaylord and Carl Pennock abjectly.If you WILL both write your names down for the same dance, it is
nothing more than you ought to expect."Mellicent shook her head again merrily."I shan't be satisfied with anything--but to sit it out with Mr.Smith," she bowed, as she took his promptly offered arm.Smith bore her away followed by the despairing groans of the
two disappointed youths and the taunting gibes of their companions.Oh, I'm so glad you came," sighed Mellicent."And it looked like a real rescue, too.""Wasn't one of them young Pennock?""Oh, yes, he's come back.I wonder if he thinks I don't know--WHY!"She shrugged her shoulders with a demure dropping of her eyes."Oh, I let him come back--to a certain extent.I shouldn't want him to
think I cared or noticed enough to keep him from coming back--some.""But there's a line beyond which he may not pass, eh?""There certainly is!--but let's not talk of him.In a secluded corner they sat down on a gilt settee."And it's all so wonderful, this--all this!Smith, I'm so happy
I--I want to cry all the time.And that's so silly--to want to cry!So long--all my life--I've had to WAIT for things so.It was
always by and by, in the future, that I was going to have--anything
that I wanted.And now to have them like this, all at once, everything
I want--why, Mr.Smith, it doesn't seem as if it could be true."But it is true, dear child; and I'm so glad--you've got your
five-pound box of candy all at once at last.And I HOPE you can treat
your friends to unlimited soda waters."A new eagerness came to her
eyes."I'm going to give mother a present--a frivolous, foolish
present, such as I've always wanted to.I'm going to give her a gold
breast-pin with an amethyst in it.And I'm
going to take my own money for it, too,--not the new money that father
gives me, but some money I've been saving up for years--dimes and
quarters and half-dollars in my baby-bank.Mother always made me save
'most every cent I got, you see.And I'm going to take it now for this
pin.She won't mind if I do spend it foolishly now--with all the rest
we have.And she'll be so pleased with the pin!""Yes, always; but she never thought she could afford it.I'm
going to open the bank to-morrow and count it; and I'm so excited over
it!"Fulton himself ever
took more joy counting his millions than I shall take in counting those
quarters and half-dollars to-morrow."Smith spoke with confident emphasis,
yet in a voice that was not quite steady.Smith," smiled Mellicent, a bit mistily.And we miss you terribly--honestly we
do!--since you went away.But I'm glad Aunt Maggie's got you.That's the only thing that makes me feel bad,--about the money,
I mean,--and that is that she didn't have some, too.But mother's going
to give her some.She SAYS she is, and--"

But Mellicent did not finish her sentence.A short, sandy-haired youth
came up and pointed an accusing finger at her dance card; and Mellicent
said yes, the next dance was his.Smith
as she floated away, and Mr.Smith, well content, turned and walked
into the adjoining room.These two
ladies, also, were pictures of radiant loveliness--especially were they
radiant, for every beam of light found an answering flash in the
shimmering iridescence of their beads and jewels and opalescent sequins.Smith, what do you think of my party?"Hattie tapped his shoulder with her fan."I think a great deal--of your party," smiled the man."Oh, it'll do--for Hillerton."Miss Bessie smiled mischievously into
her mother's eyes, shrugged her shoulders, and passed on into the
music-room."As if it wasn't quite the finest thing Hillerton ever had--except the
Gaylord parties, of course," bridled Mrs."That's just daughter's way of teasing me--and, of course, now she IS
where she sees the real thing in entertaining--she goes home with those
rich girls in her school, you know.But this is a nice party, isn't it
Mr."Daughter says we should have wine; that everybody who is anybody has
wine now--champagne, and cigarettes for the ladies.Still, I've heard the Gaylords do.I've never been there
yet, though, of course, we shall be invited now.I'm crazy to see the
inside of their house; but I don't believe it's MUCH handsomer than
this.You've never been
there, any more than I have, and you're a man of simple tastes, I
judge, Mr."Benny says that Aunt
Maggie's got the nicest house he ever saw, and that Mr.So, you see, I have grounds for my opinion.""Well, I'm not sure I ever said just that to Benny, but I'll not
dispute it.Miss Maggie's house is indeed wonderfully delightful--to
live in.""I've no doubt of it," conceded Mrs.She always did contrive to make the most of everything she had.But
she's never been ambitious for really nice things, I imagine.At least,
she always seems contented enough with her shabby chairs and carpets.While I--" She paused, looked about her, then drew a blissful sigh.Smith, you don't know--you CAN'T know what it is to me to just look
around and realize that they are all mine--these beautiful things!"Smith, there isn't a piece of furniture in this room
that didn't cost more than the Pennocks'--I know, because I've been
there.And my curtains are nicer, too, and my pictures, they're so much
brighter--some of her oil paintings are terribly dull-looking.And my
Bessie--did you notice her dress to-night?And if you had, you wouldn't have realized how expensive it
was.What do you know about the cost of women's dresses?"It was one hundred and fifty
dollars, a HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS, and it came from New York.I
don't believe that white muslin thing of Gussie Pennock's cost fifty!"Yes, of course you have--with Fred.He
goes with Pearl Gaylord more now.There, you can see them this minute,
dancing together--the one in the low-cut, blue dress.Pretty, too,
isn't she?Her father's worth a million, I suppose.I wonder how
'twould feel to be worth--a million."She spoke musingly, her eyes
following the low-cut blue dress."But, then, maybe I shall know, some
time,--from Cousin Stanley, I mean," she explained smilingly, in answer
to the question she thought she saw behind Mr."Oh, of course, there's nothing sure about it.But he gave us SOME, and
if he's dead, of course, that other letter'll be opened in two years;
and I don't see why he wouldn't give us the rest, as long as he'd shown
he remembered he'd got us."Well--er--as to that--" Mr."Well, there aren't any other relations so near, anyway, so I can't
help thinking about it, and wondering," she interposed."And 'twould be
MILLIONS, not just one million.He's worth ten or twenty, they say.But, then, we shall know in time.""Oh, yes, you'll know--in time," agreed Mr.Smith with a smile, turning
away as another guest came up to his hostess.Smith's smile had been rather forced, and his face was still
somewhat red as he picked his way through the crowded rooms to the
place where he could see Frank Blaisdell standing alone, surveying the
scene, his hands in his pockets.Smith, this is some show, ain't it?'greeted the grocer, as
Mr.I should say so--though I can't say I'm stuck on the brand,
myself.But, as for this money business, do you know?I can't sense it yet--that it's true.Ain't she swingin' the style to-night?""She certainly is looking handsome and very happy."I believe in takin'
some comfort as you go along--not that I've taken much, in times past.Why, man, I'm just like a potato-top grown in a cellar,
and I'm comin' out and get some sunshine.SHE'S been a potato-top in a cellar all right.But now--Have you
seen her to-night?""I have--and a very charming sight she was," smiled Mr."Well, she's goin' to be
that right along now.She's GOIN' where she wants to go, and DO what
she wants to do; and she's goin' to have all the fancy fluma-diddles to
wear she wants."I'm glad to hear that, too," laughed Mr.This savin' an' savin' is all very well, of course, when
you have to.But I've saved all my life and, by jingo, I'm goin' to
spend now!I'm glad to have one on my side, anyhow.I only wish--You
couldn't talk my wife 'round to your way of thinkin', could you?"he
shrugged, with a whimsical smile."My wife's eaten sour cream to save
the sweet all her life, an' she hain't learned yet that if she'd eat
the sweet to begin with she wouldn't have no sour cream--'twouldn't
have time to get sour.She eats the specked
ones always; so she don't never eat anything but the worst there is.An' she says they're the meanest apples she ever saw.Now I tell her if
she'll only pick out the best there is every time, as I do she'll not
only enjoy every apple she eats, but she'll think they're the nicest
apples that ever grew.Here I am havin' to urge my
wife to spend money, while my sister-in-law here--Talk about ducks
takin' to the water!That ain't no name for the way she sails into
Jim's little pile.""Hain't seen him--but I can guess where he is, pretty well.You go down
that hall and turn to your left.In a little room at the end you'll
find him.He told Hattie 'twas the only room in the
house he'd ask for, but he wanted to fix it up himself.Hattie, she
wanted to buy all sorts of truck and fix it up with cushions and
curtains and Japanese gimcracks like she see a den in a book, and make
a showplace of it.There ain't
nothin' in it but books and chairs and a couch and a big table; and
they're all old--except the books--so Hattie don't show it much, when
she's showin' off the house.Jim always would rather read than eat, and he hates
shindigs of this sort a little worse 'n I do."I'll look
him up," nodded Mr.Deliberately, but with apparent carelessness, strolled Mr.Smith
through the big drawing-rooms, and down the hall.Then to the left--the
directions were not hard to follow, and the door of the room at the end
was halfway open, giving a glimpse of James Blaisdell and Benny before
the big fireplace.With a gentle tap and a cheerful "Do you allow intruders?"James Blaisdell sprang to his feet.The frown on his face
gave way to a smile."I thought--Well, never mind what I thought."Thank you, if you don't mind."Smith dropped into a chair and looked about him."It's'most as nice as Aunt Maggie's,
ain't it?And I can eat all the cookies here I want to, and come in
even if my shoes are muddy, and bring the boys in, too.""It certainly is--great," agreed Mr.Smith, his admiring eyes sweeping
the room again.The deep,
comfortable chairs, the shaded lights, the leaping fire on the hearth,
the book-lined walls--even the rhythmic voices of the distant violins
seemed to sing of peace and quietness and rest."Dad's been showin' me the books he used ter like when he was a little
boy like me," announced Benny."Hain't he got a lot of 'em?--books, I
mean."James Blaisdell stirred a little in his chair."I suppose I have--crowded them a little," he admitted."But, you see,
there were so many I'd always wanted, and when the chance came--well, I
just bought them; that's all.""And you have the time now to read them.""I have, thank--Well, I suppose I should say thanks to Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton," he laughed, with some embarrassment.Fulton could
know--how much I do thank him," he finished soberly, his eyes caressing
the rows of volumes on the shelves."You see, when you've wanted
something all your life--" He stopped with an expressive gesture."You don't care much for--that, then, I take it," inferred Mr.Smith,
with a wave of his hand toward the distant violins."Dad says there's only one thing worse than a party, and that's two
parties," piped up Benny from his seat on the rug.Smith laughed heartily, but the other looked still more discomfited."I'm afraid Benny is--is telling tales out of school," he murmured."Well, 'tis out of school, ain't it?"Smith, did you have ter go ter a private school when you were a little
boy?But if it's Cousin
Stanley's money that's made us somebody, I wished he'd kept it at
home--'fore I had ter go ter that old school.""Oh, come, come, my boy," remonstrated the father, drawing his son into
the circle of his arm."That's neither kind nor grateful; besides, you
don't know what you're talking about.From case to case, then, they went, the host eagerly displaying and
explaining, the guest almost as eagerly watching and listening.And in
the kindling eye and reverent fingers of the man handling the volumes,
Mr.Smith caught some inkling of what those books meant to Jim
Blaisdell."You must be fond of--books, Mr.Blaisdell," he said somewhat
awkwardly, after a time."Ma says dad'd rather read than eat," giggled Benny; "but pa says
readin' IS eatin'.But I'd rather have a cookie, wouldn't you, Mr."You wait till you find what there IS in these books, my son," smiled
his father."You'll love them as well as I do, some day.And your
brother--" He paused, a swift shadow on his face."My boy, Fred, loves books, too.He helped me a lot in my
buying.He was in here--a little while ago.But he couldn't stay, of
course.He said he had to go and dance with the girls--his mother
expected it."Just as if he didn't want ter go himself!""You couldn't HIRE him ter stay away--'specially if Pearl
Gaylord's 'round.""Oh, well, he's young, and young feet always dance When Pan pipes,"
explained the father, with a smile that was a bit forced."But Pan
doesn't always pipe, and he's ambitious--Fred is."The man turned
eagerly to Mr."He's going to be a lawyer--you see, he's
got a chance now.He led his class in high school,
and he'll make good in college, I'm sure.He can have the best there is
now, too, without killing himself with work to get it.He's got a fine
mind, and--" The man stopped abruptly, with a shamed laugh.You'll forgive 'the fond father,' I know.I
always forget myself when I'm talking of that boy--or, rather perhaps
it's that I'm REMEMBERING myself.You see, I want him to do all that I
wanted to do--and couldn't.And--"

"Jim, JIM!""There, I might have
known where I'd find you.Come, the guests are going, and are looking
for you to say good-night.They'll think we don't know anything--how to behave, and
all that.Smith, you'll excuse him, I know.""I must be going myself, for that
matter," he finished, as he followed his hostess through the doorway.Five minutes later he had found Miss Maggie, and was making his adieus.Miss Maggie, on the way home, was strangely silent."Well, that was some party," began Mr.[Illustration with caption: "JIM, YOU'LL HAVE TO COME!"]"I'm glad at last to see that poor child enjoying herself."Smith frowned and stole a sidewise glance at his companion.Could Miss Maggie be showing at last a tinge of envy and
jealousy?And yet--

"Even Miss Flora seemed to be having a good time, in spite of that
funereal black," he hazarded again.James Blaisdell and Miss Bessie were very radiant
and shining.""Oh, yes, they--shone."Smith bit his lip, and stole another sidewise glance.James Blaisdell was so fond of--er--books.I had
quite a chat with him in his den.""He says Fred--"

"Did you see that Gaylord girl?"Miss Maggie was galvanized into sudden
life."He's perfectly bewitched with her.And she--that ridiculous
dress--and for a young girl!Oh, I wish Hattie would let those people
alone!""Oh, well, he'll be off to college next week," soothed Mr.Her brother!--and he's worse than she is, if
anything.Why, he was drunk to-night, actually drunk, when he came!I don't want Fred with any of them.""No, I don't like their looks myself very well, but--I fancy young
Blaisdell has a pretty level head on him.His father says--"

"His father worships him," interrupted Miss Maggie.But into Fred--into Fred he's pouring his whole lost
youth.You don't understand, of course, Mr.You
haven't known him all the way, as I have."Miss Maggie's voice shook
with suppressed feeling.From boyhood he was going to write--great plays, great
poems, great novels.I think he
even tried to sell his things, in his 'teens; but of course nothing
came of that--but rejection slips.Of
course, we couldn't send him.He couldn't stand
the double task, and he broke down completely.We sent him into the
country to recuperate, and there he met Hattie Snow, fell head over
heels in love with her blue eyes and golden hair, and married her on
the spot.Of course, there was nothing to do then but to go to work,
and Mr.Hammond took him into his real estate and insurance office.He's been there ever since, plodding plodding, plodding.""You can imagine there wasn't much time left for books.I think, when
he first went there, he thought he was still going to write the great
poem, the great play the great novel, that was to bring him fame and
money.Hattie had little patience with his
scribbling, and had less with the constant necessity of scrimping and
economizing.She was always ambitious to get ahead and be somebody,
and, of course, as the babies came and the expenses increased, the
demand for more money became more and more insistent.He worked, and worked hard, and then
he got a job for evenings and worked harder.But I don't believe he
ever quite caught up.That's why I was so glad when this money
came--for Jim.he's thrown his whole lost youth
into Fred.And Fred--"

"Fred is going to make good.But--I wish those Gaylords had been at the bottom of
the Red Sea before they ever came to Hillerton," she fumed with sudden
vehemence as she entered her own gate.CHAPTER XIV

FROM ME TO YOU WITH LOVE


It was certainly a gay one--that holiday week.Beginning with the James
Blaisdells' housewarming it was one continuous round of dances,
dinners, sleigh-rides and skating parties for Hillerton's young people
particularly for the Blaisdells, the Pennocks, and the Gaylords.Smith, at Miss Maggie's, saw comparatively little of it all, though
he had almost daily reports from Benny, Mellicent, or Miss Flora, who
came often to Miss Maggie's for a little chat.It was from Miss Flora
that he learned the outcome of Mellicent's present to her mother.The
week was past, and Miss Flora had come down to Miss Maggie's for a
little visit.Smith still worked at the table in the corner of the living-room,
though the Duff-Blaisdell records were all long ago copied.He was at
work now sorting and tabulating other Blaisdell records.Smith
seemed to find no end to the work that had to be done on his Blaisdell
book.As Miss Flora entered the room she greeted Mr.Smith cordially, and
dropped into a chair."Well, they've gone at last," she panted, handing her furs to Miss
Maggie; "so I thought I'd come down and talk things over.Smith," she begged, as he made a move toward departure."I hain't
come; to say nothin' private; besides, you're one of the family,
anyhow.Smith went back to his table, and Miss Flora
settled herself more comfortably in Miss Maggie's easiest chair."So they're all gone," said Miss Maggie cheerily."Yes; an' it's time they did, to my way of thinkin'.Mercy me, what a
week it has been!They hain't been still a minute, not one of 'em,
except for a few hours' sleep--toward mornin'.""But what a good time they've had!"And didn't it do your soul good to see Mellicent?But Jane--Jane
nearly had a fit.She told Mellicent that all this gayety was nothing
but froth and flimsiness and vexation of spirit.That she knew it
because she'd been all through it when she was young, and she knew the
vanity of it.And Mellicent--what do you suppose that child said?""I can't imagine," smiled Miss Maggie."She said SHE wanted to see the vanity of it, too.Pretty cute of her,
too, wasn't it?Still it's just as well she's gone back to school, I
think myself.She's been repressed and held back so long, that when she
did let loose, it was just like cutting the puckering string of a
bunched-up ruffle--she flew in all directions, and there was no holding
her back anywhere; and I suppose she has been a bit foolish and
extravagant in the things she's asked for.Poor dear, though, she did
get one setback.""Did she tell you about the present for her mother?""That she was going to get it--yes."Miss Flora's thin lips snapped grimly over the
terse words.And 'twas a beauty--one of them light purple stones with two
pearls.Mellicent showed it to me--on the way home from the store, you
know.'Oh, I don't mind the saving all
those years now,' she cried, 'when I see what a beautiful thing they've
let me get for mother' And she went off so happy she just couldn't keep
her feet from dancing."'"I can imagine it," nodded Miss Maggie."Well, in an hour she was back.All the light
and happiness and springiness were gone.She
still carried the little box in her hand.'I'm takin' it back,' she
choked."'Oh, yes, she liked the pin,' said Mellicent, all teary;'she thinks
it's beautiful.She says she never heard
of such foolish goings-on--paying all that money for a silly, useless
pin.I--I told her 'twas a PRESENT from me, but she made me take it
back.I'm on my way now back to the store.I'm to get the money, if I
can.If I can't, I'm to get a credit slip.Mother says we can take it
up in forks and spoons and things we need.I--I told her 'twas a
present, but--' She couldn't say another word, poor child.She just
turned and almost ran from the room.She went away
this morning, I suppose.I didn't see her again, so I don't know how
she did come out with the store-man."Smith had fallen to writing furiously, with vicious little jabs of his
pencil.)"But Jane never did believe in present-giving.They never gave
presents to each other even at Christmas.She always called it a
foolish, wasteful practice, and Mellicent was always SO unhappy
Christmas morning!"Jane
never let 'em take even comfort, and now that they CAN take some
comfort, Jane's got so out of the habit, she don't know how to begin.""I don't think YOU can
say much on that score.""Why, Maggie Duff, I'M taking comfort," bridled Miss Flora."Didn't I
have chicken last week and turkey three weeks ago?And do I ever skimp
the butter or hunt for cake-rules with one egg now?And ain't I going
to Niagara and have a phonograph and move into a fine place just as
soon as my mourning is up?"All right, I'll wait," laughed Miss Maggie.Then, a bit anxiously, she
asked: "Did Fred go to-day?""Yes, looking fine as a fiddle, too.I was sweeping off the steps when
he went by the house.Said he was going in now
for real work--that he'd played long enough.He said he wouldn't be
good for a row of pins if he had many such weeks as this had been.""I'm glad he realized it," observed Miss Maggie grimly."I suppose the
Gaylord young people went, too.""Hibbard did, but Pearl doesn't go till next week.She isn't in the
same school with Bess, you know.It's even grander than Bess's they
say.Hattie wants to get Bess into it next year.Oh, I forgot; we've
got to call her 'Elizabeth' now.Hattie says nicknames are all out now, and that
'Elizabeth' is very stylish and good form and the only proper thing to
call her.She says we must call her 'Harriet,' too.But I'm afraid I shall forget--sometimes.""I'm afraid--a good many of us will," laughed Miss Maggie."It all came from them Gaylords, I believe," sniffed Flora."I don't
think much of 'em; but Hattie seems to.I notice she don't put nothin'
discouragin' in the way of young Gaylord and Bess.But he pays'most as
much attention to Mellicent, so far as I can see, whenever Carl Pennock
will give him a chance.Did you ever see the beat of that boy?I hope Mellicent'll give him a good lesson, before
she gets through with it.He deserves it," she ejaculated, as she
picked up her fur neck-piece, and fastened it with a jerk.In the doorway she paused and glanced cautiously toward Mr.Smith, perceiving the glance, tried very hard to absorb himself in the
rows of names dates before him; but he could not help hearing Miss
Flora's next words."Maggie, hain't you changed your mind a mite yet?WON'T you let me give
you some of my money?But Miss Maggie, with a violent shake of her head, almost pushed Miss
Flora into the hall and shut the door firmly.Smith, left alone at his table, wrote again furiously, and with
vicious little jabs of his pencil.Smith was finding
a most congenial home.He liked Miss Maggie better than ever, on closer
acquaintance.The Martin girls fitted pleasantly into the household,
and plainly did much to help the mistress of the house.Father Duff was
still as irritable as ever, but he was not so much in evidence, for his
increasing lameness was confining him almost entirely to his own room.This meant added care for Miss Maggie, but, with the help of the
Martins, she still had some rest and leisure, some time to devote to
the walks and talks with Mr.Smith said it was absolutely
imperative, for the sake of her health, that she should have some
recreation, and that it was an act of charity, anyway, that she should
lighten his loneliness by letting him walk and talk with her.Smith could not help wondering a good deal these days about Miss
Maggie's financial resources.He knew from various indications that
they must be slender.Yet he never heard her plead poverty or preach
economy.In spite of the absence of protecting rugs and tidies,
however, and in spite of the fact that she plainly conducted her life
and household along the lines of the greatest possible comfort, he saw
many evidences that she counted the pennies--and that she made every
penny count.He knew, for a fact, that she had refused to accept any of the
Blaisdells' legacy.Jane, to be sure, had not offered any money yet
(though she had offered the parlor carpet, which had been promptly
refused), but Frank and James and Flora had offered money, and had
urged her to take it.Miss Maggie, however would have none of it.Smith suspected that Miss Maggie was proud, and that she regarded
such a gift as savoring too much of charity.Smith wished HE could
say something to Miss Maggie.Smith was, indeed, not a little
disturbed over the matter.He did try once to say something; but Miss
Maggie tossed it off with a merry: "Take their money?I should
feel as if I were eating up some of Jane's interest, or one of Hattie's
gold chairs!"After that she would not let him get near the subject.There seemed then really nothing that he could do.It was about this
time, however, that Mr.Smith began to demand certain extra
luxuries--honey, olives, sardines, candied fruits, and imported
jellies.They were always luxuries that must be bought, not prepared in
the home; and he promptly increased the price of his board--but to a
sum far beyond the extra cost of the delicacies he ordered.When Miss
Maggie remonstrated at the size of the increase, he pooh-poohed her
objections, and declared that even that did not pay for having such a
nuisance of a boarder around, with all his fussy notions.He insisted,
moreover, that the family should all partake freely of the various
delicacies, declaring that it seemed to take away the sting of his
fussiness if they ate as he ate, and so did not make him appear
singular in his tastes.They often came to Miss Maggie's, and occasionally he
called at their homes.They seemed to regard him, indeed, as quite one of the family, and they
asked his advice, and discussed their affairs before him with as much
freedom as if he were, in truth, a member of the family.Hattie Blaisdell was having a very gay winter, and
that she had been invited twice to the Gaylords'.He knew that James
Blaisdell was happy in long evenings with his books before the fire.From Fred's mother he learned that Fred had made the most exclusive
club in college, and from Fred's father he learned that the boy was
already leading his class in his studies.He heard of Bessie's visits
to the homes of wealthy New Yorkers, and of the trials Benny's teachers
were having with Benny.He knew something of Miss Flora's placid life in her "house of
mourning" (as Bessie had dubbed the little cottage), and he heard of
the "perfectly lovely times" Mellicent was having at her finishing
school.He dropped in occasionally to talk over the price of beans and
potatoes with Mr.Frank Blaisdell in his bustling grocery store, and he
often saw Mrs.It was at Miss Maggie's, indeed,
one day, that he heard Mrs.Jane say, as she sank wearily into a
chair:--

"Well, I declare!Sometimes I think I'll never give anybody a thing
again!"Smith, at his table, was conscious of a sudden lively interest.So
often, in his earlier acquaintance with Mrs.Jane, while he boarded
there, had he heard her say to mission-workers, church-solicitors, and
doorway beggars, alike, something similar to this; "No, I can give you
nothing.I'd love to, if I could--really I
would.It makes me quite unhappy to hear of all this need and
suffering.And if I were rich I would; but
as it is, I can only give you my sympathy and my prayers."He had wondered several times,
since the money came, as to Mrs.Hence his interest now
in what she was about to say."Why, Jane, what's the matter?""And positively a more
ungrateful set of people all around I never saw.You know I've never been able to do anything.And now I was so happy that I COULD do something, and I told
them so; and they seemed real pleased at first.I gave two dollars
apiece to the Ladies' Aid, the Home Missionary Society, and the Foreign
Missionary Society--and, do you know?They
acted for all the world as if they expected more--the grasping things!On the way home, just as I passed the Gale girls' I heard
Sue say: 'What's two dollars to her?"What's the good of giving, if you aren't going to get any credit, or
thanks, just because you're rich, I should like to know?"Look at Cousin Mary Davis--YOU know how poor they've
always been, and how hard it's been for them to get along.Her
Carrie--Mellicent's age, you know--has had to go to work in Hooper's
store.Well, I sent Mellicent's old white lace party dress to Mary.'Twas some soiled, of course, and a little torn; but I thought she
could clean it and make it over beautifully for Carrie.But, what do
you think?--back it came the next day with a note from Mary saying very
crisply that Carrie had no place to wear white lace dresses, and they
had no time to make it over if she did.Didn't I invite her to my housewarming?But how
are you going to help a person like that?""But, Jane, there must be ways--some ways."Miss Maggie's forehead was
wrinkled into a troubled frown.Davis has
been sick a long time, you remember.""Yes, I know he has; and that's all the more reason, to my way of
thinking, why they should be grateful for anything--ANYTHING!The
trouble is, she wants to be helped in ways of her own choosing.They
wanted Frank to take Sam, the boy,--he's eighteen now--into the store,
and they wanted me to get embroidery for Nellie to do at home--she's
lame, you know, but she does do beautiful work.Frank hates relatives in the store; he says they cause all
sorts of trouble with the other help; and I certainly wasn't going to
ask him to take any relatives of MINE.As for Nellie--I DID ask Hattie
if she couldn't give her some napkins to do, or something, and she gave
me a dozen for her--she said Nellie'd probably do them as cheap as
anybody, and maybe cheaper.But she told me not to go to the Gaylords
or the Pennocks, or any of that crowd, for she wouldn't have them know
for the world that we had a relative right here in town that had to
take in sewing.I told her they weren't her relations nor the
Blaisdells'; they were mine, and they were just as good as her folks
any day, and that it was no disgrace to be poor.Besides, she got mad then, and took back the
dozen napkins she'd given me.So I didn't have anything for poor
Nellie.Miss Maggie's lips shut in a thin straight line."Besides, if I'd taken
them to her, they wouldn't have appreciated it, I know.Why, last November, when the money came, I sent
them nearly all of Mellicent's and my old summer things--and if little
Tottie didn't go and say afterwards that her mamma did wish Cousin Jane
wouldn't send muslins in December when they hadn't room enough to store
a safety pin.Oh, of course, Mary didn't say that to ME, but she must
have said it somewhere, else Tottie wouldn't have got hold of it.'Children and fools,' you know," she finished meaningly, as she rose to
go.Smith noticed that Miss Maggie seemed troubled that evening, and he
knew that she started off early the next morning and was gone nearly
all day, coming home only for a hurried luncheon.It being Saturday,
the Martin girls were both there to care for Father Duff and the house.Smith suspect that he had learned the
reason for all this.Then a thin-faced young girl with tired eyes came
to tea one evening and was introduced to him as Miss Carrie Davis.Later, when Miss Maggie had gone upstairs to put Father Duff to bed,
Mr.Smith heard Carrie Davis telling Annabelle Martin all about how
kind Miss Maggie had been to Nellie, finding her all that embroidery to
do for that rich Mrs.Gaylord, and how wonderful it was that she had
been able to get such a splendid job for Sam right in Hooper's store
where she was.Smith thought he understood then Miss Maggie's long absence on
Saturday.Smith was often running across little kindnesses that Miss Maggie
had done.He began to think that Miss Maggie must be a very charitable
person--until he ran across several cases that she had not helped.Then
he did not know exactly what to think.His first experience of this kind was when he met an unmistakably
"down-and-out" on the street one day, begging clothing, food, anything,
and telling a sorry tale of his unjust discharge from a local factory.Smith gave the man a dollar, and sent him to Miss Maggie.He
happened to know that Father Duff had discarded an old suit that
morning--and Father Duff and the beggar might have been taken for twins
as to size.On the way home a little later he met the beggar returning,
just as forlorn, and even more hungry-looking."Well, my good fellow, couldn't she fix you up?"She
didn't fix me up ter nothin'--but chin music!"A few days later he heard an eager-eyed young woman begging Miss Maggie
for a contribution to the Pension Fund Fair in behalf of the underpaid
shopgirls in Daly's.Daly's was a Hillerton department Store, notorious
for its unfair treatment of its employees.Miss Maggie seemed interested, and asked many questions.The eager-eyed
young woman became even more eager-eyed, and told Miss Maggie all about
the long hours, the nerve-wearing labor, the low wages--wages upon
which it was impossible for any girl to live decently--wages whose
meagerness sent many a girl to her ruin.Miss Maggie listened attentively, and said, "Yes, yes, I see," several
times.But in the end the eager-eyed young woman went away empty-handed
and sad-eyed.He had thought Miss Maggie was so kind-hearted!She gave to some
fairs--why not to this one?Smith hunted up the
eager-eyed young woman and gave her ten dollars.He would have given
her more, but he had learned from unpleasant experience that large
gifts from unpretentious Mr.John Smith brought comments and curiosity
not always agreeable.It was not until many weeks later that Mr.Smith chanced to hear of the
complete change of policy of Daly's department store.Hours were
shortened, labor lightened, and wages raised.Incidentally he learned
that it had all started from a crusade of women's clubs and church
committees who had "got after old Daly" and threatened all sorts of
publicity and unpleasantness if the wrongs were not righted at once.He
learned also that the leader in the forefront of this movement had
been--Maggie Duff.As it chanced, it was on that same day that a strange man accosted him
on the street."Say, she was all right, she was, old man.I been hopin' I'd see ye
some day ter tell ye.""Ye don't know me, do ye?Well, I do look diff'rent, I'll own.Ye give
me a dollar once, an' sent me to a lady down the street thar.I thought 'twas only
chin-music she was givin' me.She hunted up the
wife an' kids, an' what's more, she went an' faced my boss, an' she got
me my job back, too."Why, I'm--I'm glad, of course!"CHAPTER XV

IN SEARCH OF REST


June brought all the young people home again.It brought, also, a great
deal of talk concerning plans for vacation.Bessie--Elizabeth--said
they must all go away.From James Blaisdell this brought a sudden and vigorous remonstrance."Nonsense, you've just got home!""Hillerton'll be a
vacation to you all right.I
haven't seen a thing of my children for six months."(Elizabeth had learned to give very
silvery laughs.)She shrugged her shoulders daintily and looked at her
rings.You wouldn't really doom us to Hillerton all summer,
daddy.""What isn't the matter with Hillerton?""But I thought we--we would have lovely auto trips," stammered her
mother apologetically."Take them from here, you know, and stay
overnight at hotels around.I've always wanted to do that; and we can
now, dear.""Why, mumsey, we're going to
the shore for July, and to the mountains for August.You and daddy and
I. And Fred's going, too, only he'll be at the Gaylord camp in the
Adirondacks, part of the time."James Blaisdell's eyes, fixed on his son, were
half wistful, half accusing."Well, I sort of had to, governor," he apologized.There are some things a man has to do!Gaylord asked me, and--Hang it
all, I don't see why you have to look at me as if I were committing a
crime, dad!""You aren't, dear, you aren't," fluttered Fred's mother hurriedly; "and
I'm sure it's lovely you've got the chance to go to the Gaylords' camp.And it's right, quite right, that we should travel this summer, as
Bessie--er--Elizabeth suggests.I never thought; but, of course, you
young people don't want to be hived up in Hillerton all summer!""Bet your life we don't, mater," shrugged Fred, carefully avoiding his
father's eyes, "after all that grind."But Fred had turned away, and did not, apparently, hear his father's
grieved question.Smith learned all about the vacation plans a day or two later from
Benny."Yep, we're all goin' away for all summer," he repeated, after he had
told the destination of most of the family."I don't think ma wants to,
much, but she's goin' on account of Bess.Besides, she says everybody
who is anybody always goes away on vacations, of course.They're goin' to the beach first, and I'm goin' to a boys' camp up
in Vermont--Mellicent, she's goin' to a girls' camp."She tried to get Bess to go--Gussie
Pennock's goin'.But Bess!--my you should see her nose go up in the
air!She said she wa'n't goin' where she had to wear great coarse shoes
an' horrid middy-blouses all day, an' build fires an' walk miles an'
eat bugs an' grasshoppers.""Is Miss Mellicent going to do all that?""Bess says she is--I mean, ELIZABETH.We have to call her
that now, when we don't forget it.Have you seen
her since she came back?""She's swingin' an awful lot of style--Bess is.She makes dad dress up
in his swallow-tail every night for dinner.An' she makes him and Fred
an' me stand up the minute she comes into the room, no matter if
there's forty other chairs in sight; an' we have to STAY standin' till
she sits down--an' sometimes she stands up a-purpose, just to keep US
standing.She says a gentleman never sits when a lady
is standin' up in his presence.An' she's lecturin' us all the time on
the way to eat an' talk an' act.Why, we can't even walk natural any
longer.An' she says the way Katy serves our meals is a disgrace to any
civilized family."She got mad an' gave notice on the spot.An' that made ma
'most have hysterics--she did have one of her headaches--'cause good
hired girls are awful scarce, she says.we'll get
some from the city next time that know their business, an' we're goin'
away all summer, anyway, an' won't ma please call them'maids,' as she
ought to, an' not that plebeian 'hired girl.'Everything's 'plebeian' with Bess now.Oh we're havin' great times at
our house since Bess--ELIZABETH--came!"grinned Benny, tossing his cap
in the air, and dancing down the walk much as he had danced the first
night Mr.The James Blaisdells were hardly off to shore and camp when Miss Flora
started on her travels.Smith learned all about her plans, too, for
she came down one day to talk them over with Miss Maggie.Miss Flora was looking very well in a soft gray and white summer silk.Her forehead had lost its lines of care, and her eyes were no longer
peering for wrinkles.panted Miss Flora, as she fluttered up the steps and sank into
one of the porch chairs.Smith was putting
up a trellis for Miss Maggie's new rosebush.He was working faithfully,
but not with the skill of accustomedness.Miss Flora settled back into her chair and
smoothed out the ruffles across her lap."It isn't too gay, is it?You
know the six months are more than up now.""I hoped it wasn't," sighed Miss Flora happily."Well, I'm all packed
but my dresses.""Why, I thought you weren't going till Monday," said Miss Maggie.I suppose I am a little ahead of time.But you see, I
ain't used to packing--not a big trunk, so--and I was so afraid I
wouldn't get it done in time.I was going to put my dresses in; but
Mis' Moore said they'd wrinkle awfully, if I did, and, of course, they
would, when you come to think of it.So I shan't put those in till
Sunday night.I'm so glad Mis' Moore's going.It'll be so nice to have
somebody along that I know.""And she knows everything--all about tickets and checking the baggage,
and all that.You know we're only going to be personally conducted to
Niagara.After that we're going to New York and stay two weeks at some
nice hotel.I want to see Grant's Tomb and the Aquarium, and Mis' Moore
wants to go to Coney Island.She says she's always wanted to go to
Coney Island just as I have to Niagara.""I'm glad you can take her," said Miss Maggie heartily.You know, even if she has such a nice
family, and all, she hasn't much money, and she's been awful nice to me
lately.I used to think she didn't like me, too.But I must have been
mistaken, of course.And 'twas so with Mis' Benson and Mis' Pennock,
too.But now they've invited me there and have come to see me, and are
SO interested in my trip and all.Why, I never knew I had so many
friends, Maggie.Miss Maggie said nothing, but, there was an odd expression on her face.Smith pounded a small nail home with an extra blow of his hammer."And they're all so kind and interested about the money, too," went on
Miss Flora, gently rocking to and fro."Bert Benson sells stocks and
invests money for folks, you know, and Mis' Benson said he'd got some
splendid-payin' ones, and he'd let me have some, and--"

"Flo, you DIDN'T take any of that Benson gold-mine stock!"Smith's hammer stopped, suspended in mid-air.Miss Maggie relaxed in her chair, and Mr.Smith's hammer fell with a
gentle tap on the nail-head."But I felt real bad about it--when Mis'
Benson had been so kind as to offer it, you know.It looked sort of--of
ungrateful, so."Miss Maggie's voice vibrated with indignant scorn."Flora, you won't--you WON'T invest your money without asking Mr.Chalmers's advice first, will you?""But I tell you I didn't," retorted Miss Flora, with unusual sharpness,
for her."But it was good stock, and it pays splendidly."Jane!--but I thought Frank wouldn't let her.""Oh, Frank said all right, if she wanted to, she might.I suspect he
got tired of her teasing, and it did pay splendidly.Why, 'twill pay
twenty-five per cent, probably, this year, Mis' Benson says.You see, he felt he'd got to pacify Jane some way, I s'pose,
she's so cut up about his selling out."Miss Flora
gave the satisfied little wriggle with which a born news-lover always
prefaces her choicest bit of information."Frank has sold his grocery
stores--both of 'em."Why, I should as soon think of his--his selling himself,"
cried Mr."Well, they ain't--because he's separated 'em."Miss Flora was rocking
a little faster now.That he's worked hard all his life, and it's
time he took some comfort.He says he doesn't take a minute of comfort
now 'cause Jane's hounding him all the time to get more money, to get
more money.She's crazy to see the interest mount up, you know--Jane
is.But he says he don't want any more money.He wants to SPEND money
for a while.He's going to retire from
business and enjoy himself."Smith, "this is a piece of news, indeed!""I should say it was," cried Miss Maggie, still almost incredulous."Oh, she's turribly fussed up over it, as you'd know she would be.Such
a good chance wasted, she thinks, when he might be making all that
money earn more.You know Jane wants to turn everything into money now.Honestly, Maggie, I don't believe Jane can look at the moon nowadays
without wishing it was really gold, and she had it to put out to
interest!""Well, it's so," maintained Miss Flora, "So 't ain't any wonder, of
course, that she's upset over this.That's why Frank give in to her, I
think, and let her buy that Benson stock.Besides, he's feeling
especially flush, because he's got the cash the stores brought, too."I'm sorry about that stock," frowned Miss Maggie.Mis' Benson said 'twas," comforted Miss
Flora."When
did this happen--the sale of the store, I mean?"She's ALWAYS hated it that Frank had a grocery store,
you know; and since the money's come, and she's been going with the
Gaylords and the Pennocks, and all that crowd, she's felt worse than
ever.She was saying to me only last week how ashamed she was to think
that her friends might see her own brother-in-law any day wearing
horrid white coat, and selling molasses over the counter.My, but
Hattie'll be tickled all right--or 'Harriet,' I suppose I should say,
but I never can remember it."But what is Frank going to--to do with himself?""Why, Flora, he'll be lost without that grocery store!""Oh, he's going to travel, first.He says he always wanted to, and he's
got a chance now, and he's going to.They're going to the Yellowstone
Park and the Garden of the Gods and to California.And that's another
thing that worries Jane--spending all that money for them just to ride
in the cars.""Oh, yes, she's going, too.She says she's got to go to keep Frank from
spending every cent he's got," laughed Miss Flora."I was over there
last night, and they told me all about it.""Just as soon as they can get ready.Frank's got to help Donovan, the
man that's bought the store, a week till he gets the run of things, he
says.Miss Flora got to
her feet, and smoothed out the folds of her skirt."He's as tickled as
a boy with a new jack-knife.Frank has been a turrible
hard worker all his life.I'm glad he's going to take some comfort,
same as I am."When Miss Flora had gone, Miss Maggie turned to Mr.Smith with eyes
that still carried dazed unbelief."DID Flora say that Frank Blaisdell had sold his grocery stores?"Jane, that he ought not to enjoy his
money, certainly?"He's got money enough to retire, if he wants to, and he's
certainly worked hard enough to earn a rest."But, to me, it's--just this: while he's
got plenty to retire UPON, he hasn't got anything to--to retire TO.""And, pray, what do you mean by that?"Smith, I've known that man from the time he was trading
jack-knives and marbles and selling paper boxes for five pins.I
remember the whipping he got, too, for filching sugar and coffee and
beans from the pantry and opening a grocery store in our barn.From
that time to this, that boy has always been trading SOMETHING.He's
been absolutely uninterested in anything else.I don't believe he's
read a book or a magazine since his school days, unless it had
something to do with business or groceries.He hasn't a sign of a
fad--music, photography, collecting things--nothing.Now, what I want to
know is, what is the man going to do?""Oh, he'll find something," laughed Mr."He's going to travel,
first, anyhow.""Yes, he's going to travel, first.And then--we'll see," smiled Miss
Maggie enigmatically, as Mr.By the middle of July the Blaisdells were all gone from Hillerton and there
remained only their letters for Miss Maggie--and for Mr.Miss
Maggie was very generous with her letters.Smith's
genuine interest, she read him extracts from almost every one that
came.And the letters were always interesting--and usually
characteristic.Benny wrote of swimming and tennis matches, and of "hikes" and the
"bully eats."Hattie wrote of balls and gowns and the attention "dear
Elizabeth" was receiving from some really very nice families who were
said to be fabulously rich.Neither James nor Bessie wrote at all.Mellicent wrote frequently--gay, breezy letters full to the brim of the
joy of living.She wrote of tennis, swimming, camp-fire stories, and
mountain trails: they were like Benny's letters in petticoats, Miss
Maggie said.Long and frequent epistles came from Miss Flora.Miss Flora was having
a beautiful time.Niagara was perfectly lovely--only what a terrible
noise it made!She was glad she did not have to stay and hear it
always.She liked New York, only that was noisy, too, though Mrs.Moore liked Coney Island, too, but Miss
Flora much preferred Grant's Tomb, she said.It was so much more quiet
and ladylike.She thought some things at Coney Island were really not
nice at all, and she was surprised that Mrs.Between the lines it could be seen that in spite of all the good times,
Miss Flora was becoming just the least bit homesick.She wrote Miss
Maggie that it did seem queer to go everywhere, and not see a soul to
bow to.It gave her such a lonesome feeling--such a lot of faces, and
not one familiar one!She had tried to make the acquaintance of several
people--real nice people; she knew they were by the way they looked.But they wouldn't say hardly anything to her, nor answer her questions;
and they always got up and moved away very soon.To be sure, there was one nice young man.He was lovely to them, Miss
Flora said.It was when they were down to
Coney Island.He helped them through the crowds, and told them about
lots of nice things they didn't want to miss seeing.He walked with
them, too, quite awhile, showing them the sights.He was very kind--he
seemed so especially kind, after all those other cold-hearted people,
who didn't care!Moore both lost their
pocketbooks, and had such an awful time getting back to New York.It
was right after they had said good-bye to the nice young gentleman that
they discovered that they had lost them.They were so sorry that they
hadn't found it out before, Miss Flora said, for he would have helped
them, she was sure.But though they looked everywhere for him, they
could not find him at all, and they had to appeal to strangers, who
took them right up to a policeman the first thing, which was very
embarrassing, Miss Flora said.Moore felt as if they
had been arrested, almost!Miss Maggie pursed her lips a little, when
she read this letter to Mr.From Jane, also, came several letters, and from Frank Blaisdell one
short scrawl.Frank said he was having a bully time, but that he'd seen some of the
most shiftless-looking grocery stores that he ever set eyes on.He
asked if Maggie knew how trade was at his old store, and if Donovan was
keeping it up to the mark.He said that Jane was well, only she was
getting pretty tired because she WOULD try to see everything at once,
for fear she'd lose something, and not get her money's worth, for all
the world just as she used to eat things to save them.Jane wrote that she was having a very nice time, of course,--she
couldn't help it, with all those lovely things to see; but she said she
never dreamed that just potatoes, meat, and vegetables could cost so
much anywhere as they did in hotels, and as for the prices those
dining-cars charged--it was robbery--sheer robbery!And why an
able-bodied man should be given ten cents every time he handed you your
own hat, she couldn't understand.Smith passed a very quiet summer, but a very
contented one.He kept enough work ahead to amuse him, but never enough
to drive him.He took frequent day-trips to the surrounding towns, and
when possible he persuaded Miss Maggie to go with him.Miss Maggie was
wonderfully good company.As the summer advanced, however, he did not
see so much of her as he wanted to, for Father Duff's increasing
infirmities made more and more demands on her time.Annabelle was learning the
milliner's trade, and Florence had taken a clerkship for afternoons
during the summer.They still helped about the work, and relieved Miss
Maggie whenever possible.They were sensible, jolly girls, and Mr.CHAPTER XVI

THE FLY IN THE OINTMENT


In August Father Duff died.James
Blaisdell was already in town.She wrote
that she could not think of coming down for the funeral, but she
ordered an expensive wreath.Frank and Jane were in the Far West, and
could not possibly have arrived in time, anyway.Smith helped in every way that he could help, and Miss Maggie told
him that he was a great comfort, and that she did not know what she
would have done without him.James Blaisdell helped,
too, in every way possible, and at last the first hard sad days were
over, and the household had settled back into something like normal
conditions again.Miss Maggie had more time now, and she went often to drive or for motor
rides with Mr.Together they explored cemeteries for miles
around; and although Miss Maggie worried sometimes because they found
so little Blaisdell data, Mr.Smith did not seem to mind it at all.In September Miss Flora moved into an attractive house on the West
Side, bought some new furniture, and installed a maid in the
kitchen--all under Miss Maggie's kindly supervision.In September, too,
Frank and Jane Blaisdell came home, and the young people began to
prepare for the coming school year.Hattie one day, coming out of Miss Maggie's gate.She smiled and greeted him cordially, but she looked so palpably upset
over something that he exclaimed to Miss Maggie, as soon he entered the
house: "What was it?Miss Maggie smiled--but she frowned, too."No, oh, no--except that Hattie has discovered that a hundred thousand
dollars isn't a million.""Oh, where she's been this summer she's measured up, of course, with
people a great deal richer than she.Here in
Hillerton her hundred--and two-hundred-dollar dresses looked very grand
to her, but she's discovered that there are women who pay five hundred
and a thousand, and even more.She feels very cheap and
poverty-stricken now, therefore, in her two-hundred-dollar gowns.If she only would stop trying to live like somebody else!""But I thought--I thought this money was making them happy," stammered
Mr."It was--until she realized that somebody else had more," sighed Miss
Maggie, with a shake of her head."Oh, well, she'll get over that.""At any rate, it's brought her husband some comfort.""Y-yes, it has; but--"

"What do you mean by that?"he demanded, when she did not finish her
sentence."I was wondering--if it would bring him any more.""Oh, no, but they've spent a lot--and Hattie is beginning again her old
talk that she MUST have more money in order to live 'even decent.'It
sounds very familiar to me, and to Jim, I suspect, poor fellow.I saw
him the other night, and from what he said, and what she says, I can
see pretty well how things are going.She's trying to get some of her
rich friends to give Jim a better position, where he'll earn more.She
doesn't understand, either, why Jim can't go into the stock market and
make millions, as some men do.I'm afraid she isn't always--patient.She says there are Fred and Elizabeth and Benjamin to educate, and that
she's just got to have more money to tide them over till the rest of
the legacy comes.""Good Heavens, does that
woman think that--" Mr.Smith stopped with the air of one pulling
himself back from an abyss.It is funny--the way she takes that for
granted, isn't it?Still, there are grounds for it, of course."Do YOU think--she'll get more, then?"To my mind the whole thing was rather
extraordinary, anyway, that he should have given them anything--utter
strangers as they were.Still, as Hattie says, as long as he HAS
recognized their existence, why, he may again of course.Still, on the
other hand, he may have very reasonably argued that, having willed them
a hundred thousand apiece, that was quite enough, and he'd give the
rest somewhere else.""And he may come back alive from South America"

"He may.""But Hattie isn't counting on either of these contingencies, and she is
counting on the money," sighed Miss Maggie, sobering again."And
Jim,--poor Jim!--I'm afraid he's going to find it just as hard to keep
caught up now--as he used to."He stood looking
out of the window, apparently in deep thought.Miss Maggie, with another sigh, turned and went out into the kitchen.The next day, on the street, Mr.She was
with a tall, manly-looking, square-jawed young fellow whom Mr.Mellicent smiled and blushed adorably.Then, to
his surprise, she stopped him with a gesture.Smith, I know it's on the street, but I--I want Mr.Gray to meet
you, and I want you to meet Mr.Smith is--is a very good
friend of mine, Donald."Smith greeted Donald Gray with a warm handshake and a keen glance
into his face.The blush, the hesitation, the shy happiness in
Mellicent's eyes had been unmistakable.Smith felt suddenly that
Donald Gray was a man he very much wanted to know--a good deal about.Then he went home and straight to Miss
Maggie."Well, to begin with, he's devoted to Mellicent.""You don't have to tell me that."What I want to know is, who is he?""He's a young man whom Mellicent met this summer.He plays the violin,
and Mellicent played his accompaniments in a church entertainment.He's the son of a minister near their
camp, where the girls went to church.He's
hard hit--that's sure.He came to Hillerton at once, and has gone to
work in Hammond's real estate office."Yes, I did--but her mother doesn't."She says he's worse than Carl Pennock--that he hasn't got
any money, not ANY money.""You don't mean
that she's really letting money stand in the way if Mellicent cares for
him?Why, it was only a year ago that she herself was bitterly
censuring Mrs.Pennock for doing exactly the same thing in the case of
young Pennock and Mellicent.""But--she seems to have forgotten that.""Shoe's on the other foot this time.""I don't think Jane has done much yet, by way of opposition.You see
they've only reached home, and she's just found out about it.But she
told me she shouldn't let it go on, not for a moment.She has other
plans for Mellicent.""Shall I be--meddling in what isn't my business, if I ask what they
are?""You know I am very much
interested in--Miss Mellicent."Perhaps you can suggest--a way out
for us," sighed Miss Maggie."The case is just this: Jane wants
Mellicent to marry Hibbard Gaylord."I've seen young Gray only once, but I'd give more for his
little finger than I would for a cartload of Gaylords!""But Jane--well, Jane feels
otherwise.To begin with, she's very much flattered at Gaylord's
attentions to Mellicent--the more so because he's left Bessie--I beg
her pardon, 'Elizabeth'--for her.""Then Miss Elizabeth is in it, too?"That's one of the reasons why Hattie is so anxious
for more money.She wants clothes and jewels for Bessie so she can keep
pace with the Gaylords.You see there's a wheel within a wheel here.""As near as I can judge, young Gaylord is Bessie's devoted slave--until
Mellicent arrives; then he has eyes only for HER, which piques Bessie
and her mother not a little.They were together more or less all summer
and I think Hattie thought the match was as good as made.Now, once in
Hillerton, back he flies to Mellicent."I think--no, I KNOW she cares for young
Gray; but--well, I might as well admit it, she is ready any time to
flirt outrageously with Hibbard Gaylord, or--or with anybody else, for
that matter.I saw her flirting with you at the party last Christmas!"Miss Maggie's face showed a sudden pink blush.If she'll flirt with young Gaylord AND
OTHERS, it's all right."But I don't like to have her flirt at all, Mr.It's just her bottled-up childhood and youth
bubbling over.She can't help bubbling, she's been repressed so long.She'll come out all right, and she won't come out hand in hand with
Hibbard Gaylord.She'll be quiet, but
she'll be firm.With one hand she'll keep Gray away, and with the other
she'll push Gaylord forward.Even Mellicent herself won't know how it's
done.But it'll be done, and I tremble for the consequences."Smith's eyes had lost their twinkle now.To himself he
muttered: "I wonder if maybe--I hadn't better take a hand in this thing
myself.""You said--I didn't understand what you said," murmured Miss Maggie
doubtfully."Nothing--nothing, Miss Maggie," replied the man.Then, with
business-like alertness, he lifted his chin."How long do you say this
has been going on?""Why, especially since they all came home two weeks ago.Jane knew
nothing of Donald Gray till then.""Oh, he comes in anywhere that he can find a chance; though, to do her
justice, Mellicent doesn't give him--many chances.""What does her father say to all this?"He says nothing--or, rather, he laughs, and says: 'Oh, well, it will
come out all right in time.He's taken him to ride in his car once, to my
knowledge."Frank Blaisdell has--a car?""Oh, yes, he's just been learning to run it.Jane says he's crazy over
it, and that he's teasing her to go all the time.She says he wants to
be on the move somewhere every minute."Well, no, I--didn't.""Oh yes, he's joined the Hillerton Country Club, and he goes up to the
links every morning for practice.""I can't imagine it--Frank Blaisdell spending his mornings playing
golf!""Frank Blaisdell is a retired
business man.He has begun to take some pleasure in life now."Smith, as he turned to go into his own room.Smith called on the Frank Blaisdells that evening.Blaisdell
took him out to the garage (very lately a barn), and showed him the
shining new car.He also showed him his lavish supply of golf clubs,
and told him what a "bully time" he was having these days.He told him,
too, all about his Western trip, and said there was nothing like travel
to broaden a man's outlook.He said a great deal about how glad he was
to get out of the old grind behind the counter--but in the next breath
he asked Mr.Smith if he had ever seen a store run down as his had done
since he left it.Donovan didn't know any more than a cat how such a
store should be run, he said.When they came back from the garage they found callers in the
living-room.Carl Pennock and Hibbard Gaylord were chatting with
Mellicent.Almost at once the doorbell rang, too, and Donald Gray came
in with his violin and a roll of music.Mellicent's mother came in
also.She greeted all the young men pleasantly, and asked Carl Pennock
to tell Mr.Then she sat down by
young Gray and asked him many questions about his music.She was SO
interested in violins, she said.Gray waxed eloquent, and seemed wonderfully pleased--for about five
minutes; then Mr.Smith saw that his glance was shifting more and more
frequently and more and more unhappily to Mellicent and Hibbard
Gaylord, talking tennis across the room.Smith apparently lost interest in young Pennock's fish story then.At all events, another minute found him eagerly echoing Mrs.Blaisdell's interest in violins--but with this difference: violins in
the abstract with her became A violin in the concrete with him; and he
must hear it at once.Jane herself could not have told exactly how it was done, but she
knew that two minutes later young Gray and Mellicent were at the piano,
he, shining-eyed and happy, drawing a tentative bow across the strings:
she, no less shining-eyed and happy, giving him "A" on the piano.Smith enjoyed the music very much--so much that he begged for
another selection and yet another.Smith did not appear to realize
that Messrs.Pennock and Gaylord were passing through sham interest and
frank boredom to disgusted silence.Jane's efforts to substitute some other form of entertainment for the
violin-playing.He shook hands very heartily, however, with Pennock and
Gaylord when they took their somewhat haughty departure, a little
later, and, strange to say, his interest in the music seemed to go with
their going; for at once then he turned to Mr.Frank Blaisdell
with a very animated account of some Blaisdell data he had found only
the week before.He did not appear to notice that the music of the piano had become
nothing but soft fitful snatches with a great deal of low talk and
laughter between.Blaisdell, and
especially Mrs.Blaisdell, should know the intimate history of one
Ephraim Blaisdell, born in 1720, and his ten children and forty-nine
grandchildren.He talked of various investments then, and of the
weather.He talked of the Blaisdells' trip, and of the cost of railroad
fares and hotel life.Jane told her husband
after he left that Mr.Smith had talked of everything under the sun,
and that she nearly had a fit because she could not get one minute to
herself to break in upon Mellicent and that horrid Gray fellow at the
piano.She had
never remembered he was such a talker!The young people had a tennis match on the school tennis court the next
day.Smith told Miss Maggie that he thought he would drop around
there.He said he liked very much to watch tennis games.Miss Maggie said yes, that she liked to watch tennis games, too.If
this was just a wee bit of a hint, it quite failed of its purpose, for
Mr.Smith did not offer to take her with him.He changed the subject,
indeed, so abruptly, that Miss Maggie bit her lip and flushed a little,
throwing a swift glance into his apparently serene countenance.Miss Maggie herself, in the afternoon, with an errand for an excuse,
walked slowly by the tennis court.Smith at once--but he
did not seem at all interested in the playing.He had his back to the
court, in fact.He was talking very animatedly with Mellicent
Blaisdell.He was still talking with her--though on the opposite side
of the court--when Miss Maggie went by again on her way home.Miss Maggie frowned and said something just under her breath about
"that child--flirting as usual!"Then she went on, walking very fast,
and without another glance toward the tennis ground.But a little
farther on Miss Maggie's step lagged perceptibly, and her head lost its
proud poise.Miss Maggie, for a reason she could not have explained
herself, was feeling suddenly old, and weary, and very much alone.To the image in the mirror as she took off her hat a few minutes later
in her own hall, she said scornfully:

"Well, why shouldn't you feel old?Miss
Maggie had a habit of talking to herself in the mirror--but never
before had she said anything like this to herself.queried Miss Maggie, without looking up
from the stocking she was mending.Why, I don't remember who did win finally," he answered.Nor did it apparently occur to him that for one who was so greatly
interested in tennis, he was curiously uninformed.Smith left the house soon after breakfast, and,
contrary to his usual custom, did not mention where he was going.Miss
Maggie was surprised and displeased.More especially was she displeased
because she WAS displeased.As if it mattered to her where he went, she
told herself scornfully.The next day and the next it was much the same.demanded Jane, without preamble, glancing at the
vacant chair by the table in the corner.Miss Maggie, to her disgust, could feel the color burning in her
cheeks; but she managed to smile as if amused."I don't know, I'm sure."Well, if you were I should ask you to keep him away from Mellicent,"
retorted Mrs."I mean he's been hanging around Mellicent almost every day for a week."Smith is fifty if
he's a day.""I'm not saying he isn't," sniffed Jane, her nose uptilted."But I do
say, 'No fool like an old fool'!"Smith has always been fond
of Mellicent, and--and interested in her.But I don't believe he cares
for her--that way.""Then why does he come to see her and take her auto-riding, and hang
around her every minute he gets a chance?""I know how he
acts at the house, and I hear he scarcely left her side at the tennis
match the other day.""Yes, I--" Miss Maggie did not finish her sentence.A slow change came
to her countenance.The flush receded, leaving her face a bit white."I wonder if the man really thinks he stands any chance," spluttered
Jane, ignoring Miss Maggie's unfinished sentence."Why, he's worse than
that Donald Gray.He not only hasn't got the money, but he's old, as
well.""Yes, we're all--getting old, Jane."Miss Maggie tossed the words off
lightly, and smiled as she uttered them.Jane had gone,
she went to the little mirror above the mantel and gazed at herself
long and fixedly.Then resolutely she turned away, picked up her work,
and fell to sewing very fast.Two days later Mellicent went back to school.To Miss Maggie things seemed to settle back
into their old ways again then.Smith she took drives and
motor-rides, enjoying the crisp October air and the dancing sunlight on
the reds and browns and yellows of the autumnal foliage.True, she used
to wonder sometimes if the end always justified the means--it seemed an
expensive business to hire an automobile to take them fifty miles and
back, and all to verify a single date.And she could not help noticing
that Mr.Smith appeared to have many dates that needed verifying--dates
that were located in very diverse parts of the surrounding country.Miss Maggie also could not help noticing that Mr.Smith was getting
very little new material for his Blaisdell book these days, though he
still worked industriously over the old, retabulating, and recopying.She knew this, because she helped him do it--though she was careful to
let him know that she recognized the names and dates as old
acquaintances.To tell the truth, Miss Maggie did not like to admit, even to herself,
that Mr.Smith must be nearing the end of his task.She did not like to
think of the house--after Mr.She told herself
that he was just the sort of homey boarder that she liked, and she
wished she might keep him indefinitely.She thought so all the more when the long evenings of November brought
a new pleasure; Mr.Smith fell into the way of bringing home books to
read aloud; and she enjoyed that very much.They had long talks, too,
over the books they read.In one there was an old man who fell in love
with a young girl, and married her.Miss Maggie, as certain parts of
this story were read, held her breath, and stole furtive glances into
Mr.When it was finished she contrived to question with
careful casualness, as to his opinion of such a marriage.He said he did not
believe that such a marriage should take place, nor did he believe that
in real life, it would result in happiness.Marriage should be between
persons of similar age, tastes, and habits, he said very decidedly.And
Miss Maggie blushed and said yes, yes, indeed!And that night, when
Miss Maggie gazed at herself in the glass, she looked so happy--that
she appeared to be almost as young as Mellicent herself!CHAPTER XVII

AN AMBASSADOR OF CUPID'S


Christmas again brought all the young people home for the holidays.It
brought, also, a Christmas party at James Blaisdell's home.It was a
very different party, however, from the housewarming of a year before.To begin with, the attendance was much smaller; Mrs.Hattie had been
very exclusive in her invitations this time.She had not invited
"everybody who ever went anywhere."There were champagne, and
cigarettes for the ladies, too.Miss Maggie, who
had not attended any social gathering since Father Duff died, yielded
to Mr.Smith's urgings and said that she would go to this.But Miss
Maggie wished afterward that she had not gone--there were so many, many
features about that party that Miss Maggie did not like.She did not like the champagne nor the cigarettes.She did not like
Bessie's showy, low-cut dress, nor her supercilious airs.She did not
like the look in Fred's eyes, nor the way he drank the champagne.She
did not like Jane's maneuvers to bring Mellicent and Hibbard Gaylord
into each other's company--nor the way Mr.Smith maneuvered to get
Mellicent for himself.Of all these, except the very last, Miss Maggie talked with Mr.Smith
on the way home--yet it was the very last that was uppermost in her
mind, except perhaps, Fred.She did speak of Fred; but because that,
too, was so much to her, she waited until the last before she spoke of
it."You saw Fred, of course," she began then.Short as the word was, it carried a volume of meaning to Miss
Maggie's fearful ears.Smith, it--it isn't true, is it?""You saw him--drinking, then?"I saw some, and I heard--more.He's got in
with Gaylord and the rest of his set at college, and they're a bad
lot--drinking, gambling--no good.""But Fred wouldn't--gamble, Mr.And
he's so ambitious to get ahead!Surely he'd know he couldn't get
anywhere in his studies, if--if he drank and gambled!"I saw him only a minute at the first, and he
didn't look well a bit, to me."I found him in his den just as I did last year.He
didn't look well to me, either.""Not a word--and that's what worries me the most.Last year he talked a
lot about him, and was so proud and happy in his coming success.This
time he never mentioned him; but he looked--bad.""Oh, books, business:--nothing in particular.And he wasn't interested
in what he did say."He's talked with me
quite a lot about--about the way they're living.He doesn't like--so
much fuss and show and society."Hattie would get over all that by this time, after
the newness of the money was worn off."It's worse, if anything," sighed
Miss Maggie, as they ascended the steps at her own door."And Miss Bessie--" he began disapprovingly, then stopped."Now, Miss
Mellicent--" he resumed, in a very different voice.With a rather loud
rattling of the doorknob she was pushing open the door.she cried, hurrying
into the living-room.Smith, hurrying after, evidently forgot to finish his sentence.Miss Maggie did not attend any more of the merrymakings of that holiday
week.It seemed to Miss Maggie, indeed, that Mr.Smith was away nearly every minute of that long week--and it WAS a long
week to Miss Maggie.Even the Martin girls were away many of the
evenings.Miss Maggie told herself that that was why the house seemed
so lonesome.But though Miss Maggie did not participate in the gay doings, she heard
of them.She heard of them on all sides, except from Mr.Smith--and on
all sides she heard of the devotion of Mr.She
concluded that this was the reason why Mr.Smith understood that Mellicent and young
Gray cared for each other, and she had thought that Mr.Smith even
approved of the affair between them.Now to push himself on the scene
in this absurd fashion and try "to cut everybody out," as it was
vulgarly termed--she never would have believed it of Mr.She had considered him to be a man of good sense and good judgment.And
had he not himself said, not so long ago, that he believed lovers
should be of the same age, tastes, and habits?And yet, here now he
was--

And there could be no mistake about it.The Martin girls brought it home as current gossip.Jane was
highly exercised over it, and even Harriet had exclaimed over the
"shameful flirtation Mellicent was carrying on with that man old enough
to be her father!"Besides, did she not see
with her own eyes that Mr.Smith was gone every day and evening, and
that, when he was at home at meal-time, he was silent and preoccupied,
and not like himself at all?And it was such a pity--she had thought so much of Mr.And Miss Maggie looked ill on the last evening of that holiday week
when, at nine o'clock, Mr.Smith found her sitting idle-handed before
the stove in the living-room."Why, Miss Maggie, what's the matter with you?"cried the man, in very
evident concern."You don't look like yourself to-night!"I'm just--tired, I guess.In spite of herself Miss Maggie's voice carried a
tinge of something not quite pleasant.Smith, however, did not appear to notice it."Yes, I'm home early for once, thank Heaven!"he half groaned, as he
dropped himself into a chair."It has been a strenuous week for you, hasn't it?"Again the tinge of
something not quite pleasant in Miss Maggie's voice."Yes, but it's been worth it."There was a
vague questioning in his eyes.Obtaining, apparently, however, no
satisfactory answer from Miss Maggie's placid countenance, he turned
away and began speaking again."Well, anyway, I've accomplished what I set out to do.""You-you've ALREADY accomplished it?"She was
gazing at him now with startled, half-frightened eyes.Why, Miss Maggie, what's the matter?What makes you look so--so
queer?"Why, nothing--nothing at all," laughed Miss Maggie
nervously, but very gayly."I may have been a little--surprised, for a
moment; but I'm very glad--very.""Why, yes, for--for you.Isn't one always glad when--when a love affair
is--is all settled?"Smith smiled pleasantly, but without
embarrassment."It doesn't matter, of course, only--well, I had hoped
it wasn't too conspicuous.""Oh, but you couldn't expect to hide a thing like that, Mr.Smith,"
retorted Miss Maggie, with what was very evidently intended for an arch
smile."Well, I suppose I couldn't expect to keep a thing like that entirely
in the dark.Still, I don't believe the parties themselves--quite
understood.Of course, Pennock and Gaylord knew that they were kept
effectually away, but I don't believe they realized just how
systematically it was done.I--I can't help being sorry for him.""Certainly; and I should think YOU might give him a little sympathy,"
rejoined Miss Maggie spiritedly."You KNOW how much he cared for
Mellicent."Why, what in the world are you talking about?Wasn't I doing the best I could for them all the time?Of COURSE, it
kept HIM away from her, too, just as it did Pennock and Gaylord; but HE
understood.Besides, he HAD her part of the time.I let him in whenever
it was possible.""Whatever in the world
are YOU talking about?Do you mean to say you were doing this FOR Mr.You didn't suppose it
was for Pennock or Gaylord, did you?Nor for--" He stopped short and
stared at Miss Maggie in growing amazement and dismay."You didn't--you
DIDN'T think--I was doing that--for MYSELF?""Well, of course, I--I--" Miss Maggie was laughing and blushing
painfully, but there was a new light in her eyes."Well, anyway,
everybody said you were!"Smith leaped to his feet and thrust his hands
into his pockets, as he took a nervous turn about the room.as if, in my position, I'd--How perfectly absurd!"He
wheeled and faced her irritably.Why, I'm not a
marrying man.I don't like--I never saw the woman yet that I--" With
his eyes on Miss Maggie's flushed, half-averted face, he stopped again
abruptly."Well, I'll be--" Even under his breath he did not finish his
sentence; but, with a new, quite different expression on his face, he
resumed his nervous pacing of the room, throwing now and then a quick
glance at Miss Maggie's still averted face."It WAS absurd, of course, wasn't it?"Miss Maggie stirred and spoke
lightly, with the obvious intention of putting matters back into usual
conditions again."But, come, tell me, just what did you do, and how?I'm so interested--indeed, I am!"Smith spoke as if he was thinking of something else
entirely.Smith sat down, but he did not go on speaking
at once."You said--you kept Pennock and Gaylord away," Miss Maggie hopefully
reminded him.Oh, I--it was really very simple--I just monopolized
Mellicent myself, when I couldn't let Donald have her.I
saw very soon that she couldn't cope with her mother alone.And
Gaylord--well, I've no use for that young gentleman."I've been looking him up for some time.Miss Maggie asked other questions--Miss Maggie was manifestly
interested--and Mr.Very soon he said good-night and went to his own room.Miss Maggie, who still felt
self-conscious and embarrassed over her misconception of his attentions
to Mellicent, was more talkative than usual in her nervous attempt to
appear perfectly natural.The fact that she often found his eyes fixed
thoughtfully upon her, and felt them following her as she moved about
the room, did not tend to make her more at ease.At such times she
talked faster than ever--usually, if possible, about some member of the
Blaisdell family: Miss Maggie had learned that Mr.Smith was always
interested in any bit of news about the Blaisdells.It was on such an occasion that she told him about Miss Flora and the
new house."I don't know, really, what I am going to do with her," she said."I
wonder if perhaps you could help me.""Help you?--about Miss Flora?"Can you think of any way to make her contented?"Why, I thought--Don't tell me SHE isn't happy!"There was a
curious note of almost despair in Mr."Hasn't she a new
house, and everything nice to go with it?""Oh, yes--and that's what's the trouble.She feels
smothered and oppressed--as if she were visiting somewhere, and not at
home.You see, Miss Flora has always
lived very simply.She isn't used to maids--and the maid knows it,
which, if you ever employed maids, you would know is a terrible state
of affairs.""Oh, but she--she'll get used to that, in time.""Perhaps," conceded
Miss Maggie, "but I doubt it.Some women would, but not Miss Flora.She
is too inherently simple in her tastes.'Why, it's as bad as always
living in a hotel!''You know on my trip I
was so afraid always I'd do something that wasn't quite right, before
those awful waiters in the dining-rooms, and I was anticipating so much
getting home where I could act natural--and here I've got one in my own
house!'"She says Hattie is
always telling her what is due her position, and that she must do this
and do that.She's being invited out, too, to the Pennocks' and the
Bensons'; and they're worse than the maid, she declares.She says she
loves to 'run in' and see people, and she loves to go to places and
spend the day with her sewing; but that these things where you go and
stand up and eat off a jiggly plate, and see everybody, and not really
see ANYBODY, are a nuisance and an abomination.""Well, she's about right there," chuckled Mr."Yes, I think she is," smiled Miss Maggie; "but that isn't telling me
how to make her contented."Smith, with an irritability that
was as sudden as it was apparently causeless."I didn't suppose you had
to tell any woman on this earth how to be contented--with a hundred
thousand dollars!""It would seem so, wouldn't it?"Smith's eyes to her face in a
keen glance of interrogation."You mean--you'd like the chance to prove it?That you wish YOU had
that hundred thousand?""Oh, I didn't say--that," twinkled Miss Maggie mischievously, turning
away.Jane Blaisdell on
the street."You're just the man I want to see," she accosted him eagerly."Then I'll turn and walk along with you, if I may," smiled Mr."Well, I don't know as you can do anything," she sighed; "but
somebody's got to do something.Could you--DO you suppose you could
interest my husband in this Blaisdell business of yours?"Smith gave a start, looking curiously disconcerted."Why, I--I thought he
was--er--interested in motoring and golf.""Oh, he was, for a time; but it's too cold for those now, and he got
sick of them, anyway, before it did come cold, just as he does of
everything.Well, yesterday he asked a question--something about Father
Blaisdell's mother; and that gave me the idea.DO you suppose you could
get him interested in this ancestor business?It's so nice and quiet, and it CAN'T cost much--not like golf clubs and
caddies and gasoline, anyway."Why, I--I don't know, Mrs."I--I could show him what I have found, of course.""Well, I wish you would, then.Anyway, SOMETHING'S got to be done," she
sighed.And he
isn't a bit well, either.He ate such a lot of rich food and all sorts
of stuff on our trip that he got his stomach all out of order; and now
he can't eat anything, hardly."Well, if his stomach's knocked out I pity him," nodded Mr.You did say so when you first came,
didn't you?Smith PLEASE, if you know any of those health
fads, don't tell them to my husband.He's tried
dozens of them until I'm nearly wild, and I've lost two hired girls
already.One day it'll be no water, and the next it'll be all he can
drink; and one week he won't eat anything but vegetables, and the next
he won't touch a thing but meat and--is it fruit that goes with meat or
cereals?And lately
he's taken to inspecting every bit of meat and groceries that comes
into the house.Why, he spends half his time in the kitchen, nosing
'round the cupboards and refrigerator; and, of course, NO girl will
stand that!That's why I'm hoping, oh, I AM hoping that you can do
SOMETHING with him on that ancestor business.There, here is the
Bensons', where I've got to stop--and thank you ever so much, Mr."All right, I'll try," promised Mr.Smith dubiously, as he lifted his
hat.But he frowned, and he was still frowning when he met Miss Maggie
at the Duff supper-table half an hour later."Well, I've found another one who wants me to tell how to be contented,
though afflicted with a hundred thousand dollars," he greeted her
gloweringly."Yes.--CAN'T a hundred thousand dollars bring any one satisfaction?"Miss Maggie laughed, then into her eyes came the mischievous twinkle
that Mr."Don't blame the poor money," she said then demurely."Blame--the way
it is spent!"CHAPTER XVIII

JUST A MATTER OF BEGGING


True to his promise, Mr.Frank Blaisdell on "the
ancestor business" very soon.Laboriously he got out his tabulated
dates and names and carefully he traced for him several lines of
descent from remote ancestors.Painstakingly he pointed out a "Submit,"
who had no history but the bare fact of her marriage to one Thomas
Blaisdell, and a "Thankful Marsh," who had eluded his every attempt to
supply her with parents.He let it be understood how important these
missing links were, and he tried to inspire his possible pupil with a
frenzied desire to go out and dig them up.He showed some of the
interesting letters he had received from various Blaisdells far and
near, and he spread before him the genealogical page of his latest
"Transcript," and explained how one might there stumble upon the very
missing link he was looking for.He said he didn't care how
many children his great-grandfather had, nor what they died of; and as
for Mrs.Submit and Miss Thankful, the ladies might bury themselves in
the "Transcript," or hide behind that wall of dates and names till
doomsday, for all he cared.He never did like
figures, he said, except figures that represented something worth
while, like a day's sales or a year's profits.Smith ever seen a store run
down as his old one had since he sold out?For that matter, something
must have got into all the grocery stores; for a poorer lot of goods
than those delivered every day at his home he never saw.It was a
disgrace to the trade.He said a good deal more about his grocery store--but nothing whatever
more about his Blaisdell ancestors; so Mr.Smith felt justified in
considering his efforts to interest Mr.Frank Blaisdell in the ancestor
business a failure.It was in February that a certain metropolitan reporter, short for
feature articles, ran up to Hillerton and contributed to his paper, the
following Sunday, a write-up on "The Blaisdells One Year After,"
enlarging on the fine new homes, the motor cars, and the luxurious
living of the three families.And it was three days after this article
was printed that Miss Flora appeared at Miss Maggie's, breathless with
excitement."Just see what I've got in the mail this morning!"she cried to Miss
Maggie, and to Mr.Smith, who had opened the door for her.With trembling fingers she took from her bag a letter, and a small
picture evidently cut from a newspaper."There, see," she panted, holding them out."It's a man in Boston, and
these are his children.He said he knew I must have a real kind heart, and
he's in terrible trouble.He said he saw in the paper about the
wonderful legacy I'd had, and he told his wife he was going to write to
me, to see if I wouldn't help them--if only a little, it would aid them
that much."Miss Maggie had taken the letter and the
picture rather gingerly in her hands.Smith had gone over to the
stove suddenly--to turn a damper, apparently, though a close observer
might have noticed that he turned it back to its former position almost
at once."He's sick, and he lost his position, and
his wife's sick, and two of the children, and one of 'em's lame, and
another's blind.Oh, it was such a pitiful story, Maggie!Why, some
days they haven't had enough to eat--and just look at me, with all my
chickens and turkeys and more pudding every day than I can stuff down!"He didn't ask me to HIRE him for
anything.""No, no, dear, but I mean--did he give you any references, to show that
he was--was worthy and all right," explained Miss Maggie patiently.He told me himself how
things were with him," rebuked Miss Flora indignantly."It's all in the
letter there."But he really ought to have given you SOME reference, dear, if he
asked you for money.""Well, I don't want any reference.I'd be ashamed to
doubt a man like that!And YOU would, after you read that letter, and
look into those blessed children's faces.Besides, he never thought of
such a thing--I know he didn't.Why, he says right in the letter there
that he never asked for help before, and he was so ashamed that he had
to now."[Illustration with caption: "AND LOOK INTO THOSE BLESSED CHILDREN'S
FACES"]

Mr.Smith made a sudden odd little noise in his throat.At all events, he was seized with a fit of coughing just then.Miss Maggie turned over the letter in her hand."Where does he tell you to send the money?""It's right there--Box four hundred and something; and I got a money
order, just as he said."Do you mean that you've already sent this money?"I stopped at the office on the way down here."He said he would rather have that than a check."You don't seem to have--delayed any."Why, Maggie, he said he HAD to have it at
once.He was going to be turned out--TURNED OUT into the streets!Think
of those seven little children in the streets!Why,
Maggie, what can you be thinking of?""I'm thinking you've been the easy victim of a professional beggar,
Flora," retorted Miss Maggie, with some spirit, handing back the letter
and the picture."Why, Maggie, I never knew you to be so--so unkind," charged Miss
Flora, her eyes tearful."He can't be a professional beggar.He SAID he
wasn't--that he never begged before in his life."Miss Maggie, with a despairing gesture, averted her face.Smith, you--YOU don't think so, do you?"Smith grew very red--perhaps because he had to stop to cough again."Well, Miss Flora, I--I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I shall have to agree
with Miss Maggie here, to some extent."You don't know how beautifully he
talked.""You told me; and you say yourself that he gave you only a post-office
box for an address.So you see you couldn't look him up very well."Miss Flora threw back her head a little haughtily."And I'm glad I don't doubt my fellow men and women as you and Maggie
Duff do!If either of you KNEW what you're talking about, I wouldn't
say anything.You CAN'T KNOW anything about this man,
and you didn't ever get letters like this, either of you, of course.But, anyhow, I don't care if he ain't worthy.I wouldn't let those
children suffer; and I--I'm glad I sent it.I never in my life was so
happy as I was on the way here from the post-office this morning."Without waiting for a reply, she turned away majestically; but at the
door she paused and looked back at Miss Maggie."And let me tell you that, however good or bad this particular man may
be, it's given me an idea, anyway," she choked.The haughtiness was all
gone now "I know now why it hasn't seemed right to be so happy.It's
because there are so many other folks in the world that AREN'T happy.Why, my chicken and turkey would choke me now if I didn't give some of
it to--to all these others.And I'm going to--I'M GOING TO!"she
reiterated, as she fled from the room.As the door shut crisply, Miss Maggie turned and looked at Mr.Smith had crossed again to the stove and was fussing with the
damper.Miss Maggie, after a moment's hesitation, turned and went out
into the kitchen, without speaking.Smith and Miss Maggie saw very little of Miss Flora after this for
some time.They heard of her
generous gifts to families all over town.A turkey was sent to every house on Mill Street, without exception, and
so much candy given to the children that half of them were made ill,
much to the distress of Miss Flora, who, it was said, promptly sent a
physician to undo her work.The Dow family, hard-working and thrifty,
and the Nolans, notorious for their laziness and shiftlessness, each
received a hundred dollars outright.The Whalens, always with both
hands metaphorically outstretched for alms, were loud in their praises
of Miss Flora's great kindness of heart; but the Davises (Mrs.Jane
Blaisdell's impecunious relatives) had very visible difficulty in
making Miss Flora understand that gifts bestowed as she bestowed them
were more welcome unmade.Every day, from one quarter or another, came stories like these to the
ears of Miss Maggie and Mr.Then one day, about a month later, she appeared as before at the Duff
cottage, breathless and agitated; only this time, plainly, she had been
crying."Why, Flora, what in the world is the matter?"cried Miss Maggie, as
she hurried her visitor into a comfortable chair and began to unfasten
her wraps.Oh, he ain't here, is he?"she lamented, with a
disappointed glance toward the vacant chair by the table in the corner."I thought maybe he could help me, some way.I won't go to Frank, or
Jim.They've--they've said so many things.I'll call him,"
comforted Miss Maggie, taking off Miss Flora's veil and hat and
smoothing back her hair."But you don't want him to find you crying
like this, Flora."Yes, yes, I know, but I'm not crying--I mean, I won't any more.And
I'll tell you just as soon as you get Mr.It's only that I've
been--so silly, I suppose.Miss Maggie, still with the disturbed frown between her eyebrows,
summoned Mr.Then together they sat down to hear Miss Flora's
story."It all started, of course, from--from that day I brought the letter
here--from that man in Boston with seven children, you know.""Yes, I remember," encouraged Miss Maggie."Well, I--I did quite a lot of things after that.I was so glad and
happy to discover I could do things for folks.It seemed to--to take
away the wickedness of my having so much, you know; and so I gave food
and money, oh, lots of places here in town--everywhere,'most, that I
could find that anybody needed it."We heard of the many kind things you did, dear."Miss
Maggie had the air of one trying to soothe a grieved child."But they didn't turn out to be kind--all of 'em," quavered Miss Flora.I TRIED to do 'em all right!""I know; but 'tain't those I came to talk about.I got 'em--lots of 'em--after the first one--the one you saw.First I got one, then another and another, till lately I've been
getting 'em every day,'most, and some days two or three at a time.""And they all wanted--money, I suppose," observed Mr.Smith, "for their
sick wives and children, I suppose.""Oh, not for children always--though it was them a good deal.But it
was for different things--and such a lot of them!I never knew there
could be so many kinds of such things.And I was real pleased, at
first,--that I could help, you know, in so many places.""Then you always sent it--the money?"Why, I just had to, the way they wrote; I wanted to, too.They wrote lovely letters, and real interesting ones, too.One man
wanted a warm coat for his little girl, and he told me all about what
hard times they'd had.Another wanted a brace for his poor little
crippled boy, and HE told me things.Why, I never s'posed folks could
have such awful things, and live!One woman just wanted to borrow
twenty dollars while she was so sick.She didn't ask me to give it to
her.Don't you suppose I'd send her that money?And there was a poor blind man--he wanted money to buy
a Bible in raised letters; and of COURSE I wouldn't refuse that!Some
didn't beg; they just wanted to sell things.I bought a diamond ring to
help put a boy through school, and a ruby pin of a man who needed the
money for bread for his children.And there was--oh, there was lots of
'em--too many to tell.""And all from Boston, I presume," murmured Mr."Oh, no,--why, yes, they were, too, most of 'em, when you come to think
of it."No, I haven't finished," moaned Miss Flora, almost crying again."And
now comes the worst of it.As I said, at first I liked it--all these
letters--and I was so glad to help.But they're coming so fast now I
don't know what to do with 'em.And I never saw such a lot of things as
they want--pensions and mortgages, and pianos, and educations, and
wedding dresses, and clothes to be buried in, and--and there were so
many, and--and so queer, some of 'em, that I began to be afraid maybe
they weren't quite honest, all of 'em, and of course I CAN'T send to
such a lot as there are now, anyway, and I was getting so worried.Besides, I got another one of those awful proposals from those dreadful
men that want to marry me.As if I didn't know THAT was for my money!Then to-day, this morning, I--I got the worst of all."From her bag she
took an envelope and drew out a small picture of several children, cut
apparently from a newspaper."Why, no,--yes, it's the one you brought us a month ago, isn't it?"The one I showed you before is in my bureau drawer
at home.But I got it out this morning, when this one came, and
compared them; and they're just exactly alike--EXACTLY!""Oh, he wrote again, then,--wants more money, I suppose," frowned Miss
Maggie.This man's name is Haley, and
that one was Fay.Haley says this is a picture of his children,
and he says that the little girl in the corner is Katy, and she's deaf
and dumb; but Mr.Fay said her name was Rosie, and that she was LAME.And all the others--their names ain't the same, either, and there ain't
any of 'em blind.And, of course, I know now that--that one of those
men is lying to me.Why, they cut them out of the same newspaper;
they've got the same reading on the back!And I--I don't know what to
believe now.And there are all those letters at home that I haven't
answered yet; and they keep coming--why, I just dread to see the
postman turn down our street.I didn't
like his first letter and didn't answer it; and now he says if I don't
send him the money he'll tell everybody everywhere what a stingy
t-tight-wad I am.And another man said he'd come and TAKE it if I
didn't send it; and you KNOW how afraid of burglars I am!Oh what shall
I do, what shall I do?""First, don't you worry another bit,
Miss Flora.Second, just hand those letters over to me--every one of
them.Most rich people have to have secretaries,
you know.""But how'll you know how to answer MY letters?"demanded Miss Flora
dubiously."N-no, not exactly a secretary.But--I've had some experience with
similar letters," observed Mr.I hoped maybe you
could help me some way, but I never thought of that--your answering
'em, I mean.I supposed everybody had to answer their own letters.How'll you know what I want to say?""I shan't be answering what YOU want to say--but what _I_ want to say.In this case, Miss Flora, I exceed the prerogatives of the ordinary
secretary just a bit, you see.But you can count on one thing--I shan't
be spending any money for you.""You won't send them anything, then?"Smith, I want to send some of 'em something!"Of course you do, dear," spoke up Miss Maggie."But you aren't being
either kind or charitable to foster rascally fakes like that," pointing
to the picture in Miss Flora's lap."I'd stake my life on most of 'em," declared Mr."They have all
the earmarks of fakes, all right.""But I was having a beautiful time giving until these horrid letters
began to come.""Flora, do you give because YOU like the sensation of giving, and of
receiving thanks, or because you really want to help somebody?"asked
Miss Maggie, a bit wearily."Why, Maggie Duff, I want to help people, of course," almost wept Miss
Flora."Well, then, suppose you try and give so it will help them, then," said
Miss Maggie."One of the most risky things in the world, to my way of
thinking, is a present of--cash.Y-yes, of course," stammered Mr.Smith, growing
suddenly, for some unapparent reason, very much confused.Smith finished speaking, he threw an oddly nervous glance
into Miss Maggie's face.But Miss Maggie had turned back to Miss Flora."There, dear," she admonished her, "now, you do just as Mr.Just hand over your letters to him for a while, and forget all about
them.He'll tell you how he answers them, of course.But you won't have
to worry about them any more.Besides they'll soon stop coming,--won't
they, Mr.They'll dwindle to a few scattering ones,
anyway,--after I've handled them for a while.""Well, I should like that," sighed Miss Flora."But--can't I give
anything anywhere?""But I would investigate a
little, first, dear.Smith threw a swiftly questioning
glance into Miss Maggie's face."Yes, oh, yes; I believe in--investigation," he said then."And now,
Miss Flora," he added briskly, as Miss Flora reached for her wraps,
"with your kind permission I'll walk home with you and have a look
at--my new job of secretarying."CHAPTER XIX

STILL OTHER FLIES


It was when his duties of secretaryship to Miss Flora had dwindled to
almost infinitesimal proportions that Mr.Smith wished suddenly that he
were serving Miss Maggie in that capacity, so concerned was he over a
letter that had come to Miss Maggie in that morning's mail.He himself had taken it from the letter-carrier's hand and had placed
it on Miss Maggie's little desk.Casually, as he did so, he had noticed
that it bore a name he recognized as that of a Boston law firm; but he
had given it no further thought until later, when, as he sat at his
work in the living-room, he had heard Miss Maggie give a low cry and
had looked up to find her staring at the letter in her hand, her face
going from red to white and back to red again."Why, Miss Maggie, what is it?"As she turned toward him he saw that her eyes were full of tears."Why, it--it's a letter telling me---" She stopped abruptly, her eyes
on his face."Yes, yes, tell me," he begged."Why, you are--CRYING, dear!"Smith, plainly quite unaware of the caressing word he had used, came
nearer, his face aglow with sympathy, his eyes very tender.The red surged once more over Miss Maggie's face.She drew back a
little, though manifestly with embarrassment, not displeasure."It's--nothing, really it's nothing," she stammered."It's just a
letter that--that surprised me.""Oh, well, I--I cry easily sometimes."With hands that shook visibly,
she folded the letter and tucked it into its envelope.Then with a
carelessness that was a little too elaborate, she tossed it into her
open desk.Very plainly, whatever she had meant to do in the first
place, she did not now intend to disclose to Mr."Miss Maggie, please tell me--was it bad news?"Smith thought he detected a break very like a sob in the laugh."But maybe I could--help you," he pleaded."You couldn't--indeed, you couldn't!""Miss Maggie, was it--money matters?"He had his answer in the telltale color that flamed instantly into her
face--but her lips said:--

"It was--nothing--I mean, it was nothing that need concern you."She
hurried away then to the kitchen, and Mr.Smith was left alone to fume
up and down the room and frown savagely at the offending envelope
tiptilted against the ink bottle in Miss Maggie's desk, just as Miss
Maggie's carefully careless hand had thrown it.Miss Maggie had several more letters from the Boston law firm, and Mr.Smith knew it--though he never heard Miss Maggie cry out at any of the
other ones.That they affected her deeply, however, he was certain.Her
very evident efforts to lead him to think that they were of no
consequence would convince him of their real importance to her if
nothing else had done so.He watched her, therefore, covertly,
fearfully, longing to help her, but not daring to offer his services.That the affair had something to do with money matters he was sure.That she would not deny this naturally strengthened him in this belief.He came in time, therefore, to formulate his own opinion: she had lost
money--perhaps a good deal (for her), and she was too proud to let him
or any one else know it.He watched then all the more carefully to see if he could detect any
NEW economies or new deprivations in her daily living.Then, because he
could not discover any such, he worried all the more: if she HAD lost
that money, she ought to economize, certainly.Could she be so foolish
as to carry her desire for secrecy to so absurd a length as to live
just exactly as before when she really could not afford it?Smith requested to have hot water
brought to his room morning and night, for which service he insisted,
in spite of Miss Maggie's remonstrances, on paying three dollars a week
extra.There came a strange man to call one day.He was a member of the Boston
law firm.Smith found out that much, but no more.Miss Maggie was
almost hysterical after his visit.She talked very fast and laughed a
good deal at supper that night; yet her eyes were full of tears nearly
all the time, as Mr."And I suppose she thinks she's hiding it from me--that her heart is
breaking!"Smith savagely to himself, as he watched Miss
Maggie's nervous efforts to avoid meeting his eyes."I vow I'll have it
out of her.I'll have it out--to-morrow!"Smith did not "have it out" with Miss Maggie the following day,
however.Something entirely outside of himself sent his thoughts into a
new channel.He was alone in the Duff living-room, and was idling over his work, at
his table in the corner, when Mrs.Hattie Blaisdell opened the door and
hurried in, wringing her hands.Smith sprang to his feet and hastened toward her."Oh, I don't know--I don't know," moaned the woman, flinging herself
into a chair."There can't anybody do anything, I s'pose; but I've GOT
to have somebody.I can't stay there in that house--I can't--I can't--I
CAN'T!"And you shan't," soothed the man."And she'll
be here soon, I'm sure--Miss Maggie will.But just let me help you off
with your things," he urged, somewhat awkwardly trying to unfasten her
heavy wraps.Impatiently she jerked off the rich fur coat and
tossed it into his arms; then she dropped into the chair again and fell
to wringing her hands."Oh, what shall I do, what shall I do?"Can't I send for--for your husband?"Blaisdell fell to weeping afresh.He's gone--to Fred, you know.""Yes, yes, that's what's the matter.Blaisdell, I'm so sorry!The woman dropped her hands from her face and looked up wildly, half
defiantly.He isn't bad and
wicked, is he?And they can't shut him up if--if we pay it back--all of
it that he took?They won't take my boy--to PRISON?"Smith's face, she began to wring her hands
again.I'll have to tell you--I'll have to," she
moaned."But, my dear woman,--not unless you want to.""I do want to--I do want to!With a visible effort she calmed herself a little and forced
herself to talk more coherently.He wanted seven hundred
dollars and forty-two cents.He said he'd got to have it--if he didn't,
he'd go and KILL himself.He said he'd spent all of his allowance,
every cent, and that's what made him take it--this other money, in the
first place.""You mean--money that didn't belong to him?""Yes; but you mustn't blame him, you mustn't blame him, Mr."Yes; and--Oh, Maggie, Maggie, what shall I do?she
broke off wildly, leaping to her feet as Miss Maggie pushed open the
door and hurried in.Miss Maggie,
white-faced, but with a cheery smile, was throwing off her heavy coat
and her hat.A moment later she came over and took Mrs.Hattie's
trembling hands in both her own."Now, first, tell me all about it,
dear.""Only a little," answered Miss Maggie, gently pushing the other back
into her chair.Jim telephoned him something, just before
he left.She began to wring her hands again, but
Miss Maggie caught and held them firmly."You see, Fred, he was
treasurer of some club, or society, or something; and--and he--he
needed some money to--to pay a man, and he took that--the money that
belonged to the club, you know, and he thought he could pay it back,
little by little.But something happened--I don't know what--a new
treasurer, or something: anyhow, it was going to be found out--that
he'd taken it.It was going to be found out to-morrow, and so he wrote
the letter to his father.But he looked so--oh, I never
saw him look so white and terrible.And I'm so afraid--of what he'll
do--to Fred."Is Jim going to give him the money?"And he's going to give it to him.Oh, they can't shut him
up--they CAN'T send him to prison NOW, can they?"No, they won't send him to prison.If Jim has gone with
the money, Fred will pay it back and nobody will know it.But, Hattie,
Fred DID it, just the same.""And, Hattie, don't you see?Don't you
see where all this is leading?But he isn't going to, any more.He said if his father would help him out of this
scrape, he'd never get into another one, and he'd SHOW him how much he
appreciated it."I'm glad to hear that," cried Miss Maggie."He'll come out all
right, yet."Smith, over at the window, blew his nose
vigorously.Smith had not sat down since Miss Maggie's entrance.He
had crossed to the window, and had stood looking out--at nothing--all
through Mrs."You do think he will, don't you?"Hattie, turning from one
to the other piteously."He said he was ashamed of himself; that this
thing had been an awful lesson to him, and he promised--oh, he promised
lots of things, if Jim would only go up and help him out of this.He'd
never, never have to again.But he will, I know he will, if that
Gaylord fellow stays there.The whole thing was his fault--I know it
was."Why, Hattie, I thought you liked them!"They're mean, stuck-up things, and they snub me awfully.Don't you suppose I know when I'm being snubbed?And that Gaylord
girl--she's just as bad, and she's making my Bessie just like her.I
got Bess into the same school with her, you know, and I was so proud
and happy.Why, my Bess, my own daughter,
actually looks down on us.She's ashamed of her own father and
mother--and she shows it.And it's that Gaylord girl that's done it,
too, I believe.I thought I--I was training my daughter to be a lady--a
real lady; but I never meant to train her to look down on--on her own
mother!""I'm afraid Bessie--needs something of a lesson," commented Miss Maggie
tersely."But Bessie will be older, one of these days, Hattie, and then
she'll--know more.""But that's what I've been trying to teach her--'more,' something more
all the time, Maggie," sighed Mrs."And I've
tried to remember and call her Elizabeth, too.--but I can't.But,
somehow, to-day, nothing seems of any use, any way.And even if she
learns more and more, I don't see as it's going to do any good.I'm not fine enough yet, it seems, for
Mrs.They don't want me among them, and
they show it.And all my old friends are so envious and jealous since
the money came that THEY don't want me, and THEY show it; so I don't
feel comfortable anywhere.""Never mind, dear, just stop trying to live as you think other folks
want you to live, and live as YOU want to, for a while."Hattie smiled faintly, wiped her eyes again, and got to her feet."Well, just try it," smiled Miss Maggie, helping her visitor into the
luxurious fur coat."You've no idea how much more comfort you'll take."Hattie's eyes were wistful, but almost instantly they
showed an alert gleam of anger."Well, anyhow, I'm not going to try to do what those Gaylords do any
longer.And--and you're SURE Fred won't have to go to prison?""I'm very sure," nodded Miss Maggie.You always make
me feel better, Maggie, and you, too, Mr."Now, go home and go to bed, and don't
worry any more or you'll have one of your headaches."As the door closed behind her visitor, Miss Maggie turned and sank into
a chair.She looked worn and white, and utterly weary."I hope she won't meet Frank or Jane anywhere."Do you think they'd blame her--about this
unfortunate affair of Fred's?"I just
came from Frank's, and--"

"Yes?"Something in her face sent a questioning frown to Mr."Do you remember hearing Flora say that Jane had bought a lot of the
Benson gold-mine stock?""Well, Benson has failed; and they've just found out that that
gold-mine stock is worth--about two cents on a dollar."And how much--"

"About forty thousand dollars," said Miss Maggie wearily."Well, I'll be--"

He did not finish his sentence.CHAPTER XX

FRANKENSTEIN: BEING A LETTER FROM JOHN SMITH TO EDWARD D. NORTON,
ATTORNEY AT LAW


DEAR NED:--Wasn't there a story written once about a fellow who created
some sort of a machine man without any soul that raised the very
dickens and all for him?Frank--Frankenstein?--I guess that was it.Well, I've created a Frankenstein creature--and I'm dead up against it
to know what to do with him.Ned, what in Heaven's name am I going to do with Mr.John Smith, let me tell you, is a very healthy, persistent, insistent,
important person, with many kind friends, a definite position in the
world, and no small degree of influence.Worse yet (now prepare for a
stunning blow, Ned!Smith has been so inconsiderate as to fall in
love.And he has fallen in love as absolutely and as
idiotically as if he were twenty-one instead of fifty-two.Now, will
you kindly tell me how Mr.John Smith is going to fade away into
nothingness?And, even if he finds the way to do that, shall he, before
fading, pop the question for Mr.Stanley G. Fulton, or shall he trust
to Mr.Stanley G. Fulton's being able to win for himself the love Mr.Seriously, joking aside, I'm afraid I've made a mess of things, not
only for myself, but for everybody else.I'll spare you rhapsodies, Ned.They say, anyway,
that there's no fool like an old fool.But I will admit that that
future looks very dark to me if I am not to have the companionship of
the little woman, Maggie Duff.Oh, yes, it's "Poor Maggie."As for Miss Maggie herself, perhaps it's
conceited, but I believe she's not entirely indifferent to Mr.Stanley G. Fulton I have my doubts; but,
alas!I have no doubts whatever as to what her opinion will be of Mr.Stanley G. Fulton's masquerading as Mr.Stanley G. Fulton the job he's got on his hands to put himself
right with her, either.But there's one thing he can be sure of, at
least; if she does care for Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton's money that was the bait.you see already I have adopted the Hillerton
vernacular.)But I fear Miss Maggie is indeed "poor" now.She has had
several letters that I don't like the looks of, and a call from a
villainous-looking man from Boston--one of your craft, I believe
(begging your pardon).I think she's lost some money, and I don't
believe she had any extra to lose.She's as proud as Lucifer, however,
and she's determined no one shall find out she's lost any money, so her
laugh is gayer than ever.I can hear
something in her voice that isn't laughter.Ned, what a mess I HAVE made of it!I feel more than ever now
like the boy with his ear to the keyhole.These people are my
friends--or, rather, they are Mr.As for being
mine--who am I, Smith, or Fulton?Will they be Fulton's friends, after
they find he is John Smith?Will they be Smith's friends, even, after
they find he is Fulton?Oh, yes, I can hear you say that it serves me right, and that you
warned me, and that I was deaf to all remonstrances.Now, we'll waste no more time on that.I've acknowledged my error, and my transgression is ever
before me.I built the box, I walked into it, and I deliberately shut
the cover down.I've got to get out--some
way.I can't spend the rest of my natural existence as John Smith,
hunting Blaisdell data--though sometimes I think I'd be willing to, if
it's the only way to stay with Miss Maggie.I tell you, that little
woman can make a home out of--

But I couldn't stay with Miss Maggie.John Smith wouldn't have money
enough to pay his board, to say nothing of inviting Miss Maggie to
board with him, would he?Stanley G. Fulton's last
will and testament on the first day of next November will effectually
cut off Mr.There is no provision in the
will for Mr.I don't think
he'd like that.By the way, I wonder: do you suppose John Smith could
earn--his salt, if he was hard put to it?Very plainly, then, something
has got to be done about getting John Smith to fade away, and Stanley
G. Fulton to appear before next November.And I had thought it would be so easy!Early this summer John Smith was
to pack up his Blaisdell data, bid a pleasant adieu to Hillerton, and
betake himself to South America.In due course, after a short trip to
some obscure Inca city, or down some little-known river, Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton would arrive at some South American hotel from the interior, and
would take immediate passage for the States, reaching Chicago long
before November first.There would be a slight flurry, of course, and a few annoying
interviews and write-ups; but Mr.Stanley G. Fulton always was known to
keep his affairs to himself pretty well, and the matter would soon be
put down as merely another of the multi-millionaire's eccentricities.The whole thing would then be all over, and well over.But--nowhere had
there been taken into consideration the possibilities of--a Maggie
Duff.And now, to me, that same Maggie Duff is the only thing worth
considering--anywhere.And even after all this, I haven't accomplished what I set out to
do--that is, find the future possessor of the Fulton millions (unless
Miss Maggie--bless her!--says "yes."And even then, some one will have
to have them after us).As
conditions are now, I should not want either Frank, or James, or Flora
to have them--not unless the millions could bring them more happiness
than these hundred thousand apiece have brought.Honest, Ned, that miserable money has made more--But, never mind.It's
too long a story to write.I'll tell you when I see you--if I ever do
see you.There's still the possibility, you know, that Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton is lost in darkest South America, and of course John Smith CAN
go to work!I believe I won't sign any name--I haven't got any name--that I feel
really belongs to me now.Still I might--yes, I will sign it

SYMPATHIES MISPLACED


The first time Mr.Smith saw Frank Blaisdell, after Miss Maggie's news
of the forty-thousand-dollar loss, he tried, somewhat awkwardly, to
express his interest and sympathy.But Frank Blaisdell cut him short."That's all right, and I thank you," he cried heartily."And I know
most folks would think losing forty thousand dollars was about as bad
as it could be.Jane, now, is all worked up over it; can't sleep
nights, and has gone back to turning down the gas and eating sour cream
so's to save and help make it up.But me--I call it the best thing that
ever happened."Smith; "I'm sure that's a very delightful
way to look at it--if you can.""Well, I can; and I'll tell you why.It's put me back where I
belong--behind the counter of a grocery store.Oh, I had enough left for that, and more!Gorry, but I was glad to feel the old floor under my feet again!""But I thought you--you were tired of work, and--wanted to enjoy
yourself," stammered Mr."Tired of work--wanted to enjoy myself, indeed!Yes, I know I did say
something like that.But, let me tell you this, Mr.Talk about
work!--I never worked so hard in my life as I have the last ten months
trying to enjoy myself.How these folks can stand gadding 'round the
country week in and week out, feeding their stomachs on a French
dictionary instead of good United States meat and potatoes and squash,
and spending their days traipsing off to see things they ain't a mite
interested in, and their nights trying to get rested so they can go and
see some more the next day, I don't understand.""I'm afraid these touring agencies wouldn't like to have you write
their ads for them, Mr."Well, they hadn't better ask me to," smiled the other grimly.Since I come back I've been working even harder trying
to enjoy myself here at home--knockin' silly little balls over a
ten-acre lot in a game a healthy ten-year-old boy would scorn to play.""Oh, yes, I enjoyed the riding well enough; but I didn't enjoy hunting
for punctures, putting on new tires, or burrowing into the inside of
the critter to find out why she didn't go!And that's what I was doing
most of the time.He paused a moment, then went on a little wistfully:--

"I suspect, Mr.Smith, there ain't anything in my line but groceries.If--if I had my life to
live over again, I'd do different, maybe.I'd see if I couldn't find
out what there was in a picture to make folks stand and stare at it an
hour at a time when you could see the whole thing in a minute--and it
wa'n't worth lookin' at, anyway, even for a minute.Now, I like a good tune what is a tune; but them caterwaulings and
dirges that that chap Gray plays on that fiddle of his--gorry, Mr.Smith, I'd rather hear the old barn door at home squeak any day.But if
I was younger I'd try to learn to like 'em.She can set by the hour in front of that phonygraph of hers, and
not know it!""And there's books, too," resumed the other, still wistfully."I'd read
books--if I could stay awake long enough to do it--and I'd find out
what there was in 'em to make a good sensible man like Jim Blaisdell
daft over 'em--and Maggie Duff, too.Why, that little woman used to go
hungry sometimes, when she was a girl, so she could buy a book she
wanted.Why, I'd 'a' given anything this last year if I
could 'a' got interested--really interested, readin'.I could 'a'
killed an awful lot of time that way.I bought a
lot of 'em, too, an' tried it; but I expect I didn't begin young
enough.Smith, I've about come to the conclusion that
there ain't a thing in the world so hard to kill as time.I've tried
it, and I know.Why, I got so I couldn't even kill it EATIN'--though I
'most killed myself TRYIN' to!A full
stomach ain't in it with bein' hungry an' knowing a good dinner's
coming.Why, there was whole weeks at a time back there that I didn't
know the meaning of the word 'hungry.'You'd oughter seen the jolt I
give one o' them waiter-chaps one day when he comes up with his paper
and his pencil and asks me what I wanted.'There ain't
but one thing on this earth I want, and you can't give it to me.I'm tired of bein' so blamed satisfied all the
time!'""And what did--Alphonso say to that?"Oh, the waiter-fellow, you mean?Oh, he just stared a
minute, then mumbled his usual 'Yes, sir, very good, sir,' and shoved
that confounded printed card of his a little nearer to my nose.I guess you've heard enough of this, Mr.It's only that I
was trying to tell you why I'm actually glad we lost that money.It's
give me back my man's job again."I won't waste any more sympathy on you,"
laughed Mr.I hope it'll give me
back a little of my old faith in my fellow-man."I won't suspect every man, woman, and child that says a
civil word to me now of having designs on my pocketbook.Smith, you wouldn't believe it, if I told you, the things that's been
done and said to get a little money out of me.Of course, the open
gold-brick schemes I knew enough to dodge,'most of 'em (unless you
count in that darn Benson mining stock), and I spotted the blackmailers
all right, most generally.But I WAS flabbergasted when a WOMAN tackled
the job and began to make love to me--actually make love to me!--one
day when Jane's back was turned.DO I look such a fool as that,
Mr.Well, anyhow, there won't be any more of that kind, nor
anybody after my money now, I guess," he finished with a sage wag of
his head as he turned away.Smith said, after recounting the
earlier portion of the conversation: "So you see you were right, after
all.Frank Blaisdell had plenty to
retire upon, but nothing to retire to.But I'm glad--if he's happy now.""And he isn't the only one that that forty-thousand-dollar loss has
done a good turn to," nodded Miss Maggie."Mellicent has just been
here.It's the Easter vacation,
anyway, but she isn't going back.Miss Maggie spoke with studied casualness, but there was an added color
in her cheeks--Miss Maggie always flushed a little when she mentioned
Mellicent's name to Mr.Smith, in spite of her indignant efforts not to
do so.Well, the Pennocks had a dance last night, and Mellicent went.She said she had to laugh to see Mrs.Pennock's efforts to keep Carl
away from her--the loss of the money is known everywhere now, and has
been greatly exaggerated, I've heard.She said that even Hibbard
Gaylord had the air of one trying to let her down easy.Mellicent was
immensely amused."He doesn't move in the Pennock crowd much.But
Mellicent sees him, and--and everything's all right there, now.That's
why Mellicent is so happy.""You mean--Has her mother given in?"You see, Jane was at the dance, too, and she saw Carl, and she
saw Hibbard Gaylord.She told Mellicent this
morning that she had her opinion of fellows who would show so plainly
as Carl Pennock and Hibbard Gaylord did that it was the money they were
after."Jane has changed her shoes again," murmured Mr.Miss Maggie's puzzled frown gave way to a laugh."Well, yes, perhaps the shoe is on the other foot again.But, anyway,
she doesn't love Carl or Hibbard any more, and she does love Donald
Gray.He HASN'T let the loss of the money make any difference to him,
you see.He's been even more devoted, if anything.She told Mellicent
this morning that he was a very estimable young man, and she liked him
very much.Perhaps you see now why Mellicent is--happy."I'm glad to know it," cried Mr."I'm glad--" His
face changed suddenly."I'm glad the LOSS of the
money brought them some happiness--if the possession of it didn't," he
finished moodily, turning to go to his own room.At the hall door he
paused and looked back at Miss Maggie, standing by the table, gazing
after him with troubled eyes."Did Mellicent say--whether Fred was
there?"He didn't come home for this vacation
at all.I suspect Mellicent doesn't know
anything about that wretched affair of his."So the young gentleman didn't show up at all?"Hattie didn't
go to the Pennocks' either.Hattie has--has been very different since
this affair of Fred's.I think it frightened her terribly--it was so
near a tragedy; the boy threatened to kill himself, you know, if his
father didn't help him out.""Yes, I know he did; and I'm afraid he found things in a pretty bad
mess--when he got there," sighed Miss Maggie."It was a bad mess all
around.""It is, indeed, a bad mess all around," he growled as he
disappeared through the door.Behind him, Miss Maggie still stood motionless, looking after him with
troubled eyes.As the spring days grew warmer, Miss Maggie had occasion many times to
look after Mr.One day he would be the old delightful companion, genial,
cheery, generously donating a box of chocolates to the center-table
bonbon dish or a dozen hothouse roses to the mantel vase.The next, he
would be nervous, abstracted, almost irritable.Yet she could see no
possible reason for the change.Sometimes she wondered fearfully if Mellicent could have anything to do
with it.Was it possible that he had cared for Mellicent, and to see
her now so happy with Donald Gray was more than he could bear?There was his own statement that he had devoted
himself to her solely and only to help keep the undesirable lovers away
and give Donald Gray a chance.Besides, had he not said that he was not a marrying man, anyway?To be
sure, that seemed a pity--a man so kind and thoughtful and so
delightfully companionable!But then, it was nothing to her, of
course--only she did hope he was not feeling unhappy over Mellicent!Smith would not bring flowers and
candy so often.She felt as if he were spending too
much money--and she had got the impression in some way that he did not
have any too much money to spend.And there were the expensive motor
trips, too--she feared Mr.Yet she could not
tell him so, of course.He never seemed to realize the value of a
dollar, anyway, and he very obviously did not know how to get the most
out of it.Look at his foolish generosity in regard to the board he
paid her!Miss Maggie wondered sometimes if it might not be worry over money
matters that was making him so nervous and irritable on occasions now.Plainly he was very near the end of his work there in Hillerton.He was
not getting so many letters on Blaisdell matters from away, either.For
a month now he had done nothing but a useless repetition of old work;
and of late, a good deal of the time, he was not even making that
pretense of being busy.For days at a time he would not touch his
records.That could mean but one thing, of course; his work was done.Yet he seemed to be making no move toward departure.Not that she
wanted him to go.She should miss him very much when he went, of
course.But she did not like to feel that he was staying simply because
he had nowhere to go and nothing to do.Miss Maggie did not believe in
able-bodied men who had nowhere to go and nothing to do--and she wanted
very much to believe in Mr.She had been under the impression that he was getting the Blaisdell
material together for a book, and that he was intending to publish it
himself.His book must be ready, but he was making no move to
publish it.To Miss Maggie this could mean but one thing: some
financial reverses had made it impossible for him to carry out his
plans, and had left him stranded with no definite aim for the future.She was so sorry!--but there seemed to be nothing that she could do.She HAD tried to help by insisting that he pay less for his board; but
he had not only scouted that idea, but had brought her more chocolates
and flowers than ever--for all the world as if he had divined her
suspicions and wished to disprove them.Smith was trying to keep something from her, Miss Maggie was
sure.She was the more sure, perhaps, because she herself had something
that she was trying to keep from Mr.Smith--and she thought she
recognized the symptoms.Meanwhile April budded into May, and May blossomed into June; and June
brought all the Blaisdells together again in Hillerton.CHAPTER XXII

WITH EVERY JIM A JAMES


Two days after Fred Blaisdell had returned from college, his mother
came to see Miss Maggie.Smith was rearranging the books on Miss
Maggie's shelves and trying to make room for the new ones he had
brought her through the winter.Hattie came in, red-eyed and
flushed-faced, he ceased his work at once and would have left the room,
but she stopped him with a gesture.You know all about it, anyway,--and I'd just as soon you
knew the rest.I just came down to talk
things over with Maggie.I--I'm sure I don't know w-what I'm going to
do--when I can't.""But you always can, dear," soothed Miss Maggie cheerily, handing her
visitor a fan and taking a chair near her.Smith, after a moment's hesitation, turned quietly back to his
bookshelves."Why, Hattie Blaisdell, where are you going?"I
guess we can still see each other.Now, tell me, what does all this
mean?""Well, of course, it began with Fred--his trouble, you know.""But I thought Jim fixed that all up, dear."He paid the money, and nobody there at college knew a
thing about it.Fred told us some of them
night before last.He says he's ashamed of himself, but that he
believes there's enough left in him to make a man of him yet.But he
says he can't do it--there.""You mean--he doesn't want to go back to college?"Miss Maggie's voice
showed her disappointment."Oh, he wants to go to college--but not there.""He says he's had too much money to spend--and that 't wouldn't be easy
not to spend it--if he was back there, in the old crowd."Well, that's all right, isn't it?"He's awfully happy over it, and--and I
guess I am."But now, what is this about Plainville?""Oh, that
grew out of it--all this.Hammond is going to open a new office in
Plainville and he's offered Jim--James--no, JIM--I'm not going to call
him 'James' any more!--the chance to manage it.""Well, that's fine, I'm sure.""Yes, of course that part is fine--splendid.He'll get a bigger salary,
and all that, and--and I guess I'm glad to go, anyway--I don't like
Hillerton any more.I haven't got any friends here, Maggie.Of course,
I wouldn't have anything to do with the Gaylords now, after what's
happened,--that boy getting my boy to drink and gamble, and--and
everything.And yet--YOU know how I've strained every nerve for years,
and worked and worked to get where my children could--COULD be with
them!""It didn't pay, did it, Hattie?"They're perfectly horrid--every one of them, and I
hate them!"Look at what they've done to Fred, and Bessie, too!I
shan't let HER be with them any more, either.There aren't any folks
here we can be with now.That's why I don't mind going away.All our
friends that we used to know don't like us any more, they're so jealous
on account of the money.Oh, yes, I know you think I'm to blame for
that," she went on aggrievedly."I can see you do, by your face.But it was just so I could get ahead.Miss Maggie looked as if she would like to say
something more--but she did not say it.Smith was abstractedly opening and shutting
the book in his hand.He had not
touched the books on the shelves for some time."And look at how I've tried and see what it has come to--Bessie so
high-headed and airy she makes fun of us, and Fred a gambler and a
drunkard, and'most a thief.And it's all that horrid hundred thousand
dollars!"Smith's hand slipped to the floor with a bang; but no
one was noticing Mr."Oh, Hattie, don't blame the hundred thousand dollars," cried Miss
Maggie."Jim says it was, and Fred does, too.Fred said it
was all just the same kind of a way that I'd tried to make folks call
Jim 'James.'He said I'd been trying to make every single 'Jim' we had
into a 'James,' until I'd taken away all the fun of living.And I
suppose maybe he's right, too.""Well,
anyhow, I'm not going to do it any more.There isn't any fun in it,
anyway.It doesn't make any difference how hard I tried to get ahead, I
always found somebody else a little 'aheader' as Benny calls it."There isn't any use--in that kind of trying, Hattie."Jim said I was like the little boy that
they asked what would make him the happiest of anything in the world,
and he answered, 'Everything that I haven't got.'And I suppose I have
been something like that.But I don't see as I'm any worse than other
folks.Everybody goes for money; but I'm sure I don't see why--if it
doesn't make them any happier than it has me!"We shall begin to pack the first of the
month.It looks like a mountain to me, but Jim and Fred say they'll
help, and--"

Mr.Smith did not hear any more, for Miss Maggie and her guest had
reached the hall and had closed the door behind them.But when Miss
Maggie returned, Mr.Smith was pacing up and down the room nervously."Well," he demanded with visible irritation, as soon as she appeared,
"will you kindly tell me if there is anything--desirable--that that
confounded money has done?""You mean--Jim Blaisdell's money?""I mean all the money--I mean the three hundred thousand dollars that
those three people received.Has it ever brought any good or
happiness--anywhere?""Oh, yes, I know," smiled Miss Maggie, a little sadly."But--" Her
countenance changed abruptly.A passionate earnestness came to her
eyes."Don't blame the money--blame the SPENDING of it!The dollar that will buy tickets to the movies will just as
quickly buy a good book; and if you're hungry, it's up to you whether
you put your money into chocolate eclairs or roast beef.Is the MONEY
to blame that goes for a whiskey bill or a gambling debt instead of for
shoes and stockings for the family?"Smith had apparently lost his own irritation in his
amazement at hers."Why, Miss Maggie, you--you seem worked up over this
matter."It's been money,
money, money, ever since I could remember!We're all after it, and we
all want it, and we strain every nerve to get it.We think it's going
to bring us happiness.But it won't--unless we do our part.And there
are some things that even money can't buy.Besides, it isn't the money
that does the things, anyway,--it's the man behind the money.What do
you think money is good for, Mr.Smith, now thoroughly dazed, actually blinked his eyes at the
question, and at the vehemence with which it was hurled into his face."Why, Miss Maggie, it--it--I--I--"

"It isn't good for anything unless we can exchange it for something we
want, is it?""Why, I--I suppose we can GIVE it--"

"But even then we're exchanging it for something we want, aren't we?We
want to make the other fellow happy, don't we?""But it doesn't
always work that way.Now, very likely
this--er--Mr.Fulton thought those three hundred thousand dollars were
going to make these people happy.Personification of happiness--that
woman was, a few minutes ago, wasn't she?"Smith had regained his
air of aggrieved irritation.She
didn't know how to spend it.And that's just what I mean when I say
we've got to do our part--money won't buy happiness, unless we exchange
it for the things that will bring happiness.If we don't know how to
get any happiness out of five dollars, we won't know how to get it out
of five hundred, or five thousand, or five hundred thousand, Mr.I don't mean that we'll get the same amount out of five dollars, of
course,--though I've seen even that happen sometimes!--but I mean that
we've got to know how to spend five dollars--and to make the most of
it.""I reckon--you're right, Miss Maggie.""I know I'm right, and 't isn't the money's fault when things go wrong.Oh, yes, I know--we're taught that the
love of money is the root of all evil.But I don't think it should be
so--necessarily.I think money's one of the most wonderful things in
the world.It's more than a trust and a gift--it's an opportunity, and
a test.It brings out what's strongest in us, every time.And it does
that whether it's five dollars or five hundred thousand dollars.If--if
we love chocolate eclairs and the movies better than roast beef and
good books, we're going to buy them, whether they're chocolate eclairs
and movies on five dollars, or or--champagne suppers and Paris gowns on
five hundred thousand dollars!"Miss Maggie gave a shamefaced laugh and sank back in her chair."You don't know what to think of me, of course; and no wonder," she
sighed."But I've felt so bad over this--this money business right here
under my eyes.I love them all, every one of them.And YOU know how
it's been, Mr.Hasn't it worked out to prove just what I say?She said that Fred declared she'd been
trying to make every one of her 'Jims' a 'James,' ever since the money
came.But he forgot that she did that very same thing before it came.All her life she's been trying to make five dollars look like ten; so
when she got the hundred thousand, it wasn't six months before she was
trying to make that look like two hundred thousand."Jane used to buy ingrain carpets and cheap
chairs and cover them with mats and tidies to save them.""They got on your nerves, too, didn't they?Such layers upon layers of
covers for everything!It brought me to such a pass that I went to the
other extreme.I wouldn't protect ANYTHING--which was very
reprehensible, of course.Well, now she has pretty dishes and solid
silver--but she hides them in bags and boxes, and never uses them
except for company.She doesn't take any more comfort with them than
she did with the ingrain carpets and cheap chairs.Of course, that's a
little thing.When you can't spend five
cents out of a hundred dollars for pleasure without wincing, you
needn't expect you're going to spend five dollars out of a hundred
thousand without feeling the pinch," laughed Miss Maggie."Poor Flora--and when she tried so hard to quiet her conscience because
she had so much money!She told me yesterday that she
hardly ever gets a begging letter now.""No; and those she does get she investigates," asserted Mr."So
the fakes don't bother her much these days.And she's doing a lot of
good, too, in a small way.""She is, and she's happy now," declared Miss Maggie, "except that she
still worries a little because she is so happy.She's dismissed the
maid and does her own work--I'm afraid Miss Flora never was cut out for
a fine-lady life of leisure, and she loves to putter in the kitchen.She says it's such a relief, too, not to keep dressed up in company
manners all the time, and not to have that horrid girl spying 'round
all day to see if she behaves proper.and I reckon it worked the best with her of any of them.""Er--that is, I mean, perhaps she's made the best use of the hundred
thousand," stammered Mr."She's been--er--the happiest.""Why, y-yes, perhaps she has, when you come to look at it that way.""But you wouldn't--er--advise this Mr.Fulton to leave her--his twenty
millions?"laughed Miss Maggie, throwing up both hands."She'd faint dead
away at the mere thought of it."Smith turned on his heel and resumed
his restless pacing up and down the room.From time to time he glanced
furtively at Miss Maggie.Miss Maggie, her hands idly resting in her
lap, palms upward, was gazing fixedly at nothing.he demanded at last, coming to a
pause at her side.Stanley G. Fulton," she answered, not looking
up.The odd something had increased, but Miss Maggie's eyes
were still dreamily fixed on space.I was wondering what he had done with them.""Yes, in the letter, I mean."There was a letter--a second letter to be opened
in two years' time.They said that that was to dispose of the remainder
of the property--his last will and testament.""Oh, yes, I remember," assented Mr.Smith was very carefully not
meeting Miss Maggie's eyes.Miss Maggie turned back to her meditative
gazing at nothing."The two years are nearly up, you know,--I was
talking with Jane the other day--just next November."The words were very near a groan, but at once Mr.Smith
hurriedly repeated, "I know--I know!"very lightly, indeed, with an
apprehensive glance at Miss Maggie."So it seems to me if he were alive that he'd be back by this time.And
so I was wondering--about those millions," she went on musingly."What
do YOU suppose he has done with them?"she asked, with sudden
animation, turning full upon him."Why, I--I--How should I know?"Smith, a swift crimson
dyeing his face."You wouldn't, of course--but that needn't make you look as if I'd
intimated that YOU had them!I was only asking for your opinion, Mr.Smith," she twinkled, with mischievous eyes.Smith laughed now, a little precipitately."But,
indeed, Miss Maggie, you turned so suddenly and the question was so
unexpected that I felt like the small boy who, being always blamed for
everything at home that went wrong, answered tremblingly, when the
teacher sharply demanded, 'Who made the world?''Please, ma'am, I did;
but I'll never do it again!'"Smith, when Miss Maggie had done laughing at his
little story, "suppose I turn the tables on you?Miss Maggie shifted her position, her
face growing intently interested again."I've been trying to remember
what I know of the man.""Yes, from the newspaper and magazine accounts of him.Of course, there
was quite a lot about him at the time the money came; and Flora let me
read some things she'd saved, in years gone.Flora was always
interested in him, you know.""Why, not much, really, about the man.Besides, very likely what I did
find wasn't true.But
I was trying to find out how he'd spent his money himself.I thought
that might give me a clue--about the will, I mean.""Yes; but I didn't find much.In spite of his reported eccentricities,
he seems to me to have done nothing very extraordinary.""He doesn't seem to have been very bad.""Nor very good either, for that matter.""Sort of a--nonentity, perhaps.""Perhaps--though I suppose he couldn't really be that--not very
well--with twenty millions, could he?But I mean, he wasn't very bad,
nor very good.He didn't seem to be dissipated, or mixed up in any
scandal, or to be recklessly extravagant, like so many rich men.On the
other hand, I couldn't find that he'd done any particular good in the
world.Some charities were mentioned, but they were perfunctory,
apparently, and I don't believe, from the accounts, that he ever really
INTERESTED himself in any one--that he ever really cared for--any one."If Miss Maggie had looked up, she would have met a
most disconcerting expression in the eyes bent upon her.But Miss
Maggie did not look up."Why, he didn't even have a wife and
children to stir him from his selfishness.He had a secretary, of
course, and he probably never saw half his begging letters.I can
imagine his tossing them aside with a languid 'Fix them up,
James,--give the creatures what they want, only don't bother me.'"Smith; then, hastily: "I'm sure he never
did."But when I think of what he might
do--Twenty millions!But he didn't
do--anything--worth while with them, so far as I can see, when he was
living, so that's why I can't imagine what his will may be.Probably
the same old perfunctory charities, however, with the Chicago law firm
instead of 'James' as disburser--unless, of course, Hattie's
expectations are fulfilled, and he divides them among the Blaisdells
here.""You think--there's something worth while he MIGHT have done with those
millions, then?"Smith, a sudden peculiar wistfulness in
his eyes."Something he MIGHT have done with them!""Why,
it seems to me there's no end to what he might have done--with twenty
millions."Smith came nearer, his face working with emotion."Miss
Maggie, if a man with twenty millions--that is, could you love a man
with twenty millions, if--if Mr.Fulton should ask you--if _I_ were Mr.Fulton--if--" His countenance changed suddenly.He drew himself up with
a cry of dismay."Oh, no--no--I've spoiled it all now.That isn't what
I meant to say first.I was going to find out--I mean, I was going to
tell--Oh, good Heavens, what a--That confounded money--again!"Smith, w-what--" Only the crisp shutting of the door answered
her.With a beseeching look and a despairing gesture Mr.Then, turning to sit down, she came face to face with her own
image in the mirror."Well, now you've done it, Maggie Duff," she whispered wrathfully to
the reflection in the glass.He was--was
going to say something--I know he was.You've talked money,
money, MONEY to him for an hour.You said you LOVED money; and you told
what you'd do--if you had twenty millions of dollars.And you know--you
KNOW he's as poor as Job's turkey, and that just now he's more than
ever plagued over--money!As
if that counted against--"

With a little sobbing cry Miss Maggie covered her face with her hands
and sat down, helplessly, angrily.CHAPTER XXIII

REFLECTIONS--MIRRORED AND OTHERWISE


Miss Maggie was still sitting in the big chair with her face in her
hands when the door opened and Mr.Miss Maggie, dropping her hands and starting up at his entrance, caught
a glimpse of his face in the mirror in front of her.With a furtive,
angry dab of her fingers at her wet eyes, she fell to rearranging the
vases and photographs on the mantel."Miss Maggie, I've got to face this thing out, of course.Even if I
had--made a botch of things at the very start, it didn't help any
to--to run away, as I did.It was only
because I--I--But never mind that.I'm coming now straight to the
point.Miss Maggie, will you--marry me?"The photograph in Miss Maggie's hand fell face down on the shelf.Miss
Maggie's fingers caught the edge of the mantel in a convulsive grip.A
swift glance in the mirror before her disclosed Mr.Smith's face just
over her shoulder, earnest, pleading, and still very white.She dropped
her gaze, and turned half away.She tried to speak, but only a half-choking little
breath came."Miss Maggie, please don't say no--yet.Let me--explain--about how I
came here, and all that.But first, before I do that, let me tell you
how--how I love you--how I have loved you all these long months.I
THINK I loved you from the first time I saw you.Whatever comes, I want
you to know that.And if you could care for me a little--just a little,
I'm sure I could make it more--in time, so you would marry me.Don't you believe I'd try to make you happy--dear?""Yes, oh, yes," murmured Miss Maggie, still with her head turned away.Then all you've got to say is that you'll let me try.Why, until I came here to this little house, I
didn't know what living, real living, was.And I HAVE been, just as
you said, a selfish old thing."Miss Maggie, with a start of surprise, faced the image in the mirror;
but Mr.Smith was looking at her, not at her reflection, so she did not
meet his ayes."Why, I never--" she stammered."Yes, you did, a minute ago.Oh, of course you
didn't realize--everything, and perhaps you wouldn't have said it if
you'd known.But you said it--and you meant it, and I'm glad you said
it.And, dear little woman, don't you see?That's only another reason
why you should say yes.You can show me how not to be selfish."Smith, I--I-" stammered Miss Maggie, still with puzzled eyes.You can show me how to make life really worth while, for
me, and for--for lots of others And NOW I have some one to care for.And, oh, little woman, I--I care so much, it can't be that you--you
don't care--any!"Miss Maggie caught her breath and turned away again.The red crept up Miss Maggie's neck to her forehead but still she was
silent."If I could only see your eyes," pleaded the man.Then, suddenly, he
saw Miss Maggie's face in the mirror.The next moment Miss Maggie
herself turned a little, and in the mirror their eyes met--and in the
mirror Mr."You DO care--a LITTLE!"he
breathed, as he took her in his arms.Miss Maggie shook her head vigorously against his
coat-collar."I care--a GREAT DEAL," whispered Miss Maggie to the coat-collar, with
shameless emphasis.triumphed the man, bestowing a rapturous kiss on the
tip of a small pink ear--the nearest point to Miss Maggie's lips that
was available, until, with tender determination, he turned her face to
his.A moment later, blushing rosily, Miss Maggie drew herself away."There, we've been quite silly enough--old folks like us."Love is never silly--not real love like ours.Besides,
we're only as old as we feel.I've
lost--YEARS since this morning.And you know I'm just beginning to
live--really live, anyway!"I'm afraid you act it," said Miss Maggie, with mock severity."YOU would--if you'd been through what _I_ have," retorted Mr."And when I think what a botch I made of it, to
begin with--You see, I didn't mean to start off with that, first thing;
and I was so afraid that--that even if you did care for John Smith, you
wouldn't for me--just at first.At arms' length he
held her off, his hands on her shoulders.His happy eyes searching her
face saw the dawn of the dazed, question."Wouldn't care for YOU if I did for John Smith!she demanded, her eyes slowly sweeping him
from head to foot and back again.Instinctively his tongue went back to the old manner of
address, but his hands still held her shoulders."You don't mean--you
can't mean that--that you didn't understand--that you DON'T understand
that I am--Oh, good Heavens!Well, I have made a mess of it this time,"
he groaned.Releasing his hold on her shoulders, he turned and began to
tramp up and down the room."Nice little John-Alden-Miles-Standish
affair this is now, upon my word!Miss Maggie, have I got to--to
propose to you all over again for--for another man, now?"I--I don't think I understand you.""Then you don't know--you didn't understand a few minutes ago, when
I--I spoke first, when I asked you about--about those twenty millions--"

She lifted her hand quickly, pleadingly.Smith, please, don't let's bring money into it at all.I don't
care--I don't care a bit if you haven't got any money.""If I HAVEN'T got any money!"Oh, yes, I know, I said I loved money."The rich red came back to
her face in a flood."But I didn't mean--And it's just as much of a
test and an opportunity when you DON'T have money--more so, if
anything.I never thought of--of how you
might take it--as if I WANTED it.Oh, can't
you--understand?""And I
thought I'd given myself away!He came to her and stood
close, but he did not offer to touch her."I thought, after I'd said
what I did about--about those twenty millions that you understood--that
you knew I was--Stanley Fulton himself."Miss Maggie stood motionless, her eyes looking
straight into his, amazed incredulous.Maggie, don't look at me
like that.She was backing away now, slowly, step by step.Anger, almost loathing,
had taken the place of the amazement and incredulity in her eyes.But--" "And you've been here all these months--yes,
years--under a false name, pretending to be what you weren't--talking
to us, eating at our tables, winning our confidence, letting us talk to
you about yourself, even pretending that--Oh, how could you?""Maggie, dearest," he begged, springing toward her, "if you'll only let
me--"

But she stopped him peremptorily, drawing herself to her full height."I am NOT your dearest," she flamed angrily."I did not give my
love--to YOU."I gave it to John Smith--gentleman, I supposed.A man--poor, yes,
I believed him poor; but a man who at least had a right to his NAME!Stanley G. Fulton, spy, trickster, who makes life
itself a masquerade for SPORT!Stanley G. Fulton,
and--I do not wish to."The words ended in a sound very like a sob; but
Miss Maggie, with her head still high, turned her back and walked to
the window.The man, apparently stunned for a moment, stood watching her, his eyes
grieved, dismayed, hopeless.Then, white-faced, he turned and walked
toward the door.With his hand almost on the knob he slowly wheeled
about and faced the woman again.He hesitated visibly, then in a dull,
lifeless voice he began to speak."Miss Maggie, before John Smith steps entirely out of your life, he
would like to say just this, please, not on justification, but on
explanation of----of Stanley G. Fulton.Fulton did not intend to be a
spy, or a trickster, or to make life a masquerade for--sport.He was a
lonely old man--he felt old.True, he had no
one to care for, but--he had no one to care for HIM, either.He did have a great deal of money--more than he knew what
to do with.Oh, he tried--various ways of spending it.They resulted, chiefly,
in showing him that he wasn't--as wise as he might be in that line,
perhaps."At the window Miss Maggie still stood,
with her back turned as before."The time came, finally," resumed the man, "when Fulton began to wonder
what would become of his millions when he was done with them.He had a
feeling that he would like to will a good share of them to some of his
own kin; but he had no nearer relatives than some cousins back East,
in--Hillerton."Miss Maggie at the window drew in her breath, and held it suspended,
letting it out slowly."He didn't know anything about these cousins," went on the man dully,
wearily, "and he got to wondering what they would do with the money.I
think he felt, as you said to-day that you feel, that one must know how
to spend five dollars if one would get the best out of five thousand.So Fulton felt that, before he gave a man fifteen or twenty millions,
he would like to know--what he would probably do with them.He had seen
so many cases where sudden great wealth had brought--great sorrow."And so then he fixed up a little scheme; he would give each one of
these three cousins of his a hundred thousand dollars apiece, and then,
unknown to them, he would get acquainted with them, and see which of
them would be likely to make the best use of those twenty millions.It
was a silly scheme, of course,--a silly, absurd foolishness from
beginning to end.It--"

He did not finish his sentence.There was a rush of swift feet, a swish
of skirts, then full upon him there fell a whirlwind of sobs, clinging
arms, and incoherent ejaculations."It wasn't silly--it wasn't silly.Oh, I think it was--WONDERFUL!And
I--I'm so ASHAMED!"Later--very much later, when something like lucid coherence had become
an attribute of their conversation, as they sat together upon the old
sofa, the man drew a long breath and said:--

"Then I'm quite forgiven?""And you consider yourself engaged to BOTH John Smith and Stanley G."It sounds pretty bad, but--yes," blushed Miss Maggie."And you must love Stanley G. Fulton just exactly as well--no, a little
better, than you did John Smith.""I'll--try to--if he's as lovable."Miss Maggie's head was at a saucy
tilt."He'll try to be; but--it won't be all play, you know, for you.You've
got to tell him what to do with those twenty millions.By the way, what
WILL you do with them?"Fulton, you HAVE got--And
I forgot all about--those twenty millions."They belong to
Fulton, if you please.Furthermore, CAN'T you call me anything but that
abominable 'Mr.You might--er--abbreviate
it to--er--' Stan,' now.""Perhaps so--but I shan't," laughed Miss Maggie,--"not yet.You may be
thankful I have wits enough left to call you anything--after becoming
engaged to two men all at once.""And with having the responsibility of spending twenty millions, too.""Oh, we can do so much with that money!Why, only think what is
needed right HERE--better milk for the babies, and a community house,
and the streets cleaner, and a new carpet for the church, and a new
hospital with--"

"But, see here, aren't you going to spend some of that money on
yourself?"I'm going to Egypt, and China, and
Japan--with you, of course; and books--oh, you never saw such a lot of
books as I shall buy.And--oh, I'll spend heaps on just my selfish
self--you see if I don't!But, first,--oh, there are so many things
that I've so wanted to do, and it's just come over me this minute that
NOW I can do them!And you KNOW how Hillerton needs a new hospital.""And I want to build a store
and run it so the girls can LIVE, and a factory, too, and decent homes
for the workmen, and a big market, where they can get their food at
cost; and there's the playground for the children, and--"

But Mr.Smith was laughing, and lifting both hands in mock despair."Look here," he challenged, "I THOUGHT you were marrying ME, but--ARE
you marrying me or that confounded money?""Yes, I know; but you see--" She stopped short.Suddenly she laughed again, and threw into his eyes a look so merry, so
whimsical, so altogether challenging, that he demanded:--

"Well, what is it now?""Oh, it's so good, I have--half a mind to tell you."Miss Maggie had left the sofa, and was standing, as if half-poised for
flight, midway to the door."I think--yes, I will tell you," she nodded, her cheeks very pink; "but
I wanted to be--over here to tell it."Do you remember those letters I got awhile ago,
and the call from the Boston; lawyer, that I--I wouldn't tell you
about?""Well; you know you--you thought they--they had something to do
with--my money; that I--I'd lost some.""Well, they--they did have something to do--with money.""Oh, why wouldn't you tell me
then--and let me help you some way?"She shook her head nervously and backed nearer the door.If you don't--I won't tell you.""Well, as I said, it did have something to do--with my money; but just
now, when you asked me if I--I was marrying you or your money--"

"But I was in fun--you know I was in fun!""Oh, yes, I knew that," nodded Miss Maggie."But it--it made me laugh
and remember--the letters.You see, they weren't as you thought.They
didn't tell me of--of money lost.That father's Cousin George in Alaska had died and left me--fifty
thousand dollars.""But, my dear woman, why in Heaven's name wouldn't you tell me that?""You see, I thought
you were poor--very poor, and I--I wouldn't even own up to it myself,
but I knew, in my heart, that I was afraid, if you heard I had this
money, you wouldn't--you wouldn't--ask me to--to--"

She was blushing so adorably now that the man understood and leaped to
his feet."Maggie, you--darling!"But the door had shut--Miss Maggie had fled.CHAPTER XXIV

THAT MISERABLE MONEY


In the evening, after the Martin girls had gone to their rooms, Miss
Maggie and Mr."Of course," he began with a sigh, "I'm really not out of the woods at
all.Blissfully happy as I am, I'm really deeper in the woods than
ever, for now I've got you there with me, to look out for.However
successfully John Smith might dematerialize into nothingness--Maggie
Duff can't.""No, I know she can't," admitted Miss Maggie soberly."Yet if she marries John Smith she'll have to--and if she doesn't marry
him, how's Stanley G. Fulton going to do his courting?Smith, you'll HAVE to tell them--who you are.You'll have to tell them
right away."The man made a playfully wry face."I shall be glad," he observed, "when I shan't have to be held off at
the end of a 'Mr.'!However, we'll let that pass--until we settle the
other matter.Have you given any thought as to HOW I'm going to tell
Cousin Frank and Cousin James and Cousin Flora that I am Stanley G."No--except that you must do it," she answered decidedly."I don't
think you ought to deceive them another minute--not another minute.""And had you thought--as to
what would happen when I did tell them?""Why, n-no, not particularly, except that--that they naturally wouldn't
like it, at first, and that you'd have to explain--just as you did to
me--why you did it.""And do you think they'll like it any better--when I do explain?Miss Maggie meditated; then, a little tremulously she drew in her
breath."Why, you'd have to tell them that--that you did it for a test,
wouldn't you?""And they'd know--they couldn't help knowing--that they had failed to
meet it adequately."And would that help matters any--make things any happier, all
around?""No--oh, no," she frowned despairingly."Would it do anybody any REAL good, now?"N-no," she admitted reluctantly, "except that--that you'd be doing
right."And another thing--aside from the
mortification, dismay, and anger of my good cousins, have you thought
what I'd be bringing on you?"In less than half a dozen hours after the Blaisdells knew that
Mr.John Smith was Stanley G. Fulton, Hillerton would know it.And in
less than half a dozen more hours, Boston, New York, Chicago,--to say
nothing of a dozen lesser cities,--would know it--if there didn't
happen to be anything bigger on foot.Headlines an inch high would
proclaim the discovery of the missing Stanley G. Fulton, and the fine
print below would tell everything that happened, and a great deal that
didn't happen, in the carrying-out of the eccentric multi-millionaire's
extraordinary scheme of testing his relatives with a hundred thousand
dollars apiece to find a suitable heir.Your picture would adorn the
front page of the yellowest of yellow journals, and--"

"MY picture!"Oh, yes, yes," smiled the man imperturbably.Aren't you the affianced bride of Mr.I can see them
now: 'In Search of an Heir and Finds a Wife.'--'Charming Miss Maggie
Duff Falls in Love with Plain John Smith,' and--"

"Oh, no, no," moaned Miss Maggie, shrinking back as if already the
lurid headlines were staring her in the face."Oh, well, it might not be so bad as that, of course.Undoubtedly there are elements for a pretty good story in the
case, and some man, with nothing more important to write up, is bound
to make the most of it somewhere.There's
sure to be unpleasant publicity, my dear, if the truth once leaks out.""But what--what HAD you planned to do?""Well, I HAD planned something like this: pretty quick, now, Mr.Smith
was to announce the completion of his Blaisdell data, and, with
properly grateful farewells, take his departure from Hillerton.There he would go inland on some sort of a
simple expedition with a few native guides and carriers, but no other
companion.Somewhere in the wilderness he would shed his beard and his
name, and would emerge in his proper person of Stanley G. Fulton and
promptly take passage for the States.Of course, upon the arrival in
Chicago of Mr.Stanley G. Fulton, there would be a slight flurry at his
appearance, and a few references to the hundred-thousand-dollar gifts
to the Eastern relatives, and sundry speculations as to the why and how
of the exploring trip.There would be various rumors and alleged
interviews; but Mr.Stanley G. Fulton never was noted for his
communicativeness, and, after a very short time, the whole thing would
be dismissed as probably another of the gentleman's well-known
eccentricities."Oh, I see," murmured Miss Maggie, in very evident relief."That would
be better--in some ways; only it does seem terrible not to--to tell
them who you are.""But we have just proved that to do that wouldn't bring happiness
anywhere, and would bring misery everywhere, haven't we?""Then why do it?--particularly as by not doing it I am not defrauding
anybody in the least.No; that part isn't worrying me a bit now--but
there is one point that does worry me very much."My scheme gets Stanley G. Fulton back to life and Chicago
very nicely; but it doesn't get Maggie Duff there worth a cent!Maggie
Duff can't marry Mr.John Smith in Hillerton and arrive in Chicago as
the wife of Stanley G. Fulton, can she?""N-no, but he--he can come back and get her--if he wants her."(Miss Maggie blushed all the more at the
method and the fervor of Mr.Smith, smiling at Miss
Maggie's hurried efforts to smooth her ruffled hair.He'd look altogether too much like--like Mr."But your beard will be gone--I wonder how I shall like you without a
beard."Smith laughed and threw up his hands with a doleful shrug."That's what comes of courting as one man and marrying as another," he
groaned.Then, sternly: "I'll warn you right now, Maggie Duff, that
Stanley G. Fulton is going to be awfully jealous of John Smith if you
don't look out.""He should have thought of that before," retorted Miss Maggie, her eyes
mischievous."But, tell me, wouldn't you EVER dare to come--in your
proper person?""Never!--or, at least, not for some time.The beard would be gone, to
be sure; but there'd be all the rest to tattle--eyes, voice, size,
manner, walk--everything; and smoked glasses couldn't cover all that,
you know.They'd only result
in making me look more like John Smith than ever.John Smith, you
remember, wore smoked glasses for some time to hide Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton from the ubiquitous reporter.Stanley G. Fulton can't
come to Hillerton.So, as Mahomet can't go to the mountain, the
mountain must come to Mahomet."Miss Maggie's eyes were growing dangerously mutinous."That you will have to come to Chicago--yes.""I love you with your head tilted that way."(Miss Maggie promptly
tilted it the other.)"Or that, either, for that matter," continued Mr."However, speaking of courting--Mr.Fulton will do
that, all right, and endeavor to leave nothing lacking, either as to
quantity or quality.Haven't you got some friend that you can visit?"Miss Maggie's answer was prompt and emphatic--too prompt and too
emphatic for unquestioning acceptance."Oh, yes, you have," asserted the man cheerfully."I don't know her
name--but she's there.She's Waving a red flag from your face this
minute!Well, turn your head away, if you like--if you can
listen better that way," he went on tranquilly paying no attention to
her little gasp."Well, all you have to do is to write the lady you're
coming, and go.Stanley G. Fulton will find
a way to meet her.Then he'll call and meet
you--and be so pleased to see you!There'll be a
regular whirlwind courtship then--calls, dinners, theaters, candy,
books, flowers!You'll be immensely surprised, of course, but you'll accept.Then we'll
get married," he finished with a deep sigh of satisfaction."Say, CAN'T you call me anything--" he began wrathfully, but
interrupted himself."However, it's better that you don't, after all.But you wait
till you meet Mr.Now, what's her name,
and where does she live?"Miss Maggie laughed in spite of herself, as she said severely: "Her
name, indeed!Stanley G. Fulton is so in the habit of
having his own way that he forgets he is still Mr.However,
there IS an old schoolmate," she acknowledged demurely.Now, write her at once, and tell her you're
coming.""But she--she may not be there."I think you'd
better plan to go pretty soon after I go to South America.Stanley G. Fulton arrives in Chicago and can write
the news back here to Hillerton.Oh, they'll get it in the papers, in
time, of course; but I think it had better come from you first.You
see--the reappearance on this earth of Mr.Stanley G. Fulton is going
to be of--of some moment to them, you know.Hattie, for
instance, who is counting on the rest of the money next November.""Yes, I know, it will mean a good deal to them, of course.Still, I
don't believe Hattie is really expecting the money.At any rate, she
hasn't said anything about it very lately--perhaps because she's been
too busy bemoaning the pass the present money has brought them to.""No, no--I didn't mean to bring that up," apologized Miss Maggie
quickly, with an apprehensive glance into his face."And it wasn't
miserable money a bit!Besides, Hattie has--has learned her lesson, I'm
sure, and she'll do altogether differently in the new home.Smith, am I never to--to come back here?"Indeed we can--some time, by and by, when all this has blown over, and
they've forgotten how Mr.Meanwhile, you can come alone--a VERY little.I shan't let you leave me
very much.But I understand; you'll have to come to see your friends.Besides, there are all those playgrounds for the babies and cleaner
milk for the streets, and--"

"Cleaner milk for the streets, indeed!"Oh, yes, it WAS the milk for the babies, wasn't it?""Well, however that may be you'll have to come back to
superintend all those things you've been wanting to do so long.But"--his face grew a little wistful--"you don't want to spend too much
time here.You know--Chicago has a few babies that need cleaner milk."Her face grew softly luminous as it had grown
earlier in the afternoon."So you can bestow some of your charity there; and--"

"It isn't charity," she interrupted with suddenly flashing eyes."Oh,
how I hate that word--the way it's used, I mean.Of course, the real
charity means love.I suppose it was LOVE that made John
Daly give one hundred dollars to the Pension Fund Fair--after he'd
jewed it out of those poor girls behind his counters!Morse
went around everywhere telling how kind dear Mr.Daly was to give so
much to charity!Nobody wants charity--except a few lazy
rascals like those beggars of Flora's!And
if half the world gave the other half its rights there wouldn't BE any
charity, I believe."Smith
held up both hands in mock terror."I shall be petitioning her for my
bread and butter, yet!"Smith, when I think of all that
money"--her eyes began to shine again--"and of what we can do with it,
I--I just can't believe it's so!""But you aren't expecting that twenty millions are going to right all
the wrongs in the world, are you?""No, oh, no; but we can help SOME that we know about.But it isn't that
I just want to GIVE, you know.We must get behind things--to the
causes.We must--"

"We must make the Mr.Dalys pay more to their girls before they pay
anything to pension funds, eh?"Smith, as Miss Maggie came
to a breathless pause."Oh, can't you SEE what we can
do--with that twenty million dollars?"Smith, his gaze on Miss Maggie's flushed cheeks and shining eyes,
smiled tenderly."I see--that I'm being married for my money--after all!"sniffed Miss Maggie, so altogether bewitchingly that Mr.Smith
gave her a rapturous kiss.JOHN SMITH


Early in July Mr.He made a
farewell call upon each of the Blaisdell families, and thanked them
heartily for all their kindness in assisting him with his Blaisdell
book.The Blaisdells, one and all, said they were very sorry to have him go.Miss Flora frankly wiped her eyes, and told Mr.Smith she could never,
never thank him enough for what he had done for her.Mellicent, too,
with shy eyes averted, told him she should never forget what he had
done for her--and for Donald.James and Flora and Frank--and even Jane!--said that they would like to
have one of the Blaisdell books, when they were published, to hand down
in the family.Flora took out her purse and said that she would pay for
hers now; but Mr.Smith hastily, and with some evident embarrassment,
refused the money, saying that he could not tell yet what the price of
the book would be.All the Blaisdells, except Frank, Fred, and Bessie, went to the station
to see Mr.They told him he was
just like one of the family, anyway, and they declared they hoped he
would come back soon.Frank telephoned him that he would have gone,
too, if he had not had so much to do at the store.Smith seemed pleased at all this attention--he seemed, indeed,
quite touched; but he seemed also embarrassed--in fact, he seemed often
embarrassed during those last few days at Hillerton.Miss Maggie Duff did not go to the station to see Mr.Miss
Flora, on her way home, stopped at the Duff cottage and reproached Miss
Maggie for the delinquency."All the rest of us did,
'most."You're Blaisdells--but I'm not, you know.""You're just as good as one, Maggie Duff!Besides, hasn't that man
boarded here for over a year, and paid you good money, too?""Why, y-yes, of course.""Well, then, I don't think it would have hurt you any to show him this
last little attention.He'll think you don't like him, or--or are mad
about something, when all the rest of us went.""Well, then, if--Why, Maggie Duff, you're BLUSHING!"she broke off,
peering into Miss Maggie's face in a way that did not tend to lessen
the unmistakable color that was creeping to her forehead.I declare, if you were twenty years younger, and I didn't
know better, I should say that--" She stopped abruptly, then plunged
on, her countenance suddenly alight with a new idea."NOW I know why
you didn't go to the station, Maggie Duff!That man proposed to you,
and you refused him!"gasped Miss Maggie, her face scarlet.Hattie always said it would be a match--from
the very first, when he came here to your house."gasped Miss Maggie again, looking about her very much as if
she were meditating flight."Well, she did--but I didn't believe it.You refused
him--now, didn't you?"Miss Maggie caught her breath a little convulsively."Well, I suppose you didn't,
then, if you say so.And I don't need to ask if you accepted him.You
didn't, of course, or you'd have been there to see him off.And he
wouldn't have gone then, anyway, probably.So he didn't ask you, I
suppose.Well, I never did believe, like Hattie did, that--"

"Flora," interrupted Miss Maggie desperately, "WILL you stop talking in
that absurd way?Listen, I did not care to go to the station to-day.I'm going to see my old classmate, Nellie
Maynard--Mrs.It's lovely, of course, only--only I--I'm so
surprised!"All the more reason why I should, then.It's time I did," smiled Miss
Maggie.And I do hope you can DO it, and
that it won't peter out at the last minute, same's most of your good
times do.And you've had such a hard life--and your
boarder leaving, too!That'll make a lot of difference in your
pocketbook, won't it?But, Maggie, you'll have to have some new
clothes."I've got to have--oh,
lots of things."And, Maggie,"--Miss Flora's face grew
eager,--"please, PLEASE, won't you let me help you a little--about
those clothes?And get some nice ones--some real nice ones, for once.Please, Maggie, there's a good girl!""Thank you, no, dear," refused Miss Maggie, shaking her head with a
smile."But I appreciate your kindness just the same--indeed, I do!""If you wouldn't be so horrid proud," pouted Miss Flora.I was going to tell
you soon, anyway, and I'll tell it now.I HAVE money, dear,--lots of it
now."Father's Cousin George died two months ago.""Yes; and to father's daughter he left--fifty thousand dollars."But he loved father, you know, years ago,
and father loved him.""But had you ever heard from him--late years?"Father was very angry because he went to Alaska in the first
place, you know, and they haven't ever written very often."They sent me a thousand--just for pin money, they
said.The lawyer's written several times, and he's been here once.I
believe it's all to come next month.""Oh, I'm so glad, Maggie," breathed Flora.I don't know
of anybody I'd rather see take a little comfort in life than you!"At the door, fifteen minutes later, Miss Flora said again how glad she
was; but she added wistfully:--

"I'm sure I don't know, though, what I'm going to do all summer without
you.Just think how lonesome we'll be--you gone to Chicago, Hattie and
Jim and all their family moved to Plainville, and even Mr.And I think we're going to miss Mr."Indeed, I do think he was a very nice man!""Now, Flora, I shall want you to go shopping with me lots.And Miss Flora, eagerly entering into Miss Maggie's discussion of
frills and flounces, failed to notice that Miss Maggie had dropped the
subject of Mr.Hillerton had much to talk about during those summer days.Smith's
going had created a mild discussion--the "ancestor feller" was well
known and well liked in the town.But even his departure did not arouse
the interest that was bestowed upon the removal of the James Blaisdells
to Plainville; and this, in turn, did not cause so great an excitement
as did the news that Miss Maggie Duff had inherited fifty thousand
dollars and had gone to Chicago to spend it.And the fact that nearly
all who heard this promptly declared that they hoped she WOULD spend a
good share of it--in Chicago, or elsewhere--on herself, showed pretty
well just where Miss Maggie Duff stood in the hearts of Hillerton.It was early in September that Miss Flora had the letter from Miss
Maggie.Not but that she had received letters from Miss Maggie before,
but that the contents of this one made it at once, to all the
Blaisdells, "the letter."Miss Flora began to read it, gave a little cry, and sprang to her feet.Standing, her breath suspended, she finished it.Five minutes later,
gloves half on and hat askew, she was hurrying across the common to her
brother Frank's home."Jane, Jane," she panted, as soon as she found her sister-in-law."I've
had a letter from Maggie.She's just been living on having that money.And us, with all we've
lost, too!But, then, maybe we wouldn't have got it, anyway.And I never thought to bring it," ejaculated Miss Flora
vexedly.She said it would be in all the Eastern papers right away,
of course, but she wanted to tell us first, so we wouldn't be so
surprised.Walked into his lawyer's office without a
telegram, or anything.Tyndall
brought home the news that night in an 'Extra'; but that's all it
told--just that Mr.Stanley G. Fulton, the multi-millionaire who
disappeared nearly two years ago on an exploring trip to South America,
had come back alive and well.Then it told all about the two letters he
left, and the money he left to us, and all that, Maggie said; and it
talked a lot about how lucky it was that he got back just in time
before the other letter had to be opened next November.But it didn't
say any more about his trip, or anything.The morning papers will have
more, Maggie said, probably.""Yes, of course, of course," nodded Jane, rolling the corner of her
upper apron nervously.(Since the forty-thousand-dollar loss Jane had
gone back to her old habit of wearing two aprons.)"Where DO you
suppose he's been all this time?"Maggie said it wasn't known--that the paper didn't say.It was an
'Extra' anyway, and it just got in the bare news of his return.Besides, Maggie'll
write again about it, I'm sure.I'm so glad she's having
such a good time!""Yes, of course, of course," nodded Jane again nervously."Say, Flora,
I wonder--do you suppose WE'LL ever hear from him?He left us all that
money--he knows that, of course.He can't ask for it back--the lawyer
said he couldn't do that!But, I wonder--do you
suppose we ought to write him and--and thank him?"exclaimed Miss Flora, aghast.I'd be
scared to death to do such a thing as that.Oh, you don't think we've
got to do THAT?"We'd want to do what was right and proper, of course.But I don't see--" She paused helplessly.Miss Flora gave a sudden hysterical little laugh."Well, I don't see how we're going to find out what's proper, in this
case," she giggled."We can't write to a magazine, same as I did when I
wanted to know how to answer invitations and fix my knives and forks on
the table.We CAN'T write to them, 'cause nothing like this ever
happened before, and they wouldn't know what to say.How'd we look
writing, 'Please, dear Editor, when a man wills you a hundred thousand
dollars and then comes to life again, is it proper or not proper to
write and thank him?'They'd think we was crazy, and they'd have reason
to!For my part, I--"

The telephone bell rang sharply, and Jane rose to answer it.When she came back she was even more excited.she questioned, as Miss
Flora got hastily to her feet.I left everything just as it was and ran, when I got the
letter.I'll get a paper myself on the way home.I'm going to call up
Hattie, too, on the long distance.My, it's'most as exciting as it was
when it first came,--the money, I mean,--isn't it?"panted Miss Flora
as she hurried away.The Blaisdells bought many papers during the next few days.But even by
the time that the Stanley G. Fulton sensation had dwindled to a short
paragraph in an obscure corner of a middle page, they (and the public
in general) were really little the wiser, except for these bare facts:--

Stanley G. Fulton had arrived at a South American hotel, from the
interior, had registered as S. Fulton, frankly to avoid publicity, and
had taken immediate passage to New York.Arriving at New York, still to
avoid publicity, he had not telegraphed his attorneys, but had taken
the sleeper for Chicago, and had fortunately not met any one who
recognized him until his arrival in that city.He had brought home
several fine specimens of Incan textiles and potteries: and he declared
that he had had a very enjoyable and profitable trip.He did not care to talk of his experiences, he said.For a time, of course, his return was made much of.Fake interviews and
rumors of threatened death and disaster in impenetrable jungles made
frequent appearance; but in an incredibly short time the flame of
interest died from want of fuel to feed upon; and, as Mr.Stanley G.
Fulton himself had once predicted, the matter was soon dismissed as
merely another of the multi-millionaire's well-known eccentricities.All of this the Blaisdells heard from Miss Maggie in addition to seeing
it in the newspapers.But very soon, from Miss Maggie, they began to
learn more.Before a fortnight had passed, Miss Flora received another
letter from Chicago that sent her flying as before to her sister-in-law."Jane, Jane, Maggie's MET HIM!"she cried, breathlessly bursting into
the kitchen where Jane was paring the apples that she would not trust
to the maid's more wasteful knife.With a hasty twirl of a now reckless knife, Jane finished the
last apple, set the pan on the table before the maid, and hurried her
visitor into the living-room."Now, tell me quick--what did she say?"Yes--yes--everything," nodded Miss Flora, sinking into a chair."She
liked him real well, she said and he knows all about that she belongs
to us.Oh, I hope she didn't
tell him about--Fred!""And that awful gold-mine stock," moaned Jane."But she wouldn't--I
know she wouldn't!""Of course she wouldn't," cried Miss Flora."'Tisn't like Maggie one
bit!She'd only tell the nice things, I'm sure.And, of course, she'd
tell him how pleased we were with the money!"And to think she's met him--really met
him!"She turned an excited face to her
daughter, who had just entered the room.Aunt
Flora's just had a letter from Aunt Maggie, and she's met Mr.Fulton--actually TALKED with him!"Yes, he's real nice, your Aunt
Maggie says, and she likes him very much."Tyndall brought him home
one night and introduced him to his wife and Maggie; and since then
he's been very nice to them.He's taken them out in his automobile, and
taken them to the theater twice.""That's because she belongs to us, of course," nodded Jane wisely."Yes, I suppose so," agreed Flora."And I think it's very kind of him.""_I_ think he does it because he
WANTS to.I'll warrant she's
nicer and sweeter and--and, yes, PRETTIER than lots of those old
Chicago women.Aunt Maggie looked positively HANDSOME that day she left
here last July.Probably he LIKES
to take her to places.Anyhow, I'm glad she's having one good time
before she dies.""Yes, so am I, my dear."I only wish he'd marry her and--and give her a good time all her
life," avowed Mellicent, lifting her chin.She's good enough for him," bridled Mellicent."Aunt
Maggie's good enough for anybody!""Maggie's a saint--if
ever there was one.""Yes, but I shouldn't call her a MARRYING saint," smiled Jane."Well, I don't know about that," frowned Miss Flora thoughtfully."Hattie always declared there'd be a match between her and Mr."Well, then, I
shall stick to my original statement that Maggie Duff is a saint, all
right, but not a marrying one--unless some one marries her now for her
money, of course.""As if Aunt Maggie'd stand for that!""Besides, she
wouldn't have to!Aunt Maggie's good enough to be married for herself.""There, there, child, just because you are a love-sick little piece of
romance just now, you needn't think everybody else is," her mother
reproved her a little sharply.But Mellicent only laughed merrily as she disappeared into her own room.Smith, I wonder where he is, and if he'll ever come
back here," mused Miss Flora, aloud.He was a very
nice man, and I liked him.""Goodness, Flora, YOU aren't, getting romantic, too, are you?"teased
her sister-in-law.ejaculated Miss Flora sharply, buttoning up her coat."I'm no more romantic than--than poor Maggie herself is!"Two weeks later, to a day, came Miss Maggie's letter announcing her
engagement to Mr.Stanley G. Fulton, and saying that she was to be
married in Chicago before Christmas.CHAPTER XXVI

REENTER MR.STANLEY G. FULTON


In the library of Mrs.Stanley G.
Fulton was impatiently awaiting the appearance of Miss Maggie Duff.In
a minute she came in, looking charmingly youthful in her new,
well-fitting frock.The man, quickly on his feet at her entrance, gave her a lover's ardent
kiss; but almost instantly he held her off at arms' length."Why, dearest, what's the matter?""You look as if--if something had happened--not exactly a bad
something, but--What is it?""That's one of the very nicest things about you, Mr.Stanley-G.-Fulton-John-Smith," she sighed, nestling comfortably into
the curve of his arm, as they sat down on the divan;--"that you NOTICE
things so.And it seems so good to me to have somebody--NOTICE."And to think of all these years I've wasted!""Oh, but I shan't be lonely any more now.And, listen--I'll tell you
what made me look so funny.You know I
wrote them--about my coming marriage.""I believe--I'll let you read the letter for yourself, Stanley.It
tells some things, toward the end that I think you'll like to know,"
she said, a little hesitatingly, as she held out the letter she had
brought into the room with her.I'd like to read it," cried Fulton, whisking the closely written
sheets from the envelope.MY DEAR MAGGIE (Flora had written): Well, mercy me, you have given us a
surprise this time, and no mistake!Yet we're all real glad, Maggie,
and we hope you'll be awfully happy.You've had such an awfully hard time all your life!Well, when your letter came, we were just going out to Jim's for an
old-fashioned Thanksgiving dinner, so I took it along with me and read
it to them all.I kept it till we were all together, too, though I most
bursted with the news all the way out.Well, you ought to have heard their tongues wag!They were all struck
dumb first, for a minute, all except Mellicent.She spoke up the very
first thing, and clapped her hands.I knew Aunt Maggie was good
enough for anybody!"To explain that I'll have to go back a little.We were talking one day
about you--Jane and Mellicent and me--and we said you were a saint,
only not a marrying saint.But Mellicent thought you were, and it seems
she was right.Oh, of course, we'd all thought once Mr.Smith might
take a fancy to you, but we never dreamed of such a thing as this--Mr.Sakes alive--I can hardly sense it yet!Jane, for a minute, forgot how rich he was, and spoke right up real
quick--"It's for her money, of course.I KNEW some one would marry her
for that fifty thousand dollars!"But she laughed then, right off, with
the rest of us, at the idea of a man worth twenty millions marrying
ANYBODY for fifty thousand dollars.Benny says there ain't any man alive good enough for his Aunt Maggie,
so if Mr.Fulton gets to being too highheaded sometimes, you can tell
him what Benny says.But we're all real pleased, honestly, Maggie, and of course we're
terribly excited.We're so sorry you're going to be married out there
in Chicago.Why can't you make him come to Hillerton?Jane says she'd
be glad to make a real nice wedding for you--and when Jane says a thing
like that, you can know how much she's really saying, for Jane's
feeling awfully poor these days, since they lost all that money, you
know.Fulton, too--"Cousin Stanley," as Hattie
always calls him.Please give him our congratulations--but there, that
sounds funny, doesn't it?(But the etiquette editors in the magazines
say we must always give best wishes to the bride and congratulations to
the groom.)Only it seems funny here, to congratulate that rich Mr.I didn't mean it that way, Maggie.I
declare, if that sentence wasn't 'way in the middle of this third page,
and so awfully hard for me to write, anyway, I'd tear up this sheet and
begin another.But, after all, you'll understand, I'm sure.You KNOW we
all think the world of you, Maggie, and that I didn't mean anything
against YOU.Fulton is--is such a big man, and
all--But you know what I meant.Well, anyway, if you can't come here to be married, we hope you'll
bring him here soon so we can see him, and see you, too.We miss you
awfully, Maggie,--truly we do, especially since Jim's folks went, and
with Mr.Smith gone, too, Jane and I are real lonesome.Jim and Hattie like real well where they are.They've got a real pretty
home, and they're the biggest folks in town, so Hattie doesn't have to
worry for fear she won't live quite so fine as her neighbors--though
really I think Hattie's got over that now a good deal.That awful thing
of Fred's sobered her a lot, and taught her who her real friends were,
and that money ain't everything.Fred is doing splendidly now, just as steady as a clock.It does my
soul good to see him and his father together.And Bessie--she isn't near so disagreeable and airy as she was.Hattie
took her out of that school and put her into another where she's
getting some real learning and less society and frills and dancing.Jim
is doing well, and I think Hattie's real happy.Oh, of course, when we
first heard that Mr.Fulton had got back, I think she was kind of
disappointed.You know she always did insist we were going to have the
rest of that money if he didn't show up.But she told me just
Thanksgiving Day that she didn't know but 't was just as well, after
all, that they didn't have the money, for maybe Fred'd go wrong again,
or it would strike Benny this time.Anyhow, however much money she had,
she said, she'd never let her children spend so much again, and she'd
found out money didn't bring happiness, always, anyway.Mellicent and Donald are going to be married next summer.Donald don't
get a very big salary yet, but Mellicent says she won't mind a bit
going back to economizing again, now that for once she's had all the
chocolates and pink dresses she wanted.What a funny girl she is--but
she's a dear girl, just the same, and she's settled down real sensible
now.She and Donald are as happy as can be, and even Jane likes Donald
real well now.Jane's gone back to her tidies and aprons and skimping on everything.She says she's got to, to make up that forty thousand dollars.But she
enjoys it, I believe.Honestly, she acts'most as happy trying to save
five cents as Frank does earning it in his old place behind the
counter.And that's saying a whole lot, as you know.Jane knows very
well she doesn't have to pinch that way.They've got lots of the money
left, and Frank's business is better than ever.You complain because I don't tell you anything about myself in my
letters, but there isn't anything to tell.I am well and happy, and
I've just thought up the nicest thing to do.Mary Hicks came home from
Boston sick last September, and she's been here at my house ever since.Her own home ain't no place for a sick person, you know, with all those
children, and they're awfully poor, too.She works in a department store and was all
played out, but she's picked up wonderfully here and is going back next
week.Well, she was telling me about a girl that works with her at the same
counter, and saying how she wished she had a place like this to go to
for a rest and change, so I'm going to do it--give them one, I mean,
she and the other girls.Mary says there are a dozen girls that she
knows right there that are half-sick, but would get well in a minute if
they only had a few weeks of rest and quiet and good food.So I'm going
to take them, two at a time, so they'll be company for each other.Mary
is going to fix it up for me down there, and pick out the girls, and
she says she knows the man who owns the store will be glad to let them
off, for they are all good help, and he's been afraid he'd lose them.He'd offered them a month off, besides their vacation, but they
couldn't take it, because they didn't have any place to go or money to
pay.Of course, that part will be all right now.And I'm so glad and
excited I don't know what to do.Oh, I do hope you'll tell Mr.Fulton
some time how happy he's made me, and how perfectly splendid that
money's been for me.Well, Maggie, this is a long letter, and I must close.Tell me all
about the new clothes you are getting, and I hope you will get a lot.Lovingly yours,

FLORA.Maggie Duff, for pity's sake, never, never tell that man
that I ever went into mourning for him and put flowers before his
picture.Fulton folded the letter and handed
it back to Miss Maggie."I didn't feel that I was betraying confidences--under the
circumstances," murmured Miss Maggie."And there was a good deal in the letter that I DID want you to see,"
added Miss Maggie."Hm-m; the congratulations, for one thing, of course," twinkled the
man."I wanted you to see how really, in the end, that money was not doing
so much harm, after all," asserted Miss Maggie, with some dignity,
shaking her head at him reprovingly."I thought you'd be GLAD, sir!"I'm so glad that, when I come to make my will now, I
shouldn't wonder if I remembered them all again--a little--that is, if
I have anything left to will," he teased shamelessly."Oh, by the way,
that makes me think.I've just been putting up a monument to John
Smith.""But, my dear Maggie, something was due the man," maintained Fulton,
reaching for a small flat parcel near him and placing it in Miss
Maggie's hands."But--oh, Stanley, how could you?"she shivered, her eyes on the words
the millionaire had penciled on the brown paper covering of the parcel.With obvious reluctance Miss Maggie loosened the paper covers and
peered within.In her hands lay a handsome brown leather volume with gold letters,
reading:--

     The Blaisdell Family
           By
        John Smith

"And you--did that?"I shall send a copy each to Frank and Jim and Miss Flora, of
course.Poor
man, it's the least I can do for him--and the most--unless--" He
hesitated with an unmistakable look of embarrassment."Well, unless--I let you take me to Hillerton one of these days and see
if--if Stanley G. Fulton, with your gracious help, can make peace for
John Smith with those--er--cousins of mine.You see, I still feel
confoundedly like that small boy at the keyhole, and I'd like--to open
that door!And, oh, Stanley, it's the one thing needed
to make me perfectly happy," she sighed blissfully.THE END









End of Project Gutenberg's Oh, Money!"Dear me, tink of mudder wanting to look at
a big u'gy t'ing like fadder, when she could look at a 'itty witty t'ing
like dis," and he rose and crossed to the crib where he deposited the
small creature with yet more gurgling and endearing.Zoie's dreams of rapture at Alfred's home coming had not included such
divided attention as he was now showing her and she was growing more and
more desperate at the turn affairs had taken.She resolved to put a stop
to his nonsense and to make him realise that she and no one else was the
lode star of his existence.She beckoned to Aggie to get out of the
room and to leave her a clear field and as soon as her friend had gone
quietly into the next room, she called impatiently to Alfred who was
still cooing rapturously over the young stranger.Finding Alfred deaf
to her first entreaty, Zoie shut her lips hard, rearranged her pretty
head-dress, drew one fascinating little curl down over her shoulder,
reknotted the pink ribbon of her negligee, and then issued a final and
imperious order for her husband to attend her."Yes, yes, dear," answered Alfred, with a shade of impatience."I'm
coming, I'm coming."And bidding a reluctant farewell to the small
person in the crib, he crossed to her side.Zoie caught Alfred's hand and drew him down to her; he smiled
complacently."Well," he said in the patronising tone that Zoie always resented."How
is hubby's little girl?""It's about time," pouted Zoie, "that you made a little fuss over me for
a change."He stooped to kiss the eager lips, but just
as his young wife prepared to lend herself to his long delayed embrace,
his mind was distracted by an uneasy thought."Do you think that Baby
is----"

He was not permitted to finish the sentence.Zoie drew him back to her with a sharp exclamation."Think of ME for a while," she commanded."My darling," expostulated Alfred with a shade of surprise at her
vehemence.Again he stooped to
embrace her and again his mind was directed otherwise."I wonder if Baby
is warm enough," he said and attempted to rise."Wonder about ME for a while," snapped Zoie, clinging to him
determinedly.Was it possible there was
anything besides Baby worth wondering about?Whether there was or not,
Zoie was no longer to be resisted and with a last regretful look at the
crib, he resigned himself to giving his entire attention to his spoiled
young wife.Gratified by her hard-won conquest, Zoie now settled herself in Alfred's
arms."You haven't told me what you did all the time that you were away," she
reminded him."Oh, there was plenty to do," answered Alfred."That would be telling," laughed Alfred, as he pinched her small pink
ear."I wish to be 'told,'" declared Zoie; "I don't suppose you realise it,
but if I were to live a THOUSAND YEARS, I'd never be quite sure what you
did during those FEW MONTHS.""It was nothing that you wouldn't have been proud of," answered Alfred,
with an unconscious expansion of his chest."Do you love me as much as ever?""Behave yourself," answered Alfred, trying not to appear flattered
by the discovery that his absence had undoubtedly caused her great
uneasiness."You know I do," answered Alfred, with the diffidence of a school boy."Then kiss me," concluded Zoie, with an air of finality that left Alfred
no alternative.As a matter of fact, Alfred was no longer seeking an alternative.He was
again under the spell of his wife's adorable charms and he kissed her
not once, but many times."Foolish child," he murmured, then he laid her tenderly against the
large white pillows, remonstrating with her for being so spoiled, and
cautioning her to be a good little girl while he went again to see about
Baby.Zoie clung to his hand and feigned approaching tears."You aren't thinking of me at all?""And kisses are no
good unless you put your whole mind on them.Again Alfred stooped to humour the small importunate person who was so
jealous of his every thought, but just as his lips touched her forehead
his ear was arrested by a sound as yet new both to him and to Zoie."I don't know," answered Zoie, wondering if the cat could have got into
the room.A redoubled effort on the part of the young stranger directed their
attention in the right direction.exclaimed Alfred tragically, "it's Baby.And
with that, he rushed to the crib and clasped the small mite close to his
breast, leaving Zoie to pummel the pillows in an agony of vexation.After vain cajoling of the angry youngster, Alfred bore him excitedly to
Zoie's bedside."You'd better take him, dear," he said.To the young husband's astonishment, Zoie waved him from her in terror,
and called loudly for Aggie.But no sooner had Aggie appeared on the
scene, than a sharp whistle was heard from the pavement below.Attributing Zoie's uneasiness to a caprice of modesty, Alfred turned
from the cradle to reassure her."No one can see in way up here," he said.To Zoie's distress, the lowering of the shade was answered by a yet
shriller whistle from the street below."Was it 'up' or 'down'?"cried Zoie to Aggie in an agony of doubt, as
she tried to recall her instructions to Jimmy."I don't know," answered Aggie.Alarmed by
Zoie's increasing excitement, and thinking she was troubled merely by
a sick woman's fancy that someone might see through the window, Alfred
placed the babe quickly in its cradle and crossed to the young wife's
bed."It was up, dear," he said."Then I want it up," declared the seemingly perverse Zoie.A succession of emotional whistles set Zoie to pounding the pillows."Did I say 'up' or did I say 'down'?"moaned the half-demented Zoie,
while long whistles and short whistles, appealing whistles and impatient
whistles followed each other in quick succession."You said down, dear," persisted Alfred, now almost as distracted as his
wife."I wish you'd get out of here," she cried;
"you make me so nervous that I can't think at all.""Of course, dear," murmured Alfred, "if you wish it."And with a hurt
and perplexed expression on his face he backed quickly from the room.CHAPTER XXI

When Zoie's letter asking for the O'Flarety twin had reached that young
lady's astonished mother, Mrs.O'Flarety felt herself suddenly lifted to
a position of importance.Hardy a wantin' my little Bridget," she
exclaimed, and she began to dwell upon the romantic possibilities of
her offspring's future under the care of such a "foine stylish lady and
concluded by declaring it 'a lucky day entoirely.'"Jimmy had his misgivings about it being Bridget's "LUCKY day," but it
was not for him to delay matters by dwelling upon the eccentricities
of Zoie's character, and when Mrs.O'Flarety had deposited Bridget in
Jimmy's short arms and slipped a well filled nursing bottle into his
overcoat pocket, he took his leave hastily, lest the excited woman add
Bridget's twin to her willing offering.Once out of sight of the elated mother, Jimmy thrust the defenceless
Bridget within the folds of his already snug ulster, buttoned the
garment in such places as it would meet, and made for the taxi which,
owing to the upset condition of the street, he had been obliged to
abandon at the corner.Whether the driver had obtained a more promising "fare" or been run
in by the police, Jimmy never knew.At any rate it was in vain that he
looked for his vehicle.So intense was the cold that it was impossible
to wait for a chance taxi; furthermore, the meanness of the district
made it extremely unlikely that one would appear, and glancing guiltily
behind him to make sure that no one was taking cognisance of his strange
exploit, Jimmy began picking his way along dark lanes and avoiding the
lighted thoroughfare on which the "Sherwood" was situated, until he was
within a block of his destination.Panting with haste and excitement, he eventually gained courage to
dash through a side street that brought him within a few doors of the
"Sherwood."Again glancing behind him, he turned the well lighted corner
and arrived beneath Zoie's window to find one shade up and one down.In
his perplexity he emitted a faint whistle.Immediately he saw the other
shade lowered.Uncertain as to what arrangement he had actually made
with Zoie, he ventured a second whistle.The result was a hysterical
running up and down of the shade which left him utterly bewildered as to
what disposition he was supposed to make of the wobbly bit of humanity
pressed against his shirt front.Reaching over his artificially curved figure to grasp a bit of white
that trailed below his coat, he looked up to see a passing policeman
eyeing him suspiciously."Ye-yes," mumbled Jimmy with affected nonchalence and he knocked the
heels of his boots together in order to keep his teeth from chattering."It's a fi-fine ni-night for air," he stuttered.said the policeman, and to Jimmy's horror, he saw the fellow's
eyes fix themselves on the bit of white."Go-good-night," stammered Jimmy hurriedly, and trying to assume an
easy stride in spite of the uncomfortable addition to his already rotund
figure, he slipped into the hotel, where avoiding the lighted elevator,
he laboured quickly, up the stairs.At the very moment when Zoie was driving Alfred in consternation from
the room, Jimmy entered it uninvited."Get out," was the inhospitable greeting received simultaneously from
Zoie and Aggie, and without waiting for further instructions he "got."Fortunately for all concerned, Alfred, who was at the same moment
departing by way of the bedroom door, did not look behind him; but it
was some minutes before Aggie who had followed Jimmy into the hall could
persuade him to return.After repeated and insistent signals both from Aggie and Zoie, Jimmy's
round red face appeared cautiously around the frame of the door.It bore
unmistakable indications of apoplexy.But the eyes of the women were not
upon Jimmy's face, they too had caught sight of the bit of white that
hung below his coat, and dragging him quickly into the room and closing
the door, Aggie proceeded without inquiry or thanks to unbutton his coat
and to take from beneath it the small object for which she and Zoie had
been eagerly waiting.sighed Zoie, as she saw Aggie bearing the latest
acquisition to Alfred's rapidly increasing family safely toward the
crib.Suddenly remembering something in his right hand coat pocket, Jimmy
called to Aggie, who turned to him and waited expectantly.After
characteristic fumbling, he produced a well filled nursing bottle."For HER," grunted Jimmy, and he nodded toward the bundle in Aggie's
arms.cried Zoie and Aggie in chorus.Zoie shut her lips hard and gazed
at him with contempt."I might have known you'd get the wrong kind," she said.What Jimmy thought about the ingratitude of woman was not to be
expressed in language.He controlled himself as well as he could and
merely LOOKED the things that he would like to have said."Well, it can't be helped now," decided the philosophic Aggie; "here,
Jimmy," she said, "you hold 'HER' a minute and I'll get you the other
one."Placing the small creature in Jimmy's protesting arms, Aggie turned
toward the cradle to make the proposed exchange when she was startled by
the unexpected return of Alfred.Thanks to the ample folds of Jimmy's ulster, he was able to effectually
conceal his charge and he started quickly toward the hall, but in making
the necessary detour around the couch he failed to reach the door before
Alfred, who had chosen a more direct way."Hold on, Jimmy," exclaimed Alfred good-naturedly, and he laid a
detaining hand on his friend's shoulder."I'll be back," stammered Jimmy weakly, edging his way toward the door,
and contriving to keep his back toward Alfred."Wait a minute," said Alfred jovially, as he let his hand slip onto
Jimmy's arm, "you haven't told me the news yet.""I'll tell you later," mumbled Jimmy, still trying to escape.But
Alfred's eye had fallen upon a bit of white flannel dangling below
the bottom of Jimmy's ulster, it travelled upward to Jimmy's unusually
rotund figure.he demanded to know, as he pointed toward the
centre button of Jimmy's overcoat.echoed Jimmy vapidly, glancing at the button in question, "why,
that's just a little----" There was a faint wail from the depths of
the ulster.Jimmy began to caper about with elephantine tread."Oochie,
coochie, oochie," he called excitedly.cried the anxious father, "it's my boy."And with that
he pounced upon Jimmy, threw wide his ulster and snatched from his arms
Jimmy's latest contribution to Zoie's scheme of things.As Aggie had previously remarked, all young babies look very much alike,
and to the inexperienced eye of this new and overwrought father, there
was no difference between the infant that he now pressed to his breast,
and the one that, unsuspected by him, lay peacefully dozing in the crib,
not ten feet from him.He gazed at the face of the newcomer with the
same ecstasy that he had felt in the possession of her predecessor.But
Zoie and Aggie were looking at each other with something quite different
from ecstasy."My boy," exclaimed Alfred, with deep emotion, as he clasped the tiny
creature to his breast."What were you doing
with my baby?""I--I was just taking him out for a little walk!""You just try," threatened Alfred, and he towered over the intimidated
Jimmy.Jimmy was of the opinion that he must be crazy or he would never have
found himself in such a predicament as this, but the anxious faces of
Zoie and Aggie, denied him the luxury of declaring himself so.He sank
mutely on the end of the couch and proceeded to sulk in silence.As for Aggie and Zoie, they continued to gaze open-mouthed at Alfred,
who was waltzing about the room transported into a new heaven of delight
at having snatched his heir from the danger of another night ramble with
Jimmy."Did a horrid old Jimmy spoil his 'itty nap'?"Then
with a sudden exclamation of alarm, he turned toward the anxious women.he cried, as he stared intently into Baby's face.Aggie pretended to glance over Alfred's shoulder."Why so it has," she agreed nervously."It's all right now," counselled Aggie, "so long as it didn't turn in
too suddenly.""We'd better keep him warm, hadn't we?"suggested Alfred, remembering
Aggie's previous instructions on a similar occasion."I'll put him in
his crib," he decided, and thereupon he made a quick move toward the
bassinette.Staggering back from the cradle with the unsteadiness of a drunken man
Alfred called upon the Diety.he demanded as he pointed
toward the unexpected object before him.Neither Zoie, Aggie, nor Jimmy could command words to assist Alfred's
rapidly waning powers of comprehension, and it was not until he had
swept each face for the third time with a look of inquiry that Zoie
found breath to stammer nervously, "Why--why--why, that's the OTHER
one."echoed Alfred in a dazed manner; then he turned to
Aggie for further explanation."Yes," affirmed Aggie, with an emphatic nod, "the other one."An undescribable joy was dawning on Alfred's face."You don't mean----" He stared from the infant in his arms to the one in
the cradle, then back again at Aggie and Zoie.Alfred turned toward
Zoie for the final confirmation of his hopes."Yes, dear," assented Zoie sweetly, "that's Alfred."What Jimmy and the women saw next appeared to be the dance of a whirling
dervish; as a matter of fact, it was merely a man, mad with delight,
clasping two infants in long clothes and circling the room with them.When Alfred could again enunciate distinctly, he rushed to Zoie's side
with the babes in his arms."My darling," he exclaimed, "why didn't you tell me?""I was ashamed," whispered Zoie, hiding her head to shut out the sight
of the red faces pressed close to hers.cried Alfred, struggling to control his complicated
emotions; then gazing at the precious pair in his arms, he cast his eyes
devoutly toward heaven, "Was ever a man so blessed?"Zoie peeped from the covers with affected shyness."I love you TWICE as much," declared Alfred, and with that he sank
exhausted on the foot of the bed, vainly trying to teeter one son on
each knee.CHAPTER XXII

When Jimmy gained courage to turn his eyes in the direction of the
family group he had helped to assemble, he was not reassured by the
reproachful glances that he met from Aggie and Zoie.It was apparent
that in their minds, he was again to blame for something.Realising that
they dared not openly reproach him before Alfred, he decided to make his
escape while his friend was still in the room.He reached for his hat
and tiptoed gingerly toward the door, but just as he was congratulating
himself upon his decision, Alfred called to him with a mysterious air."Jimmy," he said, "just a minute," and he nodded for Jimmy to approach.It must have been Jimmy's guilty conscience that made him powerless
to disobey Alfred's every command.Anyway, he slunk back to the fond
parent's side, where he ultimately allowed himself to be inveigled into
swinging his new watch before the unattentive eyes of the red-faced
babes on Alfred's knees."Lower, Jimmy, lower," called Alfred as Jimmy absent-mindedly allowed
the watch to swing out of the prescribed orbit."Look at the darlings,
Jimmy, look at them," he exclaimed as he gazed at the small creatures
admiringly."Yes, look at them, Jimmy," repeated Zoie, and she glared at Jimmy
behind Alfred's back."Don't you wish you had one of them, Jimmy?'""Well, _I_ wish he had," commented Zoie, and she wondered how she was
ever again to detach either of them from Alfred's breast.Before she could form any plan, the telephone rang loud and
persistently.Jimmy glanced anxiously toward the women for instructions."I'll answer it," said Aggie with suspicious alacrity, and she crossed
quickly toward the 'phone.The scattered bits of conversation that Zoie
was able to gather from Aggie's end of the wire did not tend to soothe
her over-excited nerves.As for Alfred, he was fortunately so engrossed
with the babies that he took little notice of what Aggie was saying."Certainly not," exclaimed Aggie,
"don't let her come up; send her away.Hardy can't see anyone at
all."Then followed a bit of pantomime between Zoie and Aggie, from
which it appeared that their troubles were multiplying, then Aggie again
gave her attention to the 'phone."I don't know anything about her," she
fibbed, "that woman must have the wrong address."And with that she hung
up the receiver and came towards Alfred, anxious to get possession of
his two small charges and to get them from the room, lest the mother who
was apparently downstairs should thrust herself into their midst.asked Alfred, and he nodded toward the
telephone."Oh, just some woman with the wrong address," answered Aggie with
affected carelessness."You'd better let me take the babies now,
Alfred.""To bed," answered Aggie sweetly, "they are going to sleep in the next
room with Jimmy and me."She laid a detaining hand on Jimmy's arm."It's very late," argued Aggie."Of course it is," insisted Zoie."Please, Alfred," she pleaded, "do let
Aggie take them.""Mother knows best," he sighed, but ignoring
Aggie's outstretched arms, he refused to relinquish the joy of himself
carrying the small mites to their room, and he disappeared with the two
of them, singing his now favourite lullaby.When Alfred had left the room, Jimmy, who was now seated comfortably in
the rocker, was rudely startled by a sharp voice at either side of him.shrieked Zoie, with all the disapproval that could be got into
the one small word."You're very clever, aren't you?"sneered Aggie at Jimmy's other elbow."A nice fix you've got me into NOW," reproved Zoie."Why didn't you get out when you had the chance?""You would take your own sweet time, wouldn't you," said Zoie.exclaimed Zoie, and she walked up and down the room
excitedly, oblivious of the disarrangement of her flying negligee."Oh yes," assented Jimmy, as he sank back into the rocker and
began propelling himself to and fro."I never felt better," but a
disinterested observer would have seen in him the picture of discomfort."You're going to feel a great deal WORSE," he was warned by Aggie."Do
you know who that was on the telephone?""She's down stairs," explained Aggie.Jimmy had stopped rocking--his face now wore an uneasy expression."It's time you showed a little human intelligence," taunted Zoie, then
she turned her back upon him and continued to Aggie, "what did she say?""She says," answered Aggie, with a threatening glance toward Jimmy,
"that she won't leave this place until Jimmy gives her baby back.""Let her have her old baby," said Jimmy.snapped Zoie indignantly, "what have YOU got to do
with it?""Oh nothing, nothing," acquiesced Jimmy meekly, "I'm a mere detail.""A lot you care what becomes of me," exclaimed Zoie reproachfully; then
she turned to Aggie with a decided nod."Well, I want it," she asserted."But Zoie," protested Aggie in astonishment, "you can't mean to keep
BOTH of them?""Jimmy has presented Alfred with twins," continued Zoie testily, "and
now, he has to HAVE twins."Jimmy's eyes were growing rounder and rounder."Do you know," continued Zoie, with a growing sense of indignation,
"what would happen to me if I told Alfred NOW that he WASN'T the father
of twins?He'd fly straight out of that door and I'd never see him
again."Aggie admitted that Zoie was no doubt speaking the truth."Jimmy has awakened Alfred's paternal instinct for twins," declared
Zoie, with another emphatic nod of her head, "and now Jimmy must take
the consequences."Jimmy tried to frame a few faint objections, but Zoie waved him aside,
with a positive air.If it were only ONE, it
wouldn't be so bad, but to tell Alfred that he's lost twins, he couldn't
live through it.""But Zoie," argued Aggie, "we can't have that mother hanging around down
stairs until that baby is an old man.She'll have us arrested, the next
thing."asked Zoie, with wide baby eyes.And she nodded toward the now utterly vanquished
Jimmy."That's right," murmured Jimmy, with a weak attempt at sarcasm, "don't
leave me out of anything good.""It doesn't matter WHICH one she arrests," decided the practical Aggie."Well, it matters to me," objected Zoie."And to me too, if it's all the same to you," protested Jimmy."Whoever it is," continued Aggie, "the truth is bound to come out.Alfred will have to know sooner or later, so we might as well make a
clean breast of it, first as last.""That's the first sensible thing you've said in three months," declared
Jimmy with reviving hope.sneered Zoie, and she levelled her most malicious look
at Jimmy."What do you think Alfred would do to YOU, Mr.Jimmy, if he
knew the truth?YOU'RE the one who sent him the telegram; you are the
one who told him that he was a FATHER.""That's true," admitted Aggie, with a wrinkled forehead.Zoie was quick to see her advantage."And Alfred
hasn't any sense of humour, you know."And with that he
sank into his habitual state of dumps."Your sarcasm will do a great deal of good," flashed Zoie.Then she
dismissed him with a nod, and crossed to her dressing table."But Zoie," persisted Aggie, as she followed her young friend in
trepidation, "don't you realise that if you persist in keeping this
baby, that mother will dog Jimmy's footsteps for the rest of his life?""That will be nice," murmured Jimmy.Zoie busied herself with her toilet, and turned a deaf ear to Aggie.There was a touch of genuine emotion in Aggie's voice when she
continued."Just think of it, Zoie, Jimmy will never be able to come and go like a
free man again.""What do I care how he comes and goes?""If
Jimmy had gone when we told him to go, that woman would have had her old
baby by now; but he didn't, oh no!All he ever does is to sit around and
talk about his dinner.""Yes," cried Jimmy hotly, "and that's about as far as I ever GET with
it.""You'll never get anywhere with anything," was Zoie's exasperating
answer."Well, there's nothing slow about you," retorted Jimmy, stung to a
frenzy by her insolence."Oh please, please," interposed Aggie, desperately determined to keep
these two irascible persons to the main issue."What are we going to
tell that mother?""You can tell her whatever you like," answered Zoie, with an impudent
toss of her head, "but I'll NOT give up that baby until I get ANOTHER
one.'It was apparent that he must needs
increase the number of his brain cells if he were to follow this
extraordinary young woman's line of thought much further."You don't
expect to go on multiplying them forever, do you?""YOU are the one who has been multiplying them," was Zoie's
disconcerting reply.It was evident to Jimmy that he could not think fast enough nor clearly
enough to save himself from a mental disaster if he continued to argue
with the shameless young woman, so he contented himself by rocking to
and fro and murmuring dismally that he had "known from the first that it
was to be an endless chain."While Zoie and Jimmy had been wrangling, Aggie had been weighing the
pros and cons of the case.She now turned to Jimmy with a tone of firm
but motherly decision."Zoie is quite right," she said.Jimmy rolled his large eyes up at his spouse with a "you too, Brutus,"
expression.Aggie continued mercilessly, "It's the only way, Jimmy."No sooner had Aggie arrived at her decision than Zoie upset her
tranquillity by a triumphant expression of "I have it."Jimmy and Aggie gazed at Zoie's radiant face in consternation.They were
accustomed to see only reproach there.Her sudden enthusiasm increased
Jimmy's uneasiness."YOU have it," he grunted without attempting to conceal his disgust."SHE'S the one who generally has it."Inflamed by her young friend's enthusiasm, Aggie rushed to her eagerly.exclaimed Zoie, as though the revelation had come
straight from heaven."SHE HAD TWINS," and with that, two pairs of eyes
turned expectantly toward the only man in the room.Tracing the pattern of the rug with his toe, Jimmy remained stubbornly
oblivious of their attentions.He rearranged the pillows on the couch,
and finally, for want of a better occupation, he wound his watch.He could feel Zoie's cat-like gaze upon him."Jimmy can get the other one," she said."The hell I can," exclaimed Jimmy, starting to his feet and no longer
considering time or place.The two women gazed at him reproachfully.cried Aggie, in a shocked, hurt voice."That's the first time
I've ever heard you swear.""Well, it won't be the LAST time," declared Jimmy hotly, "if THIS keeps
up."He paced to and fro like an infuriated lion."Dearest," said Aggie, "you look almost imposing.""Nonsense," interrupted Zoie, who found Jimmy unusually ridiculous."If
I'd known that Jimmy was going to put such an idea into Alfred's head,
I'd have got the two in the first place.""Of course she will," answered Zoie, leaving Jimmy entirely out of
the conversation."She's as poor as a church mouse.What could she do with one twin, anyway?"A snort of rage from Jimmy did not disturb Zoie's enthusiasm.She
proceeded to elaborate her plan."I'll adopt them," she declared, "I'll leave them all Alfred's money.Think of Alfred having real live twins for keeps.""It would be nice, wouldn't it?"Zoie turned to Jimmy, as though they were on the best of terms.Before Jimmy could declare himself penniless, Aggie answered for him
with the greatest enthusiasm, "He has a whole lot; he drew some today."exclaimed Zoie to the abashed Jimmy, and then she continued in a
matter-of-fact tone, "Now, Jimmy," she said, "you go give the washwoman
what money you have on account, then tell her to come around here in the
morning when Alfred has gone out and I'll settle all the details with
her.Go on now, Jimmy," she continued, "you don't need another letter.""No," chimed in Aggie sweetly; "you know her now, dear.""Oh, yes," corroborated Jimmy, with a sarcastic smile and without
budging from the spot on which he stood, "we are great pals now."asked Zoie, astonished that Jimmy was not starting
on his mission with alacrity."You know what happened the last time you hesitated," warned Aggie."I know what happened when I DIDN'T hesitate," ruminated Jimmy, still
holding his ground.Zoie's eyes were wide with surprise."You don't mean to say," she
exclaimed incredulously, "that you aren't GOING--after we have thought
all this out just to SAVE you?""Say," answered Jimmy, with a confidential air, "do me a favour, will
you?"But, Jimmy----" protested both women simultaneously; but before they
could get further Alfred's distressed voice reached them from the next
room.CHAPTER XVIII

What seemed to be a streak of pink through the room was in reality Zoie
bolting for the bed.While Zoie hastened to snuggle comfortably under the covers, Aggie tried
without avail to get Jimmy started on his errand.Getting no response from Aggie, Alfred, bearing one infant in his arms,
came in search of her.Apparently he was having difficulty with the
unfastening of baby's collar."Aggie," he called sharply, "how on earth do you get this fool pin out?""Take him back, Alfred," answered Aggie impatiently; "I'll be there in a
minute."But Alfred had apparently made up his mind that he was not a success as
a nurse."You'd better take him now, Aggie," he decided, as he offered the small
person to the reluctant Aggie."I'll stay here and talk to Jimmy.""Oh, but Jimmy was just going out," answered Aggie; then she turned to
her obdurate spouse with mock sweetness, "Weren't you, dear?""Yes," affirmed Zoie, with a threatening glance toward Jimmy."Just for a little air," explained Aggie blandly."Yes," growled Jimmy, "another little heir.""He had air a while ago with my
son.He is going to stay here and tell me the news.Sit down, Jimmy,"
he commanded, and to the intense annoyance of Aggie and Zoie, Jimmy sank
resignedly on the couch.Alfred was about to seat himself beside his friend, when the 'phone rang
violently.Being nearest to the instrument, Alfred reached it first and
Zoie and Aggie awaited the consequences in dread.What they heard did
not reassure them nor Jimmy.Jimmy began to wriggle with a vague uneasiness."Well," continued Alfred at the 'phone, "that woman has the wrong
number."Then with a peremptory "Wait a minute," he turned to Zoie, "The
hall boy says that woman who called a while ago is still down stairs and
she won't go away until she has seen you, Zoie.She has some kind of an
idiotic idea that you know where her baby is.""Well," decided Alfred, "I'd better go down stairs and see what's
the matter with her," and he turned toward the door to carry out his
intention.She was half out of bed in her anxiety.'Phone down to the boy to send her away."Oh," said Alfred, "then she's been here before?answered Zoie, trying to gain time for a new inspiration."Why, she's--she's----" her face lit up with satisfaction--the idea had
arrived."She's the nurse," she concluded emphatically."Yes," answered Zoie, pretending to be annoyed with his dull memory."She's the one I told you about, the one I had to discharge.""Oh," said Alfred, with the relief of sudden comprehension; "the crazy
one?"Aggie and Zoie nodded their heads and smiled at him tolerantly, then
Zoie continued to elaborate."You see," she said, "the poor creature was
so insane about little Jimmy that I couldn't go near the child.""I'll soon tell the boy what
to do with her," he declared, and he rushed to the 'phone.Barely had
Alfred taken the receiver from the hook when the outer door was heard
to bang.Before he could speak a distracted young woman, whose excitable
manner bespoke her foreign origin, swept through the door without seeing
him and hurled herself at the unsuspecting Zoie.The woman's black hair
was dishevelled, and her large shawl had fallen from her shoulders.To
Jimmy, who was crouching behind an armchair, she seemed a giantess.cried the frenzied mother, with what was unmistakably an
Italian accent.There was no answer; her eyes sought
the cradle.she shrieked, then upon finding the cradle empty, she
redoubled her lamentations and again she bore down upon the terrified
Zoie."You," she cried, "you know where my baby is!"For answer, Zoie sank back amongst her pillows and drew the bed covers
completely over her head.Alfred approached the bed to protect his young
wife; the Italian woman wheeled about and perceived a small child in his
arms."I knew it," she cried; "I knew it!"Managing to disengage himself from what he considered a mad woman, and
elevating one elbow between her and the child, Alfred prevented the
mother from snatching the small creature from his arms."Calm yourself, madam," he commanded with a superior air."We are very
sorry for you, of course, but we can't have you coming here and going on
like this.He's OUR baby and----"

"He's NOT your baby!"cried the infuriated mother; "he's MY baby.Give him to me," and with that she sprang upon the
uncomfortable Alfred like a tigress.Throwing her whole weight on his
uplifted elbow, she managed to pull down his arm until she could look
into the face of the washerwoman's promising young offspring.The air
was rent by a scream that made each individual hair of Jimmy's head
stand up in its own defence.He could feel a sickly sensation at the top
of his short thick neck."He's NOT my baby," wailed the now demented mother, little dreaming that
the infant for which she was searching was now reposing comfortably on a
soft pillow in the adjoining room.As for Alfred, all of this was merely confirmation of Zoie's statement
that this poor soul was crazy, and he was tempted to dismiss her with
worthy forbearance."I am glad, madam," he said, "that you are coming to your senses."Now, all would have gone well and the bewildered mother would no doubt
have left the room convinced of her mistake, had not Jimmy's nerves got
the better of his judgment.Having slipped cautiously from his position
behind the armchair he was tiptoeing toward the door, and was flattering
himself on his escape, when suddenly, as his forward foot cautiously
touched the threshold, he heard the cry of the captor in his wake, and
before he could possibly command the action of his other foot, he felt
himself being forcibly drawn backward by what appeared to be his too
tenacious coat-tails."If only they would tear," thought Jimmy, but thanks to the excellence
of the tailor that Aggie had selected for him, they did NOT "tear."Not until she had anchored Jimmy safely to the centre of the rug did the
irate mother pour out the full venom of her resentment toward him.From
the mixture of English and Italian that followed, it was apparent that
she was accusing Jimmy of having stolen her baby."Take me to him," she demanded tragically; "my baby--take me to him!""Humour her," whispered Alfred, much elated by the evidence of his
own self-control as compared to Jimmy's utter demoralisation under the
apparently same circumstances.Alfred was becoming vexed; he pointed first to his own forehead, then
to that of Jimmy's hysterical captor.He even illustrated his meaning
by making a rotary motion with his forefinger, intended to remind Jimmy
that the woman was a lunatic.Still Jimmy only stared at him and all the while the woman was becoming
more and more emphatic in her declaration that Jimmy knew where her baby
was."Sure, Jimmy," said Alfred, out of all patience with Jimmy's stupidity
and tiring of the strain of the woman's presence.cried the mother, and she towered over Jimmy with a wild light in
her eyes."Take me to him," she demanded; "take me to him."Jimmy rolled his large eyes first toward Aggie, then toward Zoie and at
last toward Alfred."Take her to him, Jimmy," commanded a concert of voices; and pursued by
a bundle of waving colours and a medley of discordant sounds, Jimmy shot
from the room.CHAPTER XXIV

The departure of Jimmy and the crazed mother was the occasion for a
general relaxing among the remaining occupants of the room.Exhausted
by what had passed Zoie had ceased to interest herself in the future.It
was enough for the present that she could sink back upon her pillows and
draw a long breath without an evil face bending over her, and without
the air being rent by screams.As for Aggie, she fell back upon the window seat and closed her eyes.The horrors into which Jimmy might be rushing had not yet presented
themselves to her imagination.Of the three, Alfred was the only one who had apparently received
exhilaration from the encounter.He was strutting about the room with
the babe in his arms, undoubtedly enjoying the sensations of a hero.When he could sufficiently control his feeling of elation, he looked
down at the small person with an air of condescension and again lent
himself to the garbled sort of language with which defenceless infants
are inevitably persecuted."Tink of dat horrid old woman wanting to steal our own little oppsie,
woppsie, toppsie babykins," he said.Then he turned to Zoie with an
air of great decision."That woman ought to be locked up," he declared,
"she's dangerous," and with that he crossed to Aggie and hurriedly
placed the infant in her unsuspecting arms."Here, Aggie," he said, "you
take Alfred and get him into bed."Glad of an excuse to escape to the next room and recover her self
control, Aggie quickly disappeared with the child.For some moments Alfred continued to pace up and down the room; then he
came to a full stop before Zoie."I'll have to have something done to that woman," he declared
emphatically."Jimmy will do enough to her," sighed Zoie, weakly."She's no business to be at large," continued Alfred; then, with a
business-like air, he started toward the telephone.He was now calling into the 'phone, "Give me
information."demanded Zoie, more and more disturbed by
his mysterious manner."One can't be too careful," retorted Alfred in his most paternal
fashion; "there's an awful lot of kidnapping going on these days.""Well, you don't suspect information, do you?"Again Alfred ignored her; he was intent upon things of more importance."Hello," he called into the 'phone, "is this information?"Apparently it
was for he continued, with a satisfied air, "Well, give me the Fullerton
Street Police Station."cried Zoie, sitting up in bed and looking about the room
with a new sense of alarm.shrieked the over-wrought young wife."Now, now, dear, don't get nervous,"
he said, "I am only taking the necessary precautions."And again he
turned to the 'phone.Alarmed by Zoie's summons, Aggie entered the room hastily.She was not
reassured upon hearing Alfred's further conversation at the 'phone."Is this the Fullerton Street Police Station?"echoed Aggie, and her eyes sought Zoie's inquiringly.called Alfred over his shoulder to the excited Aggie, then
he continued into the 'phone.Well, hello, Donneghey, this is your
old friend Hardy, Alfred Hardy at the Sherwood.I've just got back,"
then he broke the happy news to the no doubt appreciative Donneghey.he said, "I'm a happy father."Zoie puckered her small face in disgust.Alfred continued to elucidate joyfully at the 'phone."Doubles," he said, "yes--sure--on the level.""I don't know why you have to tell the whole neighbourhood," snapped
Zoie.But Alfred was now in the full glow of his genial account to his friend.he repeated in answer to an evident suggestion from the
other end of the line, "I should say I would.Tell
the boys I'll be right over.And say, Donneghey," he added, in a more
confidential tone, "I want to bring one of the men home with me.I
want him to keep an eye on the house to-night"; then after a pause, he
concluded confidentially, "I'll tell you all about it when I get there.It looks like a kidnapping scheme to me," and with that he hung up the
receiver, unmistakably pleased with himself, and turned his beaming face
toward Zoie."It's all right, dear," he said, rubbing his hands together with evident
satisfaction, "Donneghey is going to let us have a Special Officer to
watch the house to-night.""I won't HAVE a special officer," declared Zoie vehemently; then
becoming aware of Alfred's great surprise, she explained half-tearfully,
"I'm not going to have the police hanging around our very door.I would
feel as though I were in prison.""You ARE in prison, my dear," returned the now irrepressible Alfred."A
prison of love--you and our precious boys."He stooped and implanted a
gracious kiss on her forehead, then turned toward the table for his hat."Now," he said, "I'll just run around the corner, set up the drinks for
the boys, and bring the officer home with me," and drawing himself up
proudly, he cried gaily in parting, "I'll bet there's not another man in
Chicago who has what I have to-night.""I hope not," groaned Zoie.Then,
thrusting her two small feet from beneath the coverlet and perching on
the side of the bed, she declared to Aggie that "Alfred was getting more
idiotic every minute.""He's worse than idiotic," corrected Aggie.If
he gets the police around here before we give that baby back, they'll
get the mother.She'll tell all she knows and that will be the end of
Jimmy!"exclaimed Zoie, "it'll be the end of ALL of us.""I can see our pictures in the papers, right now," groaned Aggie."Jimmy IS a villain," declared Zoie.How am I ever going to get that other twin?""There is only one thing to do," decided Aggie, "I must go for it
myself."And she snatched up her cape from the couch and started toward
the door.cried Zoie, in alarm, "and leave me alone?""It's our only chance," argued Aggie."I'll have to do it now, before
Alfred gets back.""But Aggie," protested Zoie, clinging to her departing friend, "suppose
that crazy mother should come back?""Nonsense," replied Aggie, and before Zoie could actually realise what
was happening the bang of the outside door told her that she was alone.CHAPTER XXV

Wondering what new terrors awaited her, Zoie glanced uncertainly from
door to door.So strong had become her habit of taking refuge in the
bed, that unconsciously she backed toward it now.Barely had she reached
the centre of the room when a terrific crash of breaking glass from the
adjoining room sent her shrieking in terror over the footboard, and head
first under the covers.Here she would doubtless have remained until
suffocated, had not Jimmy in his backward flight from one of the
inner rooms overturned a large rocker.This additional shock to Zoie's
overstrung nerves forced a wild scream from her lips, and an answering
exclamation from the nerve-racked Jimmy made her sit bolt upright.She
gazed at him in astonishment.His tie was awry, one end of his collar
had taken leave of its anchorage beneath his stout chin, and was now
just tickling the edge of his red, perspiring brow.His hair was on end
and his feelings were undeniably ruffled.As usual Zoie's greeting did
not tend to conciliate him."The fire-escape," panted Jimmy and he nodded mysteriously toward the
inner rooms of the apartment.There was only one and that led through the
bathroom window.He was now peeping cautiously out of the
window toward the pavement below.Jimmy jerked his thumb in the direction of the street.Zoie gazed at him
with grave apprehension.Jimmy shook his head and continued to peer cautiously out of the window."What did _I_ do with her?"repeated Jimmy, a flash of his old
resentment returning.For the first time, Zoie became fully conscious of Jimmy's ludicrous
appearance.Her overstrained nerves gave way and she began to laugh
hysterically."Say," shouted Jimmy, towering over the bed and devoutly wishing that
she were his wife so that he might strike her with impunity."Don't you
sic any more lunatics onto me."It is doubtful whether Zoie's continued laughter might not have provoked
Jimmy to desperate measures, had not the 'phone at that moment directed
their thoughts toward worse possibilities.After the instrument had
continued to ring persistently for what seemed to Zoie an age, she
motioned to Jimmy to answer it.He responded by retreating to the other
side of the room."It may be Aggie," suggested Zoie.For the first time, Jimmy became aware that Aggie was nowhere in the
apartment.he exclaimed, as he realised that he was again tete-a-tete
with the terror of his dreams."Gone to do what YOU should have done," was Zoie's characteristic
answer."Well," answered Jimmy hotly, "it's about time that somebody besides me
did something around this place.""YOU," mocked Zoie, "all YOU'VE ever done was to hoodoo me from the very
beginning.""If you'd taken my advice," answered Jimmy, "and told your husband the
truth about the luncheon, there'd never have been any 'beginning.'""If, if, if," cried Zoie, in an agony of impatience, "if you'd tipped
that horrid old waiter enough, he'd never have told anyway.""I'm not buying waiters to cover up your crimes," announced Jimmy with
his most self-righteous air."You'll be buying more than that to cover up your OWN crimes before
you've finished," retorted Zoie."Before I've finished with YOU, yes," agreed Jimmy.He wheeled upon her
with increasing resentment."Do you know where I expect to end up?""I know where you OUGHT to end up," snapped Zoie."I'll finish in the electric chair," said Jimmy."I can feel blue
lightning chasing up and down my spine right now.""Well, I wish you HAD finished in the electric chair," declared Zoie,
"before you ever dragged me into that awful old restaurant."answered Jimmy shaking his fist at her across the
foot of the bed.For the want of adequate words to express his further
feelings, Jimmy was beginning to jibber, when the outer door was
heard to close, and he turned to behold Aggie entering hurriedly with
something partly concealed by her long cape."It's all right," explained Aggie triumphantly to Zoie.She threw her cape aside and disclosed the fruits of her conquest."So," snorted Jimmy in disgust, slightly miffed by the apparent ease
with which Aggie had accomplished a task about which he had made so much
ado, "you've gone into the business too, have you?"She continued in a businesslike tone to
Zoie."Thank Heaven," sighed Aggie, then she turned to Jimmy and addressed him
in rapid, decided tones."Now, dear," she said, "I'll just put the new
baby to bed, then I'll give you the other one and you can take it right
down to the mother."Jimmy made a vain start in the direction of the fire-escape.Four
detaining hands were laid upon him."Don't try anything like that," warned Aggie; "you can't get out of this
house without that baby.And Aggie sailed triumphantly out of the room to
make the proposed exchange of babies.Before Jimmy was able to suggest to himself an escape from Aggie's last
plan of action, the telephone again began to cry for attention.Neither Jimmy nor Zoie could summon courage to approach the impatient
instrument, and as usual Zoie cried frantically for Aggie.Aggie was not long in returning to the room and this time she bore in
her arms the infant so strenuously demanded by its mad mother."Here you are, Jimmy," she said; "here's the other one.Now take him
down stairs quickly before Alfred gets back."She attempted to place the
unresisting babe in Jimmy's chubby arms, but Jimmy's freedom was not to
be so easily disposed of.he exclaimed, backing away from the small creature in fear and
abhorrence, "take that bundle of rags down to the hotel office and have
that woman hystericing all over me."Oh well," answered Aggie, distracted by the persistent ringing of the
'phone, "then hold him a minute until I answer the 'phone."This at least was a compromise, and reluctantly Jimmy allowed the now
wailing infant to be placed in his arms."Jig it, Jimmy, jig it," cried Zoie.Jimmy looked down helplessly at
the baby's angry red face, but before he had made much headway with the
"jigging," Aggie returned to them, much excited by the message which she
had just received over the telephone."That mother is making a scene down stairs in the office," she said."You hear," chided Zoie, in a fury at Jimmy, "what did Aggie tell you?""If she wants this thing," maintained Jimmy, looking down at the bundle
in his arms, "she can come after it.""We can't have her up here," objected Aggie."Alfred may be back at any minute.You know what
happened the last time we tried to change them.""You can send it down the chimney, for all I care," concluded Jimmy.exclaimed Aggie, her face suddenly illumined."Oh Lord," groaned Jimmy, who had come to regard any elation on Zoie's
or Aggie's part as a sure forewarner of ultimate discomfort for him.Again Aggie had recourse to the 'phone."Hello," she called to the office boy, "tell that woman to go around to
the back door, and we'll send something down to her."There was a slight
pause, then Aggie added sweetly, "Yes, tell her to wait at the foot of
the fire-escape."Zoie had already caught the drift of Aggie's intention and she now fixed
her glittering eyes upon Jimmy, who was already shifting about uneasily
and glancing at Aggie, who approached him with a business-like air."Now, dear," said Aggie, "come with me.I'll hand Baby out through the
bathroom window and you can run right down the fire-escape with him.""If I do run down the fire-escape," exclaimed Jimmy, wagging his large
head from side to side, "I'll keep right on RUNNING.That's the last
you'll ever see of me.""But, Jimmy," protested Aggie, slightly hurt by his threat, "once that
woman gets her baby you'll have no more trouble."asked Jimmy, looking from one to the other."She'll be up here if you don't hurry," urged Aggie impatiently, and
with that she pulled Jimmy toward the bedroom door."Let her come," said Jimmy, planting his feet so as to resist Aggie's
repeated tugs, "I'm going to South America.""Why will you act like this," cried Aggie, in utter desperation, "when
we have so little time?""Say," said Jimmy irrelevantly, "do you know that I haven't had any----"

"Yes," interrupted Aggie and Zoie in chorus, "we know.""How long," continued Zoie impatiently, "is it going to take you to slip
down that fire-escape?""That depends on how fast I'slip,'" answered Jimmy doggedly."You'll'slip' all right," sneered Zoie.Further exchange of pleasantries between these two antagonists was cut
short by the banging of the outside door.exclaimed Aggie, glancing nervously over her shoulder,
"there's Alfred now.Hurry, Jimmy, hurry," she cried, and with that she
fairly forced Jimmy out through the bedroom door, and followed in his
wake to see him safely down the fire-escape.CHAPTER XXVI

Zoie had barely time to arrange herself after the manner of an
interesting invalid, when Alfred entered the room in the gayest of
spirits."Hello, dearie," he cried as he crossed quickly to her side.asked Zoie faintly and she glanced uneasily toward the door,
through which Jimmy and Aggie had just disappeared."I told you I shouldn't be long," said Alfred jovially, and he implanted
a condescending kiss on her forehead.he
asked, rubbing his hands together in satisfaction."You're all cold," pouted Zoie, edging away, "and you've been drinking.""I had to have one or two with the boys," said Alfred, throwing out his
chest and strutting about the room, "but never again.From now on I cut
out all drinks and cigars.This is where I begin to live my life for our
sons."asked Zoie, as she began to see long years
of boredom stretching before her."You and our boys are one and the same, dear," answered Alfred, coming
back to her side."You mean you couldn't go on loving ME if it weren't for the BOYS?"She was beginning to realise how completely
her hold upon him depended upon her hideous deception."Of course I could, Zoie," answered Alfred, flattered by what he
considered her desire for his complete devotion, "but----"

"But not so MUCH," pouted Zoie."Well, of course, dear," admitted Alfred evasively, as he sank down upon
the edge of the bed by her side--

"You needn't say another word," interrupted Zoie, and then with a shade
of genuine repentance, she declared shame-facedly that she hadn't been
"much of a wife" to Alfred.contradicted the proud young father, "you've given me the
ONE thing that I wanted most in the world.""But you see, dear," said Zoie, as she wound her little white arms about
his neck, and looked up into his face adoringly, "YOU'VE been the 'ONE'
thing that I wanted 'MOST' and I never realised until to-night how--how
crazy you are about things.""Well," said Zoie, letting her eyes fall before his and picking at a bit
of imaginary lint on the coverlet, "babies and things.""Oh," said Alfred, and he was about to proceed when she again
interrupted him."But now that I DO realise it," continued Zoie, earnestly, her fingers
on his lips, lest he again interrupt, "if you'll only have a little
patience with me, I'll--I'll----" again her eyes fell bashfully to the
coverlet, as she considered the possibility of being ultimately obliged
to replace the bogus twins with real ones."All the patience in the world," answered Alfred, little dreaming of the
problem that confronted the contrite Zoie."That's all I ask," declared Zoie, her assurance completely restored,
"and in case anything SHOULD happen to THESE----" she glanced anxiously
toward the door through which Aggie had borne the twins."But nothing is going to happen to these, dear," interrupted Alfred,
rising and again assuming an air of fatherly protection.There, there," he added, patting her small shoulder and nodding
his head wisely."That crazy woman has got on your nerves, but you
needn't worry, I've got everything fixed.Donneghey sent a special
officer over with me.shrieked Zoie, fixing her eyes on the bedroom door, through which
Jimmy had lately disappeared and wondering whether he had yet "slipped"
down the fire-escape."Yes," continued Alfred, walking up and down the floor with a masterly
stride."If that woman is caught hanging around here again, she'll get a
little surprise.My boys are safe now, God bless them!"Then reminded of
the fact that he had not seen them since his return, he started quickly
toward the bedroom door."I'll just have a look at the little rascals,"
he decided.She caught Alfred's arm as he passed the side of
her bed, and clung to him in desperation.Alfred looked down at her in surprise.She turned her face toward the door, and called lustily, "Aggie!questioned Alfred, thinking Zoie suddenly ill, "can
I get you something?"Before Zoie was obliged to reply, Aggie answered her summons.she asked, glancing inquiringly into Zoie's distressed
face."Alfred's here," said Zoie, with a sickly smile as she stroked his hand
and glanced meaningly at Aggie.cried Aggie, and involuntarily she took a step backward,
as though to guard the bedroom door."Yes," said Alfred, mistaking Aggie's surprise for a compliment to his
resource; "and now, Aggie, if you'll just stay with Zoie for a minute
I'll have a look at my boys."exclaimed Aggie, nervously, and she placed herself again in
front of the bedroom door.Alfred was plainly annoyed by her proprietory air."I'll not WAKE them," persisted Alfred, "I just wish to have a LOOK at
them," and with that he again made a move toward the door."But Alfred," protested Zoie, still clinging to his hand, "you're not
going to leave me again--so soon."Alfred was becoming more and more restive under the seeming absurdity of
their persistent opposition, but before he could think of a polite way
of over-ruling them, Aggie continued persuasively."You stay with Zoie," she said."I'll bring the boys in here and you can
both have a look at them.""But Aggie," argued Alfred, puzzled by her illogical behaviour, "would
it be wise to wake them?""Now you stay here and I'll get them."Before Alfred could protest further she was out of the room and the door
had closed behind her, so he resigned himself to her decision, banished
his temporary annoyance at her obstinacy, and glanced about the room
with a new air of proprietorship."This is certainly a great night, Zoie," he said."It certainly is," acquiesced Zoie, with an over emphasis that made
Alfred turn to her with new concern."I'm afraid that mad woman made you very nervous, dear," he said.Zoie's nerves were destined to bear still further strain, for at that
moment, there came a sharp ring at the door.Beside herself with anxiety Zoie threw her arms about Alfred, who had
advanced to soothe her, drew him down by her side and buried her head on
his breast."You ARE jumpy," said Alfred, and at that instant a wrangle of loud
voices, and a general commotion was heard in the outer hall.asked Alfred, endeavouring to disentangle himself from Zoie's
frantic embrace.Zoie clung to him so tightly that he was unable to rise, but his alert
ear caught the sound of a familiar voice rising above the din of dispute
in the hallway."That sounds like the officer," he exclaimed.cried Zoie, and she wound her arms more tightly about
him.CHAPTER XXVII

Propelled by a large red fist, attached to the back of his badly wilted
collar, the writhing form of Jimmy was now thrust through the outer
door."Let go of me," shouted the hapless Jimmy.The answer was a spasmodic shaking administered by the fist; then a
large burly officer, carrying a small babe in his arms, shoved the
reluctant Jimmy into the centre of the room and stood guard over him."I got him for you, sir," announced the officer proudly, to the
astonished Alfred, who had just managed to untwine Zoie's arms and to
struggle to his feet.Alfred's eyes fell first upon the dejected Jimmy, then they travelled to
the bundle of long clothes in the officer's arms.He snatched the infant from the officer
and pressed him jealously to his breast."I don't understand," he said,
gazing at the officer in stupefaction.asked the officer, nodding toward the unfortunate
Jimmy."I caught him slipping down your fire-escape.""I KNEW it," exclaimed Zoie in a rage, and she cast a vindictive look at
Jimmy for his awkwardness.Alfred
turned again to the officer, then to Jimmy, who was still flashing
defiance into the officer's threatening eyes.What's the matter with you,
Jimmy?This is the third time that you have tried to take my baby out
into the night.""Then you've had trouble with him before?"He
studied Jimmy with new interest, proud in the belief that he had brought
a confirmed "baby-snatcher" to justice."I've had a little trouble myself," declared Jimmy hotly, now resolved
to make a clean breast of it."I'm not asking about your troubles," interrupted the officer savagely,
and Jimmy felt the huge creature's obnoxious fingers tightening again on
his collar."Go ahead, sir," said the officer to Alfred."Well," began Alfred, nodding toward the now livid Jimmy, "he was out
with my boy when I arrived.I stopped him from going out with him
a second time, and now you, officer, catch him slipping down the
fire-escape.I don't know what to say," he finished weakly."_I_ do," exclaimed Jimmy, feeling more and more like a high explosive,
"and I'll say it."And before Jimmy could get further,
Alfred resumed with fresh vehemence."He's supposed to be a friend of mine," he explained to the officer, as
he nodded toward the wriggling Jimmy."He was all right when I left him
a few months ago.""You'll think I'm all right again," shouted Jimmy, trying to get free
from the officer, "before I've finished telling all I----"

"That won't help any," interrupted the officer firmly, and with another
twist of Jimmy's badly wilted collar he turned to Alfred with his most
civil manner, "What shall I do with him, sir?""I don't know," said Alfred, convinced that his friend was a fit subject
for a straight jacket."It's absurd," cried Zoie, on the verge of hysterics, and in utter
despair of ever disentangling the present complication without
ultimately losing Alfred, "you're all absurd," she cried wildly.exclaimed Alfred, turning upon her in amazement, "what do you
mean?""It's a joke," said Zoie, without the slightest idea of where the joke
lay."If you had any sense you could see it.""I DON'T see it," said Alfred, with hurt dignity."Neither do I," said Jimmy, with boiling resentment."Can you call it a joke," asked Alfred, incredulously, "to have our
boy----" He stopped suddenly, remembering that there was a companion
piece to this youngster.he exclaimed, "our other
boy----" He rushed to the crib, found it empty, and turned a terrified
face to Zoie."Now, Alfred," pleaded Zoie, "don't get excited; he's all right."Zoie did not know, but at that moment her eyes fell upon Jimmy, and as
usual he was the source of an inspiration for her."Jimmy never cared for the other one," she said, "did you, Jimmy?"Alfred turned to the officer, with a tone of command."Wait," he said,
then he started toward the bedroom door to make sure that his other
boy was quite safe.The picture that confronted him brought the hair
straight up on his head.True to her promise, and ignorant of Jimmy's
return with the first baby, Aggie had chosen this ill-fated moment to
appear on the threshold with one babe on each arm."Here they are," she said graciously, then stopped in amazement at sight
of the horrified Alfred, clasping a third infant to his breast.exclaimed Alfred, stroking his forehead with his unoccupied
hand, and gazing at what he firmly believed must be an apparition,
"THOSE aren't MINE," he pointed to the two red mites in Aggie's arms.stammered Aggie for the want of something better
to say.Then he turned in appeal to his young wife,
whose face had now become utterly expressionless.There was an instant's pause, then the blood returned to Zoie's face and
she proved herself the artist that Alfred had once declared her."OURS, dear," she murmured softly, with a bashful droop of her lids.persisted Alfred, pointing to the baby in his arms, and
feeling sure that his mind was about to give way."Why--why--why," stuttered Zoie, "THAT'S the JOKE."echoed Alfred, looking as though he found it anything but
such."Yes," added Aggie, sharing Zoie's desperation to get out of their
temporary difficulty, no matter at what cost in the future.stammered Alfred, "what IS there to tell?""Why, you see," said Aggie, growing more enthusiastic with each
elaboration of Zoie's lie, "we didn't dare to break it to you too
suddenly."gasped Alfred; a new light was beginning to dawn on
his face."So," concluded Zoie, now thoroughly at home in the new situation, "we
asked Jimmy to take THAT one OUT."Jimmy cast an inscrutable glance in Zoie's direction.Was it possible
that she was at last assisting him out of a difficulty?"Yes," confirmed Aggie, with easy confidence, "we wanted you to get used
to the idea gradually."He was afraid to allow his mind to accept
too suddenly the whole significance of their disclosure, lest his joy
over-power him."You--you--do--don't mean----" he stuttered."Yes, dear," sighed Zoie, with the face of an angel, and then with a
languid sigh, she sank back contentedly on her pillows.cried Alfred, now delirious with delight."Give
them to me," he called to Aggie, and he snatched the surprised infants
savagely from her arms."Give me ALL of them, ALL of them."He clasped
the three babes to his breast, then dashed to the bedside of the
unsuspecting Zoie and covered her small face with rapturous kisses.Feeling the red faces of the little strangers in such close proximity to
hers, Zoie drew away from them with abhorrence, but unconscious of her
unmotherly action, Alfred continued his mad career about the room, his
heart overflowing with gratitude toward Zoie in particular and mankind
in general.Finding Aggie in the path of his wild jubilee, he treated
that bewildered young matron to an unwelcome kiss.A proceeding which
Jimmy did not at all approve.Hardly had Aggie recovered from her surprise when the disgruntled
Jimmy was startled out of his dark mood by the supreme insult of a
loud resounding kiss implanted on his own cheek by his excitable young
friend.Jimmy raised his arm to resist a second assault, and Alfred
veered off in the direction of the officer, who stepped aside just in
time to avoid similar demonstration from the indiscriminating young
father.Finding a wide circle prescribed about himself and the babies, Alfred
suddenly stopped and gazed about from one astonished face to the other."Well," said the officer, regarding Alfred with an injured air,
and feeling much downcast at being so ignominiously deprived of his
short-lived heroism in capturing a supposed criminal, "if this is all a
joke, I'll let the woman go.""The woman," repeated Alfred; "what woman?""I nabbed a woman at the foot of the fire-escape," explained the
officer.Zoie and Aggie glanced at each other inquiringly."I thought
she might be an accomplice."His manner was
becoming more paternal, not to say condescending, with the arrival of
each new infant."Don't be silly, Alfred," snapped Zoie, really ashamed that Alfred was
making such an idiot of himself."Oh, that's it," said Alfred, with a wise nod of comprehension; "the
nurse, then she's in the joke too?""You're all in it," he exclaimed, flattered to think
that they had considered it necessary to combine the efforts of so many
of them to deceive him."Yes," assented Jimmy sadly, "we are all 'in it.'""Well, she's a great actress," decided Alfred, with the air of a
connoisseur."She sure is," admitted Donneghey, more and more disgruntled as he felt
his reputation for detecting fraud slipping from him."She put up a
phoney story about the kid being hers," he added."But I could tell she
wasn't on the level.Good-night, sir," he called to Alfred, and ignoring
Jimmy, he passed quickly from the room."Oh, officer," Alfred called after him.I'll
be down later and fix things up with you."Again Alfred gave his whole
attention to his new-found family.He leaned over the cradle and gazed
ecstatically into the three small faces below his."This is too much,"
he murmured."Much too much," agreed Jimmy, who was now sitting hunched up on the
couch in his customary attitude of gloom."You were right not to break it to me too suddenly," said Alfred, and
with his arms encircling three infants he settled himself on the couch
by Jimmy's side."You're a cute one," he continued to Jimmy, who was
edging away from the three mites with aversion.In the absence of any
answer from Jimmy, Alfred appealed to Zoie, "Isn't he a cute one, dear?""Oh, yes, VERY," answered Zoie, sarcastically.Shutting his lips tight and glancing at Zoie with a determined effort at
self restraint, Jimmy rose from the couch and started toward the door."If you women are done with me," he said, "I'll clear out."exclaimed Alfred, rising quickly and placing himself
between his old friend and the door."What a chance," and he laughed
boisterously."You're not going to get out of my sight this night," he
declared."I'm just beginning to appreciate all you've done for me.""So am I," assented Jimmy, and unconsciously his hand sought the spot
where his dinner should have been, but Alfred was not to be resisted."A man needs someone around," he declared, "when he's going through a
thing like this.I need all of you, all of you," and with his eyes he
embraced the weary circle of faces about him."I feel as though I could
go out of my head," he explained and with that he began tucking the
three small mites in the pink and white crib designed for but one.Zoie regarded him with a bored expression'

"You act as though you WERE out of your head," she commented, but Alfred
did not heed her.He was now engaged in the unhoped for bliss of singing
three babies to sleep with one lullaby.The other occupants of the room were just beginning to relax and to show
some resemblance to their natural selves, when their features were again
simultaneously frozen by a ring at the outside door.CHAPTER XXVIII

Annoyed at being interrupted in the midst of his lullaby, to three,
Alfred looked up to see Maggie, hatless and out of breath, bursting into
the room, and destroying what was to him an ideally tranquil home scene.But Maggie paid no heed to Alfred's look of inquiry.She made directly
for the side of Zoie's bed."If you plaze, mum," she panted, looking down at Zoie, and wringing her
hands.asked Aggie, who had now reached the side of the bed."'Scuse me for comin' right in"--Maggie was breathing hard--"but me
mother sint me to tell you that me father is jus afther comin' home from
work, and he's fightin' mad about the babies, mum."cautioned Aggie and Zoie, as they glanced nervously toward
Alfred who was rising from his place beside the cradle with increasing
interest in Maggie's conversation.he repeated, "your father is mad about babies?""It's all right, dear," interrupted Zoie nervously; "you see," she
went on to explain, pointing toward the trembling Maggie, "this is our
washerwoman's little girl.Our washerwoman has had twins, too, and it
made the wash late, and her husband is angry about it.""Oh," said Alfred, with a comprehensive nod, but Maggie was not to be so
easily disposed of."If you please, mum," she objected, "it ain't about the wash.repeated Alfred, drawing himself up in the fond conviction that
all his heirs were boys, "No wonder your pa's angry.Come now," he said to Maggie, patting the child on the shoulder and
regarding her indulgently, "you go straight home and tell your father
that what HE needs is BOYS.""Well, of course, sir," answered the bewildered Maggie, thinking that
Alfred meant to reflect upon the gender of the offspring donated by her
parents, "if you ain't afther likin' girls, me mother sint the money
back," and with that she began to feel for the pocket in her red flannel
petticoat.repeated Alfred, in a puzzled way, "what money?"It was again Zoie's time to think quickly."The money for the wash, dear," she explained.retorted Alfred, positively beaming generosity, "who talks
of money at such a time as this?"And taking a ten dollar bill from his
pocket, he thrust it in Maggie's outstretched hand, while she was trying
to return to him the original purchase money."Here," he said to the
astonished girl, "you take this to your father.Tell him I sent it to
him for his babies.Tell him to start a bank account with it."This was clearly not a case with which one small addled mind could deal,
or at least, so Maggie decided.She had a hazy idea that Alfred was
adding something to the original purchase price of her young sisters,
but she was quite at a loss to know how to refuse the offer of such
a "grand 'hoigh" gentleman, even though her failure to do so would no
doubt result in a beating when she reached home.She stared at Alfred
undecided what to do, the money still lay in her outstretched hand."I'm afraid Pa'll niver loike it, sir," she said.exclaimed Alfred in high feather, and he himself closed her
red little fingers over the bill, "he's GOT to like it.Now you run along," he concluded to Maggie, as he urged her
toward the door, "and tell him what I say.""Yes, sir," murmured Maggie, far from sharing Alfred's enthusiasm.Feeling no desire to renew his acquaintance with Maggie, particularly
under Alfred's watchful eye, Jimmy had sought his old refuge, the high
backed chair.As affairs progressed and there seemed no doubt of Zoie's
being able to handle the situation to the satisfaction of all concerned,
Jimmy allowed exhaustion and the warmth of the firelight to have their
way with him.His mind wandered toward other things and finally into
space.His head dropped lower and lower on his chest; his breathing
became laboured--so laboured in fact that it attracted the attention of
Maggie, who was about to pass him on her way to the door.Then coming close to the
side of the unsuspecting sleeper, she hissed a startling message in his
ear."Me mother said to tell you that me fadder's hoppin' mad at you,
sir."He studied the young person at his
elbow, then he glanced at Alfred, utterly befuddled as to what had
happened while he had been on a journey to happier scenes.Apparently
Maggie was waiting for an answer to something, but to what?Jimmy
thought he detected an ominous look in Alfred's eyes.Letting his hand
fall over the arm of the chair so that Alfred could not see it, Jimmy
began to make frantic signals to Maggie to depart; she stared at him the
harder."Go away," whispered Jimmy, but Maggie did not move.he
said, and waved her off with his hand.Puzzled by Jimmy's sudden aversion to this apparently harmless child,
Alfred turned to Maggie with a puckered brow.For once Jimmy found it in his heart to be grateful to Zoie for the
prompt answer that came from her direction."The wash, dear," said Zoie to Alfred; "Jimmy had to go after the wash,"
and then with a look which Maggie could not mistake for an invitation to
stop longer, Zoie called to her haughtily, "You needn't wait, Maggie; we
understand.""Sure, an' it's more 'an I do," answered Maggie, and shaking her head
sadly, she slipped from the room.But Alfred could not immediately dismiss from his mind the picture of
Maggie's inhuman parent."Just fancy," he said, turning his head to one side meditatively, "fancy
any man not liking to be the father of twins," and with that he again
bent over the cradle and surveyed its contents."Think, Jimmy," he said,
when he had managed to get the three youngsters in his arms, "just think
of the way THAT father feels, and then think of the way _I_ feel.""And then think of the way _I_ feel," grumbled Jimmy.exclaimed Alfred; "what have you to feel about?"Before Jimmy could answer, the air was rent by a piercing scream and a
crash of glass from the direction of the inner rooms.whispered Aggie, with an anxious glance toward Zoie."Sounded like breaking glass," said Alfred.exclaimed Zoie, for want of anything better to suggest.repeated Alfred with a superior air; "nonsense!Here," he said, turning to Jimmy, "you hold the boys and I'll go
see----" and before Jimmy was aware of the honour about to be thrust
upon him, he felt three red, spineless morsels, wriggling about in his
arms.He made what lap he could for the armful, and sat up in a stiff,
strained attitude on the edge of the couch.In the meantime, Alfred had
strode into the adjoining room with the air of a conqueror.Aggie looked
at Zoie, with dreadful foreboding.shrieked the voice of the Italian mother from the adjoining
room.Regardless of the discomfort of his three disgruntled charges, Jimmy
began to circle the room.So agitated was his mind that he could
scarcely hear Aggie, who was reporting proceedings from her place at the
bedroom door."She's come up the fire-escape," cried Aggie; "she's beating Alfred to
death."shrieked Zoie, making a flying leap from her coverlets."She's locking him in the bathroom," declared Aggie, and with that she
disappeared from the room, bent on rescue.cried Zoie, tragically, and she started in pursuit of
Aggie."Wait a minute," called Jimmy, who had not yet been able to find
a satisfactory place in which to deposit his armful of clothes and
humanity."Eat 'em," was Zoie's helpful retort, as the trailing end of her
negligee disappeared from the room.CHAPTER XXIX

Now, had Jimmy been less perturbed during the latter part of this
commotion, he might have heard the bell of the outside door, which
had been ringing violently for some minutes.As it was, he was wholly
unprepared for the flying advent of Maggie."Oh, plaze, sir," she cried, pointing with trembling fingers toward
the babes in Jimmy's arms, "me fadder's coming right behind me.He's
a-lookin' for you sir.""For me," murmured Jimmy, wondering vaguely why everybody on earth
seemed to be looking for HIM."Put 'em down, sir," cried Maggie, still pointing to the three babies,
"put 'em down.asked Jimmy, now utterly confused as to which way to
turn."There," said Maggie, and she pointed to the cradle beneath his very
eyes."Of course," said Jimmy vapidly, and he sank on his knees and strove to
let the wobbly creatures down easily.And with that
disconcerting warning, she too deserted him.Jimmy rose very cautiously from the
cradle, his eyes sought the armchair.He
looked towards the opposite door; beyond that was the mad Italian woman.His one chance lay in slipping unnoticed through the hallway; he made
a determined dash in that direction, but no sooner had he put his head
through the door, than he drew it back quickly.The conversation between
O'Flarety and the maid in the hallway was not reassuring.Jimmy decided
to take a chance with the Italian mother, and as fast as he could, he
streaked it toward the opposite door.The shrieks and denunciations that
he met from this direction were more disconcerting than those of
the Irish father.For an instant he stood in the centre of the room,
wavering as to which side to surrender himself.The thunderous tones of the enraged father drew nearer; he threw himself
on the floor and attempted to roll under the bed; the space between the
railing and the floor was far too narrow.Why had he disregarded Aggie's
advice as to diet?The knob of the door handle was turning--he vaulted
into the bed and drew the covers over his head just as O'Flarety,
trembling with excitement, and pursued by Maggie, burst into the room."Lave go of me," cried O'Flarety to Maggie, who clung to his arm in a
vain effort to soothe him, and flinging her off, he made straight for
the bed."Ah," he cried, gazing with dilated nostrils at the trembling object
beneath the covers, "there you are, mum," and he shook his fist above
what he believed to be the cowardly Mrs."'Tis well ye may cover
up your head," said he, "for shame on yez!Me wife may take in washing,
but when I comes home at night I wants me kids, and I'll be after havin'
'em too.Then getting no response from the
agitated covers, he glanced wildly about the room.he exclaimed as his eyes fell on the crib; but he stopped short in
astonishment, when upon peering into it, he found not one, or two, but
three "barren.""They're child stalers, that's what they are," he declared to Maggie,
as he snatched Bridget and Norah to his no doubt comforting breast."Me
little Biddy," he crooned over his much coveted possession."Me little
Norah," he added fondly, looking down at his second.The thought of his
narrow escape from losing these irreplaceable treasures rekindled
his wrath.Again he strode toward the bed and looked down at the now
semi-quiet comforter."The black heart of ye, mum," he roared, then ordering Maggie to give
back "every penny of that shameless creetur's money" he turned toward
the door.So intense had been O'Flarety's excitement and so engrossed was he in
his denunciation that he had failed to see the wild-eyed Italian woman
rushing toward him from the opposite door.cried the frenzied woman and, to O'Flarety's astonishment,
she laid two strong hands upon his arm and drew him round until he faced
her.she asked, then peering into
the face of the infant nearest to her, she uttered a disappointed
moan.She scanned the face of the second
infant--again she moaned.Having begun to identify this hysterical creature as the possible mother
of the third infant, O'Flarety jerked his head in the direction of the
cradle."I guess you'll find what you're lookin' for in there," he said.Then
bidding Maggie to "git along out o' this" and shrugging his shoulders
to convey his contempt for the fugitive beneath the coverlet, he swept
quickly from the room.Clasping her long-sought darling to her heart and weeping with delight,
the Italian mother was about to follow O'Flarety through the door when
Zoie staggered into the room, weak and exhausted.called the indignant Zoie to the departing mother."How dare
you lock my husband in the bathroom?"She pointed to the key, which the
woman still unconsciously clasped in her hand."Give me that key," she
demanded, "give it to me this instant.""Take your horrid old key," said the mother, and she threw it on the
floor."If you ever try to get my baby again, I'll lock your husband in
JAIL," and murmuring excited maledictions in her native tongue, she took
her welcome departure.Zoie stooped for the key, one hand to her giddy head, but Aggie, who had
just returned to the room, reached the key first and volunteered to go
to the aid of the captive Alfred, who was pounding desperately on the
bathroom door and demanding his instant release."I'll let him out," said Aggie."You get into bed," and she slipped
quickly from the room.Utterly exhausted and half blind with fatigue Zoie lifted the coverlet
and slipped beneath it.Her first sensation was of touching something
rough and scratchy, then came the awful conviction that the thing
against which she lay was alive.Without stopping to investigate the identity of her uninvited
bed-fellow, or even daring to look behind her, Zoie fled from the room
emitting a series of screams that made all her previous efforts in that
direction seem mere baby cries.So completely had Jimmy been enveloped
in the coverlets and for so long a time that he had acquired a vague
feeling of aloftness toward the rest of his fellows, and had lost all
knowledge of their goings and comings.But when his unexpected companion
was thrust upon him he was galvanised into sudden action by her scream,
and swathed in a large pink comforter, he rolled ignominiously from the
upper side of the bed, where he lay on the floor panting and enmeshed,
awaiting further developments.Of one thing he was certain, a great deal
had transpired since he had sought the friendly solace of the covers and
he had no mind to lose so good a friend as the pink comforter.By the
time he had summoned sufficient courage to peep from under its edge, a
babel of voices was again drawing near, and he hastily drew back in his
shell and waited.Not daring to glance at the scene of her fright, Zoie pushed Aggie
before her into the room and demanded that she look in the bed.Seeing the bed quite empty and noticing nothing unusual in the fact that
the pink comforter, along with other covers, had slipped down behind it,
Aggie hastened to reassure her terrified friend."You imagined it, Zoie," she declared, "look for yourself."Zoie's small face peeped cautiously around the edge of the doorway."Well, perhaps I did," she admitted; then she slipped gingerly into the
room, "my nerves are jumping like fizzy water."They were soon to "jump" more, for at this instant, Alfred, burning with
anger at the indignity of having been locked in the bathroom, entered
the room, demanding to know the whereabouts of the lunatic mother, who
had dared to make him a captive in his own house.he called to Zoie and Aggie, and his eye roved wildly
about the room.Then his mind reverted with anxiety to his newly
acquired offspring.he cried, and he rushed toward the crib."Not ALL of them," said Zoie."All," insisted Alfred, and his hands went distractedly toward his head.Zoie and Aggie looked at each other in a dazed way.They had a hazy
recollection of having seen one babe disappear with the Italian woman,
but what had become of the other two?"I don't know," said Zoie, with the first truth she had spoken that
night, "I left them with Jimmy."shrieked Alfred, and a diabolical light lit his features.he snorted, with sudden comprehension, "then he's at it again.And
with that decision he started toward the outer door.protested Zoie, really alarmed by the look that she saw on
his face.Alfred turned to his trembling wife with suppressed excitement, and
patted her shoulder condescendingly."Control yourself, my dear," he said."Control yourself; I'll get
your babies for you--trust me, I'll get them.And then," he added with
parting emphasis from the doorway, "I'll SETTLE WITH JIMMY!"By uncovering one eye, Jimmy could now perceive that Zoie and Aggie
were engaged in a heated argument at the opposite side of the room.By
uncovering one ear he learned that they were arranging a line of action
for him immediately upon his reappearance.He determined not to wait for
the details.Fixing himself cautiously on all fours, and making sure that he was
well covered by the pink comforter, he began to crawl slowly toward the
bedroom door.Turning away from Aggie with an impatient exclamation, Zoie suddenly
beheld what seemed to her a large pink monster with protruding claws
wriggling its way hurriedly toward the inner room.she screamed, and pointing in horror toward the dreadful
creature now dragging itself across the threshold, she sank fainting
into Aggie's outstretched arms.CHAPTER XXX

Having dragged the limp form of her friend to the near-by couch, Aggie
was bending over her to apply the necessary restoratives, when Alfred
returned in triumph.He was followed by the officer in whose arms were
three infants, and behind whom was the irate O'Flarety, the hysterical
Italian woman, and last of all, Maggie."Bring them all in here, officer," called Alfred over his shoulder."I'll soon prove to you whose babies those are."Then turning to Aggie,
who stood between him and the fainting Zoie he cried triumphantly,
"I've got them Aggie, I've got them.""She's fainted," said Aggie, and stepping from in front of the young
wife, she pointed toward the couch.cried Alfred, with deep concern as he rushed to Zoie
and began frantically patting her hands.Then he turned to the officer, his sense of injury welling high within
him, "You see what these people have done to my wife?Ignoring the uncomplimentary remarks of O'Flarety, he again bent over
Zoie."Rouse yourself, my dear," he begged of her.snorted O'Flarety, unable longer to control his pent up
indignation."I'll let you know when I want to hear from you," snarled the officer to
O'Flarety."But they're NOT her babies," protested the Italian woman desperately."Cut it," shouted the officer, and with low mutterings, the outraged
parents were obliged to bide their time.Lifting Zoie to a sitting posture Alfred fanned her gently until she
regained her senses."Your babies are all right," he assured her."I've
brought them all back to you."gasped Zoie weakly, and she wondered what curious fate had been
intervening to assist Alfred in such a prodigious undertaking."Yes, dear," said Alfred, "every one," and he pointed toward the three
infants in the officer's arms.Zoie turned her eyes upon what SEEMED to her numberless red faces.she moaned and again she swooned."I told you she'd be afraid to face us," shouted the now triumphant
O'Flarety.retorted the still credulous Alfred, "how dare you
persecute this poor demented mother?"Alfred's persistent solicitude for Zoie was too much for the resentful
Italian woman."She didn't persecute me, oh no!"Again Zoie was reviving and again Alfred lifted her in his arms and
begged her to assure the officer that the babies in question were hers."Let's hear her SAY it," demanded O'Flarety."You SHALL hear her," answered Alfred, with confidence.Then he beckoned
to the officer to approach, explaining that Zoie was very weak."Sure," said the officer; then planting himself directly in front of
Zoie's half closed eyes, he thrust the babies upon her attention.Zoie opened her eyes to see three small red faces immediately opposite
her own.she cried, with a frantic wave of her arm, "take them
away!"This hateful reminder brought
Alfred again to the protection of his young and defenceless wife."The excitement has unnerved her," he said to the officer."Ain't you about done with my kids?"asked O'Flarety, marvelling how any
man with so little penetration as the officer, managed to hold down a
"good payin' job.""What do you want for your proof anyway?"But Alfred's
faith in the validity of his new parenthood was not to be so easily
shaken."My wife is in no condition to be questioned," he declared."She's out
of her head, and if you don't----"

He stepped suddenly, for without warning, the door was thrown open and a
second officer strode into their midst dragging by the arm the reluctant
Jimmy."I guess I've got somethin' here that you folks need in your business,"
he called, nodding toward the now utterly demoralised Jimmy.exclaimed Aggie, having at last got her breath.cried Alfred, bearing down upon the panting Jimmy with a
ferocious expression."I caught him slipping down the fire-escape," explained the officer.exclaimed Aggie and Alfred in tones of deep reproach."Jimmy," said Alfred, coming close to his friend, and fixing his eyes
upon him in a determined effort to control the poor creature's fast
failing faculties, "you know the truth of this thing.You are the one
who sent me that telegram, you are the one who told me that I was a
father."asked Aggie, trying to protect her dejected
spouse."Of course I am," replied Alfred, with every confidence, "but I have to
prove it to the officer.Then turning to
the uncomfortable man at his side, he demanded imperatively, "Tell the
officer the truth, you idiot.Am I a father or am
I not?""If you're depending on ME for your future offspring," answered Jimmy,
wagging his head with the air of a man reckless of consequences, "you
are NOT a father."gasped Alfred, and he stared at his friend in
bewilderment."Ask them," answered Jimmy, and he nodded toward Zoie and Aggie.Alfred bent over the form of the again prostrate Zoie."My darling,"
he entreated, "rouse yourself.""Now," said
Alfred, with enforced self-control, "you must look the officer squarely
in the eye and tell him whose babies those are," and he nodded toward
the officer, who was now beginning to entertain grave doubts on the
subject.cried Zoie, too exhausted for further lying.exclaimed Alfred, his hand on his forehead."I only borrowed them," said Zoie, "to get you home," and with that she
sank back on the couch and closed her eyes.cried the triumphant O'Flarety."I guess they're your'n all right," admitted the officer doggedly, and
he grudgingly released the three infants to their rightful parents."I guess they'd better be," shouted O'Flarety; then he and the Italian
woman made for the door with their babes pressed close to their hearts.O'Flarety turned in the doorway and raised a warning fist."If you don't leave my kids alone, you'll GIT 'an understanding.'""On your way," commanded the officer to the pair of them, and together
with Maggie and the officer, they disappeared forever from the Hardy
household.he exclaimed; then he turned to
Jimmy who was still in the custody of the second officer: "If I'm not a
father, what am I?""I'd hate to tell you," was Jimmy's unsympathetic reply, and in utter
dejection Alfred sank on the foot of the bed and buried his head in his
hands."What shall I do with this one, sir?"asked the officer, undecided as to
Jimmy's exact standing in the household."Shoot him, for all I care," groaned Alfred, and he rocked to and fro.exclaimed Aggie, then she signalled to the officer to
go."No more of your funny business," said the officer with a parting nod at
Jimmy and a vindictive light in his eyes when he remembered the bruises
that Jimmy had left on his shins.said Aggie sympathetically, and she pressed her hot face
against his round apoplectic cheek.And after all you
have done for us!""Yes," sneered Zoie, having regained sufficient strength to stagger to
her feet, "he's done a lot, hasn't he?"And then forgetting that her
original adventure with Jimmy which had brought about such disastrous
results was still unknown to Aggie and Alfred, she concluded bitterly,
"All this would never have happened, if it hadn't been for Jimmy and his
horrid old luncheon."This was too much, and just as he had seemed to be
well out of complications for the remainder of his no doubt short life.He turned to bolt for the door but Aggie's eyes were upon him.exclaimed Aggie and she regarded him with a puzzled frown.Zoie's hand was already over her lips, but too late.Recovering from his somewhat bewildering sense of loss, Alfred, too, was
now beginning to sit up and take notice.Zoie gazed from Alfred to Aggie, then at Jimmy, then resolving to make
a clean breast of the matter, she sidled toward Alfred with her most
ingratiating manner."Now, Alfred," she purred, as she endeavoured to act one arm about
his unsuspecting neck, "if you'll only listen, I'll tell you the REAL
TRUTH."A wild despairing cry from Alfred, a dash toward the door by Jimmy, and
a determined effort on Aggie's part to detain her spouse, temporarily
interrupted Zoie's narrative.But in spite of these discouragements, Zoie did eventually tell Alfred
the real truth, and before the sun had risen on the beginning of another
day, she had added to her confession, promises whose happy fulfillment
was evidenced for many years after by the chatter of glad young voices,
up and down the stairway of Alfred's new suburban home, and the flutter
of golden curls in and out amongst the sunlight and shadows of his
ample, well kept grounds.(_Pulls away best chair, and goes
for another._) No, no: shot if he shall have the best chair in the
house!If he don't like it, he can lump it.CODDLE (_returns with a stool_).Here's the proper seat for you, you
pig!(_Shouts._) I offer you this with the greatest pleasure.(_Drops voice._) You intolerable
old brute!WHITWELL (_bowing politely_).If you're ever my father-in-law, I'll
show you how to treat a gentleman.I'll give Eglantine to a coal-heaver
first,--the animal!(_Shouts._) Pray be seated, (_drops voice_) and
choke yourself.One gets a very fine appetite after a hard day's
sport.(_Drops voice._) Atrocious old ruffian!(_They sit._)

WHITWELL (_shouts_).Will not Miss Coddle dine with us to-day?(_Shouts._) She's not well.This
soup is cold, I fear.(_Offers some._)

WHITWELL.(_Bows courteously a refusal._)

CODDLE.(_Shouts._) Nay, I insist.(_Drops voice._)
It's smoked,--just fit for you.(_Drops voice._) Old
savage, lucky for you I adore your lovely daughter!Shall I pitch this tureen at his head?--Jane!(_Enter JANE with
a dish._) Take off the soup, Jane.(_Puts dish on table._)

WHITWELL (_shouts_).(_Puts partridge on his own plate._) Jane can't
boil spinach.(_Helps WHITWELL to the spinach._)

WHITWELL (_rises_).(_Drops voice._) Get rid of you

WHITWELL (_aside, furious_).JANE (_aside to WHITWELL_).Don't
upset your fish-kittle.We'll have a little fun with the old
sheep.JANE (_takes box from console, and offers it; shouts_).I hope they'll turn your
stomick.CODDLE (_seizes her ear_).(_Pulls her round._) I'm a sheep, am I?I'm a
mollycoddle, am I?You'll have a little fun out of the old sheep, will you?You
tell me to shut up, eh?Clap me into an asylum, will you?(_Lets go her
ear._)

JANE.(_Crosses to L., screaming._)

                          (_Enter EGLANTINE._)

EGLANTINE.For heaven's sake, what _is_ the matter?WHITWELL (_stupefied_).Perfectly well, sir; and so it seems can you.I
will repeat, if you wish it, every one of those delectable compliments
you paid me five minutes since.WHITWELL (_to EGLANTINE_).Miss Coddle, has he
been shamming deafness, then, all this time?A doctor cured his deafness only half
an hour ago.Dear old master, was it kind to deceive me in this fashion?now ye can hear, I love you tenderer than
ever.Tell you, you pig, you minx!I tell you to walk out of my house.CODDLE (_loud to WHITWELL_).You are an impostor,
sir.EGLANTINE (_shrieks_).(_Hides her
face in her hands._)

WHITWELL.or I should have lost the rapture of
that sweet avowal.Coddle, I love--I adore your daughter.You heard
a moment since the confession that escaped her innocent lips.Surely
you cannot turn a deaf ear to the voice of nature, and see us both
miserable for life.Remember, sir, you have now no deaf ear to turn.Give you my daughter after all your frightful
insults?Remember how you treated me, sir; and reflect, too, that you
began it.Insults are not insults unless intended to be heard.For
every thing I said, I apologize from the bottom of my heart.CODDLE (_after a pause_)._Eglantine._ Papa, of course he does.Whittermat, I can't give my daughter to
a man I never heard of in my life,--and with such a preposterous name
too!My name is Whitwell, my dear sir,--not Whittermat: nephew of
your old friend Benjamin Pottle.What did you tell me your name was Whittermat for?Some singular mistake, sir: I never did.Can't imagine how
the mistake could have occurred.Well, since you heard
all _I_ said--Ha, ha, ha!For every Roland of mine you
gave me two Olivers at least.Diamond cut diamond,--ha, ha, ha!All laugh heartily._)

JANE.I never thought I'd live to see this happy day,
master.Hold your tongue, you impudent cat!Mollycoddle,
indeed!Coddle, you won't go for to turn off a faithful servant in
this way.(_Aside to WHITWELL._) That legacy's lost.(_To CODDLE._) Ah,
master dear!you won't find nobody else as'll work their fingers to the
bone, and their voice to a thread-paper, as I have: up early and down
late, and yelling and screeching from morning till night.Well, the
house will go to rack and ruin when I'm gone,--that's one comfort.WHITWELL (_aside to JANE_).The money's yours, cash down, the day of my
wedding.Well, well, Jane, I'll forgive you, for luck.But I wish you knew how to boil spinach.Harrold for a week
from to-day, and invite all our friends (_to the audience_) to witness
the wedding.All who mean to come will please signify it by clapping their hands,
and the harder the better.(_Curtain falls._)

BAKER, Hamilton Place, Boston, Mass.Transcriber's Note:

    Every effort has been made to replicate this text as faithfully as
    possible.Italic text has been marked with _underscores_.History with them was not a mere record of dates or collection of
genealogical tables, but an essay on the polity of mankind, to which the
narrative afforded the illustration; while their poetry had always a
tendency to assume more a didactic than a lyric form.It is among the
Aryans that the Epos first rose to eminence and the Drama was elevated
above a mere spectacle; but even in these the highest merit sought to be
attained was that they should represent vividly events which might have
taken place, even if they never did happen among men; while the Celts
and the Semites delight in wild imaginings which never could have
existed except in the brain of the poet.When the blood of the Aryan has
been mixed with that of other races, they have produced a literature
eminently imaginative and poetic; but in proportion to their purity has
been their tendency towards a more prosaic style of composition.The aim
of the race has always been the attainment of practical common sense,
and the possession of this quality is their pride and boast, and justly
so; but it is unfortunately antagonistic to the existence of an
imaginative literature, and we must look to them more for eminence in
works on history and philosophy than in those which require imagination
or creative power.These remarks apply with more than double force to the Fine Arts than to
verbal literature.In the first place a people possessing such a power
of phonetic utterance never could look on a picture or statue as more
than a mere subsidiary illustration of the written text.A painting may
represent vividly one view of what took place at one moment of time, but
a written narrative can deal with all the circumstances and link it to
its antecedents and effects.A statue of a man cannot tell one-tenth of
what a short biography will make plain: and an ideal statue or ideal
painting may be a pretty Celtic plaything, but it is not what Aryans
hanker after.Convenience is the first thing
which the practical common sense of the Aryan seeks, and then to gain
what he desires by the readiest and the easiest means.This done, why
should he do more?If, induced by a desire to emulate others, he has to
make his building ornamental, he is willing to copy what experience has
proved to be successful in former works, willing to spend his money and
to submit to some inconvenience; but in his heart he thinks it useless,
and he neither will waste his time in thinking on the subject, nor apply
those energies of his mind to its elaboration, without which nothing
great or good was ever done in Art.In addition to this, the immaterial nature of their faith has always
deprived the Aryan races of the principal incentive to architectural
magnificence.[20] The Turanian and Celtic races always have the most
implicit faith in ceremonial worship and in the necessity of
architectural splendour as its indispensable accompaniment.On the other
hand, the more practical Aryan can never be brought to understand that
prayer is either more sincere or is more acceptable in one form of house
than in any other.He does not feel that virtue can be increased or vice
exterminated by the number of bricks or stones that may be heaped on one
another, or the form in which they may be placed; nor will his
conception of the Deity admit of supposing that He can be propitiated by
palaces or halls erected in honour of Him, or that a building in the
Middle Pointed Gothic is more acceptable than one in the Classic or any
other style.This want of faith may be reasonable, but it is fatal to poetry in Art,
and, it is feared, will prevent the Aryans from attaining more
excellence in Architectural Art at the present time than they have done
in former ages.It is also true that the people are singularly deficient in their
appreciation of colours.Not that actual colour-blindness is more common
with them than with other races, but the harmony of tints is unknown to
them.Some may learn, but none feel it; it is a matter of memory and an
exercise of intellect, but no more.Other—even
savage—races cannot go wrong in this respect.If the Aryan is successful
in art, it is generally in consequence of education, not from feeling;
and, like all that is not innate in man, it yields only a secondary
gratification, and fails to impress his brother man, or to be a real
work of Art.From these causes the ancient Aryans never erected a single building in
India when they were pure, nor in that part of India which they
colonised even after their blood became mixed; and we do not now know
what their style was or is, though the whole of that part of the
peninsula occupied by the Turanians, or to which their influence ever
extended, is, and always was, covered by buildings, vast in extent and
wonderful from their elaboration.This, probably, also is the true cause
of the decline of Architecture and other arts in Europe and in the rest
of the modern world.Wherever the Aryans appear Art flies before them,
and where their influence extends utilitarian practical common sense is
assumed to be all that man should aim at.It may be so, but it is sad to
think that beauty cannot be combined with sense.Music alone, as being the most phonetic of the fine arts, has received
among the Aryans a degree of culture denied to the others; but even here
the tendency has been rather to develop scientific excellence than to
appeal to the responsive chords of the human heart.Notwithstanding
this, its power is more felt and greater excellence is attained in this
science than in any other.It also has escaped the slovenly process of
copying, with which the unartistic mind of the Aryans has been content
to fancy it was creating Art in other branches.If, however, these races have been so deficient in the fine arts, they
have been as excellent in all the useful ones.Agriculture,
manufactures, commerce, ship-building, and road-making, all that tends
to accumulate wealth or to advance material prosperity, has been
developed to an extent as great as it is unprecedented, and promises to
produce results which as yet can only be dimly guessed at.A great, and,
so far as we can see, an inevitable revolution, is pervading the whole
world through the devotion of the Aryan races to these arts.We have no
reason for supposing it will be otherwise than beneficial, however much
we may feel inclined to regret that the beautiful could not be allowed
to share a little of that worship so lavishly bestowed on the useful.It follows, as a matter of course, that, with minds so constituted, the
Aryans should have cultivated science with earnestness and success.The
only beauty they, in fact, appreciated was the beauty of scientific
truth; the only harmony they ever really felt was that of the laws of
nature; and the only art they ever cared to cultivate was that which
grouped these truths and their harmonies into forms which enabled them
to be easily grasped and appreciated.Mathematics always had especial
charms to the Aryan mind; and, more even than this, astronomy was always
captivating.So, also, were the mechanical, and so, too, the natural
sciences.It is to the Aryans that Induction owes its birth, and they
probably alone have the patience and the sobriety to work it to its
legitimate conclusions.The true mission of the Aryan races appears to be to pervade the world
with the useful and industrial arts, and so tend to reproduce that unity
which has long been lost, to raise man, not by magnifying his individual
cleverness, but by accumulating a knowledge of the works of God, so
tending to make him a greater and wiser, and at the same time a humbler
and a more religious servant of his Creator.When Auguste Comte proposed that classification which made the fortune
of his philosophy,—when he said that all mankind passed through the
theological state in childhood, the metaphysical in youth, and the
philosophical or positive in manhood,—and ventured to extend this
discovery to nations, he had a glimpse, as others have had before him,
of the beauty of the great harmony which pervades all created things.But he had not philosophy enough to see that the one great law is so
vast and so remote, that no human intellect can grasp it, and that it is
only the little fragments of that great scheme which are found
everywhere which man is permitted to understand.Had he known as much of ethnographical as he did of mathematical
science, he would have perceived that there is no warrant for this
daring generalisation; but that nations, in the states which he calls
the theological, the metaphysical, and the philosophical, exist now and
coexisted through all the ages of the world to which our historical
knowledge extends.What the Egyptians were when they first appeared on the scene they were
when they perished under the Greek and Roman sway;—what the Chinese
always were they now are;—the Jews and Arabs are unchanged to this
day;—the Celts are as daringly speculative and as blindly superstitious
now as we always found them;—and the Aryans of the Vedas or of Tacitus
were very much the same sober, reasoning, unimaginative, and unartistic
people as they are at this hour.Progress among men, as among the
animals, seems to be achieved not so much by advances made within the
limits of the group, as by the supercession of the less finely organised
beings by those of a higher class;—and this, so far as our knowledge
extends, is accomplished neither by successive creations, nor by the
gradual development of one species out of another, but by the successive
prominent appearances of previously developed, though partially dormant
creations.Ethnographers have already worked out this problem to a great extent,
and arrived at a very considerable degree of certainty, through the
researches of patient linguistic investigators.But language is in
itself too impalpable ever to give the science that tangible, local
reality which is necessary to its success; and it is here that
Archæology comes so opportunely to its aid.What men dug or built
remains where it was first placed, and probably retains the first
impressions it received: and so fixes the era and standing of those who
called it into existence; so that even those who cannot appreciate the
evidence derived from grammar or from words, may generally see at a
glance what the facts of the case really are.It is even more important that such a science as Ethnology should have
two or more methods of investigation at its command.Certainty can
hardly ever be attained by only one process, unless checked and
elucidated by others, and nothing can therefore be more fortunate than
the possession of so important a sister science as that of Archæology to
aid in the search after scientific truth.If Ethnology may thus be so largely indebted to Archæology, the converse
is also true; and she may pay back the debt with interest.As Archæology
and Architecture have hitherto been studied, they, but more especially
the latter, have been little more than a dry record of facts and
measurements, interesting to the antiquary, to the professional
architect, or to the tourist, who finds it necessary to get up a certain
amount of knowledge on the subject; but the utmost that has hitherto
been sought to be attained is a certain knowledge of the forms of the
art, while the study of it, as that of one of the most important and
most instructive of the sciences connected with the history of man, has
been as a rule neglected.Without this the study of Architecture is a mere record of bricks and
stones, and of the modes in which they were heaped together for man’s
use.Considered in the light of an historical record, it acquires not
only the dignity of a science, but especial interest as being one of
those sciences which are most closely connected with man’s interests and
feelings, and the one which more distinctly expresses and more clearly
records what man did and felt in previous ages, than any other study we
are acquainted with.From this point of view, not only every tomb and every temple, but even
the rude monoliths and mounds of savages, acquire a dignity and interest
to which they have otherwise no title; and man’s works become not only
man’s most imperishable record, but one of the best means we possess of
studying his history, or of understanding his nature or his aspirations.Rightly understood, Archæology is as useful as any other branch of
science or of art, in enabling us to catch such glimpses as are
vouchsafed to man of the great laws that govern all things; and the
knowledge that this class of man’s works is guided and governed by those
very laws, and not by the chance efforts of unmeaning minds, elevates
the study of it to as high a position as that of any other branch of
human knowledge.PART I.—ANCIENT ARCHITECTURE.So long as the geographer confines himself to mapping out the different
countries of the world, or smaller portions of the earth’s surface, he
finds no difficulty in making a projection which shall correctly
represent the exact relative position of all the various features of the
land or sea.But when he attempts to portray a continent, some
distortion necessarily results; and when he undertakes a hemisphere,
both distortion and exaggeration become inevitable.It has consequently
been found necessary to resort to some conventional means of portraying
the larger surfaces of the globe.These avowedly do not represent
correctly the forms of the countries portrayed, but they enable the
geographer to ascertain what their distances or relative positions are
by the application of certain rules and formulæ of no great complexity.So long as the narrative is confined
to individual countries or provinces, it may be perfectly consecutive
and uninterrupted; but when two or three nations are grouped together,
frequent interruptions and recapitulations become necessary; and when
universal history is attempted, it seems impossible to arrange the
narrative so as to prevent these from assuming very considerable
importance.The utmost that can be done is to devise some scheme which
shall prevent the repetition from leading to tediousness, and enable the
student to follow the thread of any portion of the narrative without
confusion or the assumption of any special previous knowledge on his
part.Bearing these difficulties in mind, it will probably be found convenient
to divide the whole history of Architecture into four great divisions or
parts.The first, which may be called “Ancient or Heathen Art,” to comprehend
all those styles which prevailed in the old world from the dawn of
history in Egypt till the disruption of the Roman Empire by the removal
of the capital from Rome to Constantinople in the 4th century.The second to be called either “Mediæval,” or more properly “Christian
Art.” This again subdivides itself into three easily-understood
divisions.The
Romanesque or transitional style which prevailed between the Roman and
the Gothic styles; and 3.The
Byzantine style comes first because its development was so rapid that
already in the 6th century it had reached its culminating period, and
throughout the Middle Ages it exercised considerable influence in
various parts of Italy and France; an influence the extent of which it
is only possible to follow after its study.It is difficult, for
instance, to understand the churches in Ravenna or St.Mark’s in Venice,
or the churches at Périgueux, and in the Charente, until the churches of
Sta.Sergius, Constantinople, and of St.Demetrius,
Thessalonica, have been studied; and although it is advisable when
describing the style to carry it through its later developments in
Greece, in Russia, and in the East, these variations and developments
are not of a nature to distract the reader or cause him to lose sight of
the leading characteristics of the style.There is some difficulty in
knowing where to draw the line between the Romanesque and the Gothic
style; as generally accepted now, the term Romanesque includes all the
round-arched Gothic styles, and although many of the leading principles
of Gothic work are to be found entering into buildings constructed prior
to the introduction of the pointed arch into transverse and diagonal
ribbed arch vaulting, it was this latter which led to the great
development of the Gothic style in France, England, and elsewhere in the
12th and 13th centuries.The third great division of the subject I would suggest might
conveniently be denominated “Pagan.”[21] It would comprise all those
minor miscellaneous styles not included in the two previous divisions.Commencing with the Saracenic, it would include the Buddhist, Hindu, and
Chinese styles, the Mexican and Peruvian, and lastly that mysterious
group which for want of a better name I have elsewhere designated as
“Rude Stone Monuments.”[22] No very consecutive arrangement can be
formed for these styles.They generally have little connection with each
other, and are so much less important than the others that their mode of
treatment is of far less consequence.Nor is it necessary to attempt any
exact classification of these at present, as, owing to the convenience
of publication, it has been determined to form the Indian and allied
Eastern styles into a separate volume, which will include not only the
Buddhist and Hindu styles, but the Indian Saracenic, which, in a
strictly logical arrangement, ought to be classified with the western
style bearing the same name.The styles of the New world, having as yet no acknowledged connection
with those of the Old, may be for the present treated of anywhere.The fourth and last great division, forming the fourth volume of the
present work, is that of the “Modern or Copying Styles of Architecture,”
meaning thereby those which are the products of the renaissance of the
classical styles that marked the epoch of the cinquecento period.These
have since that time prevailed generally in Europe to the present day,
and are now making the tour of the world.Within the limits of the
present century it is true that the copying of the classical styles to
some extent were superseded by a more servile imitation of those of
mediæval art.The forms consequently changed, but the principles
remained the same.It would of course be easy to point out minor objections to this or to
any scheme, but on the whole it will be found to meet the exigencies of
the case as we now know it, as well or perhaps better than any other.The greatest difficulty in carrying it out is to ascertain how far the
geographical arrangement should be made to supersede the chronological
and ethnographical.Whether, for instance, Italy should be considered as
a whole, or if the buildings of the eastern coast should not be
described as belonging to the Byzantine, and those of the western coast
to the Gothic kingdom?Whether the description of the Temple at
Jerusalem should stop short with the rebuilding by Zorobabel, or be
continued till its final completion under Herod?If the former course is
pursued, we cut in two a perfectly consecutive narrative; if the latter,
we get far in advance of our chronological sequence.In both of these instances, as in many others, it is a choice of
difficulties, and where frequently the least strictly logical mode of
proceeding may be found the most convenient.After all, the real difficulty lies not so much in arranging the
materials as in weighing the relative importance to be assigned to each
division.In wandering over so vast a field it is difficult to prevent
personal predilection from interfering with purely logical criticism.Although architecture is the most mechanical of the fine arts, and
consequently the most amenable to scientific treatment, still as a fine
art it must be felt to be appreciated, and when the feelings come into
play the reason is sometimes in danger.Though strict impartiality has
been aimed at in assigning the true limits to each of the divisions
above pointed out, few probably will be of the same opinion as to the
degree of success which has been achieved in the attempt.OUTLINE OF EGYPTIAN CHRONOLOGY.ACCORDING TO MANETHO AND THE MONUMENTS.OLD KINGDOM OF PYRAMID BUILDERS.1st dynasty Thinite        252    Accession of Menes, 1st king.3906

                                BOOK I.

                         EGYPTIAN ARCHITECTURE.CHAPTER I.

                             INTRODUCTORY.In any consecutive narrative of the architectural undertakings of
mankind the description of what was done in Egypt necessarily commences
the series, not only because the records of authentic history are found
in the Valley of the Nile long before the traditions of other nations
had assumed anything like tangible consistency, but because, from the
earliest dawn down to the time when Christianity struck down the old
idolatry, the inhabitants of that mysterious land were essentially and
pre-eminently a building race.Were it not for this we should be left
with the dry bones of the skeleton of her history, which is all that is
left us of the dynasties of Manetho; or with the fables in which
ignorant and credulous European travellers expressed their wonder at a
civilisation they could not comprehend.As the case now stands, the monuments of Egypt give life and reality to
their whole history.It is impossible for any educated man capable of
judging of the value of evidence to wander among the Pyramids and tombs
of Memphis, the Temples of Thebes, or the vast structures erected by the
Ptolemys or Cæsars, and not to feel that he has before him a chapter of
history more authentic than we possess of any nation at all approaching
it in antiquity, and a picture of men and manners more vivid and more
ample than remains to us of any other people who have passed away.As we wander among the tombs or temples of Egypt we see the very
chisel-marks of the mason, and the actual colours of the painter which
were ordered by a Khufu, or a Rameses, and we stand face to face with
works the progress of which they watched, and which they designed in
order to convey to posterity what their thoughts and feelings were, and
what they desired to record for the instruction of future generations.All is there now, and all who care may learn what these old kings
intended should be known by their remotest posterity.Immense progress has been made in unravelling the intricacies of
Egyptian history since the time when Champollion, profiting by the
discovery of Young, first translated the hieroglyphical inscriptions
that cover the walls of Egyptian buildings.Of late years it has been
too frequently assumed that his works, with those of Rosellini, of
Wilkinson, and Lepsius, and the numerous other authors who have applied
themselves to Egyptology, had told us all we are ever likely to know of
her history.In so far as the epochs of the great Pharaonic dynasties of
Thebes are concerned this may be partially true, but it is only since M.
Mariette undertook the systematic exploration of the great Necropolis of
Memphis that we have been enabled to realise the importance of the older
dynasties, and become aware of the completeness of the records they have
left behind them.Much as we have learned during the last fifty years,
the recent explorations of Maspero, W. M. Flinders Petrie and others
have taught us that the soil of Egypt is not half exhausted yet; and
every day our knowledge is assuming a consistency and completeness as
satisfactory as it is wonderful.Although there are still minor differences of opinion with regard to the
details of Egyptian chronology, still the divergences between the
various systems proposed are gradually narrowing in extent.The sequence
of events is certain, and accepted by all.The initial date, and the
adjustments depending on it, are alone in dispute.The truth is that
every subsequent step in the investigation has tended more and more to
prove the correctness of the data furnished by the lists of Manetho, and
the only important question is, “what is Manetho?” His work is lost.The
only real extracts we have from the original are those in ‘Josephus
contra Apion.’ The lists in Eusebius and Syncellus or Africanus have
avowedly been adjusted to suit preconceived theories of Biblical
chronology; but on the whole a great preponderance of evidence seems in
favour of assuming that he really intended to fix the year 3906 as the
initial year of the reign of Menes,[24] or some year within a very short
distance of that date.Some years ago this would have seemed to suffice,
but so many new monuments have been disinterred of late, so many new
names of kings added to our lists, that the tendency is now rather to
extend than to contract this limit of duration.Be this as it may, what we really do know absolutely is that there was
an old kingdom of pyramid-builders, comprising the first ten dynasties
of Manetho, who reigned at Memphis.These, after a period of decadence,
were superseded by kings of a different race coming from the south; and
that these, after a short period of glory, were conquered by an Asiatic
race of hated Shepherd kings.After five centuries of foreign domination, the Shepherds in their turn
were driven out, and the new kingdom founded.This, after witnessing the
glories of the 18th and 19th dynasties, declined during the next seven
dynasties till they were struck down by the Persian Cambyses.A third period of architectural magnificence arose with the Ptolemys,
and was continued by the Cæsars on nearly the same scale of magnificence
as the second kingdom; but wanting its exuberant nationality, and far
below the quiet grandeur of the earlier epoch.In counting backwards the dates of these dynasties, the first authentic
synchronism we meet with is that of Shishak, the first king of the 22nd
dynasty, contemporary with Rehoboam, about 970 B.C.The next is the Exode of the Jews, which took place 1312 B.C., under the
reign of Meneptah II., the fourth king of the 19th dynasty of Manetho.Many would place it earlier, but none probably would bring that event
down to a more modern date.From this date Josephus tells us that Manetho counted 518 years to the
expulsion of the Shepherds, and 511 for the duration of their sojourn in
Egypt,[25] we thus get back to 2340 for the first year of Salatis.There
then remain only fifteen centuries and a half, in which we have to
arrange the two great Theban dynasties (the 11th and 12th), which
reigned for more than two centuries over the whole of Egypt; while the
12th seems to have extended some distance into the period occupied by
the Shepherds.We are thus left with little more than 1300 years over
which to spread the ten first dynasties, notwithstanding that some 60 or
70 of their royal sepulchral pyramids still adorn the banks of the Nile;
and we have many names to which no tombs can be attached, and many
pyramids may have perished during the 5000 years which have elapsed
since the greater number of them were erected.Long as these periods may to some appear, they are certainly the
shortest that any one familiar with the recent progress of Egyptian
research would be willing to assign to them.But in whatever light they
may be viewed, they sink into utter insignificance when compared with
the periods that must have elapsed before Egypt could have reached that
stage of civilisation in which we find her when her existence first
dawns upon us.If one point in Egyptian history is proved with more
certainty than another, it is that the great Pyramids of Gizeh were
erected by the kings of the 4th dynasty: and it seems impossible to find
room for the now ascertained facts of Egyptian chronology, unless we
place their erection between 3000 and 3500 years before the Christian
era.No one can possibly examine the interior of the Great Pyramid without
being struck with astonishment at the wonderful mechanical skill
displayed in its construction.The immense blocks of granite brought
from Syene—a distance of 500 miles—polished like glass, and so fitted
that the joints can hardly be detected.Nothing can be more wonderful
than the extraordinary amount of knowledge displayed in the construction
of the discharging chambers over the roof of the principal apartment, in
the alignment of the sloping galleries, in the provision of ventilating
shafts, and in all the wonderful contrivances of the structure.All
these, too, are carried out with such precision, that, notwithstanding
the immense superincumbent weight, no settlement in any part can be
detected to the extent of an appreciable fraction of an inch.Nothing
more perfect, mechanically, has ever been erected since that time; and
we ask ourselves in vain, how long it must have taken before men
acquired such experience and such skill, or were so perfectly organised,
as to contemplate and complete such undertakings.Around the base of the pyramid are found numerous structural tombs,
whose walls bear the cartouche of the same king—Khufu—whose name was
found by Colonel Howard Vyse in one of the previously unopened chambers
of the Great Pyramid.[26] These are adorned with paintings so numerous
and so complete, as to enable us to realise with singular completeness
the state of Egyptian society at that early period.On their walls the owner of the tomb is usually represented seated,
offering first fruits on a simple table-altar to an unseen god.He is
generally accompanied by his wife, and surrounded by his stewards and
servants, who enumerate his wealth in horned cattle, in asses, in sheep
and goats, in geese and ducks.In other pictures some are ploughing and
sowing, some reaping or thrashing out the corn, while others are tending
his tame monkeys or cranes, and other domesticated pets.Music and
dancing add to the circle of domestic enjoyments, and fowling and
fishing occupy his days of leisure.No sign of soldiers or of warlike
strife appears in any of these pictures; no arms, no chariots or horses.Everything there represented speaks of
peace at home and abroad,[27] of agricultural wealth and consequent
content.In all these pictures the men are represented with an ethnic
and artistic truth that enables us easily to recognise their race and
station.The animals are not only easily distinguishable, but the
characteristic peculiarities of each species are seized with a power of
generalisation seldom if ever surpassed; and the hieroglyphic system
which forms the legend and explains the whole, was as complete and
perfect then as at any future period.More striking than even the paintings are the portrait-statues which
have recently been discovered in the secret recesses of these tombs;
nothing more wonderfully truthful and realistic has been done since that
time, till the invention of photography, and even that can hardly
represent a man with such unflattering truthfulness as these old
 terra-cotta portraits of the sleek rich men of the pyramid
period.Wonderful as all this maturity of art may be when found at so early a
period, the problem becomes still more perplexing when we again ask
ourselves how long a people must have lived and recorded their
experience before they came to realise and aspire to an eternity such as
the building of these pyramids shows that they sacrificed everything to
attain.One of their great aims was to preserve the body intact for 3000
years, in order that the soul might again be united with it when the day
of judgment arrived.But what taught them to contemplate such periods of
time with confidence, and, stranger still, how did they learn to realise
so daring an aspiration?Nor is our wonder less when we ask ourselves how it happened that such a
people became so thoroughly organised at that early age as to be willing
to undertake the greatest architectural works the world has since seen
in honour of one man from among themselves?A king without an army, and
with no claim, so far as we can see, to such an honour beyond the common
consent of all, which could hardly have been obtained except by the
title of long inherited services acknowledged by the community at large.It would be difficult to find any other example which so fully
illustrates the value of architecture as a mode of writing history as
this.It is possible there may have been nations as old and as early
civilised as the Egyptians: but they were not builders, and their memory
is lost.It is to their architecture alone that we owe the preservation
of what we know of this old people.And it is the knowledge so obtained
that adds such interest to the study of their art.In the present state of our knowledge it may seem an idle speculation to
suggest that the Egyptian and Chinese are two fragments of one great
primordial race, widely separated now by the irruption of other Turanian
and Aryan races between them; but this at least is certain, that in
manners and customs, in arts and polity, in religion and civilisation,
these two peoples more closely resemble one another than any other two
nations which have existed since, even when avowedly of similar race and
living in proximity to one another.At the earliest period at which Chinese history opens upon us, we find
the same amount of civilisation maintaining itself utterly
unprogressively to the present day.The same peaceful industry and
agricultural wealth accompanied by the same outwardly pleasing domestic
relations and apparent content.The same want of power to assimilate with surrounding nations.Both
hating war, but reverencing their kings, and counting their chronology
by dynasties exactly as the Egyptians have always done.Their religions
seem wonderfully alike, and both are characterised by the same
fearlessness of death, and the same calm enjoyment in the contemplation
of its advent.[28]

In fact there is no peculiarity in the old kingdom of Egypt that has not
its counterpart in China at the present day, though more or less
modified, perhaps, by local circumstances; and there is nothing in the
older system which we cannot understand by using proper illustrations,
derived from what we see passing under our immediate observation in the
far East.The great lesson we learn from the study of the history of
China as bearing on that of Egypt is, that all idea of the impossibility
of the recorded events in the latter country is taken away by reference
to the other.Neither the duration of the Egyptian dynasties, nor the
early perfection of her civilisation, or its strange persistency, can be
objected to as improbable.What we know has happened in Asia in modern
times may certainly have taken place in Africa, though at an earlier
period.THE PYRAMIDS AND CONTEMPORARY MONUMENTS.Leaving these speculations to be developed more fully in the sequel, let
us now turn to the pyramids—the oldest, largest, and most mysterious of
all the monuments of man’s art now existing.All those in Egypt are
situated on the left bank of the Nile, just beyond the cultivated
ground, and on the edge of the desert, and all the principal examples
within what may fairly be called the Necropolis of Memphis.Sixty or
seventy of these have been discovered and explored, all which appear to
be royal sepulchres.This alone, if true would suffice to justify us in
assigning a duration of 1000 years at least to the dynasties of the
pyramid builders, and this is about the date we acquire from other
sources.The three great pyramids of Gizeh are the most remarkable and the best
known of all those of Egypt.Of these the first, erected by Cheops, or,
as he is now more correctly named, Khufu, is the largest; but the next,
by Chephren (Khafra), his successor, is scarcely inferior in dimensions;
the third, that of Mycerinus (Menkaura), is very much smaller, but
excelled the two others in this, that it had a coating of beautiful red
granite from Syene, while the other two were revêted only with the
beautiful limestone of the country.Part of this coating still remains
near the top of the second; and Colonel Vyse[29] was fortunate enough to
discover some of the coping-stones of the Great Pyramid buried in the
rubbish at its base.These are sufficient to indicate the nature and
extent of the whole, and to show that it was commenced from the bottom
and carried upwards; not at the top, as it has sometimes been
thoughtlessly asserted.[30]

[Illustration: No.Since Colonel Vyse’s discovery, however, further casing-stones have been
found in situ by Mr.Flinders Petrie, whose measurements, taken in
1880-82, and published in the following year,[31] are the most accurate
yet made.The dimensions hitherto given have shown a difference of as
much as eighteen inches in the length of the sides, which, if the
pyramid had been set out on a perfectly clear level ground, would have
detracted from the perfection which has been claimed for its setting
out.This difference, however, it appears now, was due to the fact that
the various observers had measured from angle to angle of the corner
sockets, and had “assumed that the faces of the stones placed in them
rose up vertically from the edge of the bottom until they reached the
pavement (whatever level that might be), from which the sloping face
started upwards.” This, however, was not the case; the sloping sides of
the Pyramid continued down to the rock surface, and the base was
eventually partially covered over by a level pavement or platform;[32]
the parts covered over varying in extent according to the depth they
were carried down.Petrie utilized the angle sockets for the purpose
of obtaining the true diagonals of the casing, and having computed a
square which passed through the points of casing found on each side, and
having also its corners lying on the diagonals of the sockets, obtained
the dimensions of the original base of the Great Pyramid casing on the
artificial platform or pavement, which was as follows:—

                                Sq.North side  9069·4 or 755 9·4
                     East side   9067·7 or 755 7·7
                     South side  9069·5 or 755 8·6
                     West side   9068·6 or 755 8·8

The mean being 755 ft.8·8 in., and the extreme difference being 1·7 of
an inch only.The actual height of the Great Pyramid from level of platform was 481
ft.4 in., and the angle of casing 51° 52ʺ.In the Second Pyramid, the bottom corner of casing (which was in
granite) had a vertical base 10 or 12 in.high, against which the
pavement was laid; and the following were the dimensions obtained:—

                                Sq.North side  8471·9 or 705 11·9
                     East side   8475·2 or 706 3·2
                     South side  8476·9 or 706 4·9
                     West side   8475·5 or 706 3·5

The mean being 706 ft.2·9 in., and the extreme difference in the length
of side 5 in.The height was 472 ft., and the angle of casing 53° 10ʹ.The Third Pyramid was never quite finished, and there is some difficulty
in determining the exact level of platform.The mean length of the sides
was calculated by Mr.1·6 in., its height 215 ft., and
the angle of its casing 51° 10ʹ.From this it will be seen that the area of the Great Pyramid (more than
13 acres) is more than twice the extent of that of St.Peter’s at Rome,
or of any other building in the world.[33] Its height is equal to the
highest spire of any cathedral in Europe; for, though it has been
attempted to erect higher buildings, in no instance has this yet been
successfully achieved.Even the Third Pyramid covers more ground than
any Gothic cathedral, and the mass of materials it contains far
surpasses that of any erection we possess in Europe.All the pyramids (with one exception) face exactly north, and have their
entrance on that side—a circumstance the more remarkable, as the later
builders of Thebes appear to have had no notion of orientation, but to
have placed their buildings and tombs so as to avoid regularity, and
facing in every conceivable direction.Instead of the entrances to the
pyramids being level, they all <DW72> downwards—generally at angles of
about 26° to the horizon—a circumstance which has led to an infinity of
speculation, as to whether they were not observatories, and meant for
the observation of the pole-star, &c.[34] All these theories, however,
have failed, for a variety of reasons it is needless now to discuss; but
among others it may be mentioned that the angles are not the same in any
two pyramids, though erected within a few years of one another, and in
the twenty which were measured by Colonel Vyse they vary from 22° 35ʹ to
34° 5ʹ.The angle of the inclination of the side of the pyramid to the
horizon is more constant, varying only from 51° 10ʹ to 52° 32ʹ, and in
the Gizeh pyramid it would appear that the angle of the passage was
intended to have been about one-half of this.Petrie gives a synopsis of the various theories connected with the
Great Pyramid, which applies not only to the outside form but to the
several chambers and passages in the interior.“There are three great
lines of theory,” he says,[35] “throughout the Pyramid, each of which
must stand or fall as a whole, they are scarcely contradictory, and may
almost subsist together;” these are (1) the Egyptian cubit (20·62 in.)theory; (2) the π proportion or radius and circumference theory; (3) the
theory of areas, squares of lengths and diagonals.Of the two first, and applying these only to the exterior by the cubit
theory, the outside form of pyramid is 280 cubits high and 440 cubits
length of side, or 7 in height to 11 of width.This is confirmed by the
π theory, where we get the very common proportion that the height is to
the circumference as the radius is to the circumference of a circle
inscribed within its base; thus taking the mean height of 481 ft.4 in.,
we have 481·33 × 2 × 3·1416 = 3024, whilst the side 755·75 × 4 = 3023,
so near a coincidence that it can hardly be accidental, and if it was
intended, all the other external proportions follow as a matter of
course.Even if this theory should not be accepted as the true one, it has at
least the merit of being nearer the truth than any other yet proposed.I
confess it appears to me so likely that I would hardly care to go
further, especially as all the astronomical theories have signally
failed, and it seems as if it were only to some numerical fancy that we
must look for a solution of the puzzle.Be this as it may, the small residuum we get from all these pyramid
discussions is, that they were built by the kings of the early dynasties
of the old kingdom of Egypt as their tombs.The leading idea that
governed their forms was that of durability—a quasi-eternity of duration
is what they aimed at.The entrances were meant to be concealed, and the
angle of the passages was the limit of rest at which heavy bodies could
be moved while obtaining the necessary strength where they opened at the
outside, and the necessary difficulty for protection inside, without
trenching on impossibility.By concealment of the entrance, the
difficulties of the passages, and the complicated but most ingenious
arrangement of portcullises, these ancient kings hoped to be allowed to
rest in undisturbed security for at least 3000 years.Perhaps they were
successful, though their tombs have since been so shamefully profaned.To the principal dimensions of the Great Pyramid given above, it may be
added that the entrance is 55 ft.above the base, on the 19th
course, which is deeper than the 11 to 14 courses above and below; at
present there remain 203 courses, to which must be added 12 to 14
missing.6 in., but they diminish
in height—generally speaking, but not uniformly—towards the top.The
summit now consists of a platform 32 ft.is wanting, the present actual height being 454 ft.It contains two
chambers above-ground, and one cut in the rock at a considerable depth
below the foundations.The passages and chambers are worthy of the mass; all are lined with
polished granite; and the ingenuity and pains that have been taken to
render them solid and secure, and to prevent their being crushed by the
superincumbent mass, raise our idea of Egyptian science higher than even
the bulk of the building itself could do.Section of King’s Chamber and of Passage in
  Great Pyramid.Towards the exterior, where the pressure is not great, the roof is flat,
though it is probable that even there the weight is throughout
discharged by 2 stones, sloping up at a certain angle to where they
meet, as at the entrance.Towards the centre of the pyramid, however,
the passage becomes 28 feet high, the 7 upper courses of stone
overhanging one another as shown in the annexed section (fig.1), so as
to reduce the bearing of the covering stone.Nowhere, however, is this
ingenuity more shown than in the royal chamber, which measures 17 ft.The walls are lined and the
roof is formed of splendid slabs of Syenite, but above the roof 4
successive chambers, as shown in the annexed section (fig.2), have been
formed, each divided from the other by slabs of granite, polished on
their lower surfaces, but left rough on the upper, and above these a 5th
chamber is formed of 2 sloping blocks to discharge the weight of the
whole.The first of these chambers has long been known; the upper four
were discovered and first entered by Colonel Vyse, and it was in one of
these that he discovered the name of the founder.This was not engraved
as a record, but scribbled in red paint on the stones, apparently as a
quarrymark, or as an address to the king, and accompanied by something
like directions for their position in the building.The interest that
attaches to these inscriptions consists in the certainty of their being
contemporary records, in their proving that Khufu was the founder of the
Great Pyramid, and consequently fixing its relative date beyond all
possibility of cavil.This is the only really virgin discovery in the
pyramids, as they have all been opened either in the time of the Greeks
or Romans, or by the Mahometans, and an unrifled tomb of this age is
still a desideratum.Until such is hit upon we must remain in ignorance
of the real mode of sepulture in those days, and of the purpose of many
of the arrangements in these mysterious buildings.The portcullises which invariably close the entrances of the sepulchral
chamber in the pyramids are among the most curious and ingenious of the
arrangements of these buildings.Generally they consist of great cubical
masses of granite, measuring 8 or 10 ft.each way, and consequently
weighing 50 or 60 tons, and even more.These were fitted into chambers
prepared during the construction of the building, but raised into the
upper parts, and, being lowered after the body was deposited, closed the
entrance so effectually that in some instances it has been found
necessary either to break them in pieces, or to cut a passage round
them, to gain admission to the chambers.They generally slide in grooves
in the wall, to which they fit exactly, and altogether show a degree of
ingenuity and forethought very remarkable, considering the early age at
which they were executed.In the Second Pyramid one chamber has been discovered partly
above-ground, partly cut in the rock.In the Third the chambers are
numerous, all excavated in the rock; and from the tunnels that have been
driven by explorers through the superstructures of these two, it is very
doubtful whether anything is to be found above-ground.[36]

All the old pyramids do not follow the simple outline of those at Gizeh.That at Dahshur, for instance, rises to half the height, with a <DW72> of
54° to the horizon, but is finished at the angle of 45°, giving it a
very exceptional appearance.The pyramids of Sakkara and Medum are of
the class known as mastaba pyramids, the term mastaba (Arabic for bench)
being given to the sloping-sided tombs of about 76° angle and from 10 to
20 ft.(From Colonel Vyse’s work.)The annexed plan and section of Sakkara (Woodcut Nos.9 and 10), both to
the scale of 100 ft.to 1 in., show the peculiar nature of their
construction, which seems to have been cumulative; that is to say, they
have been enlarged in successive periods, the original casing of the
earlier portions having been traced.Petrie says: “Both of these
structures have been several times finished, each time with a
close-jointed polished casing of the finest white limestone, and then,
after each completion, it has been again enlarged by another coat of
rough masonry and another line casing outside.”

These two pyramids are the only two genuine stepped pyramids, all the
others having had an uniform casing on one <DW72> (excepting Dahshur, as
above mentioned).The Pyramid of Sakkara is the only pyramid that does
not face exactly north and south.It is nearly of the same general
dimensions as the Third Pyramid, that of Mycerinus; but its outline, the
disposition of its chambers, and the hieroglyphics found in its
interior, all would seem to point it out as an imitation of the older
form of mausolea by some king of a far more modern date.Flinders Petrie’s discoveries in 1891 determined the age and the
construction of the Pyramid of Medum,[37] erected by Seneferu, a king of
the third dynasty, being therefore the oldest pyramid known.Its
construction resembles that of the small pyramid of Rikheh and the
oblong step pyramid of Sakkara, that is to say, it is a cumulative
mastaba, the primal mastaba being about 150 ft.square, and from 37 to
45 ft.The outer coatings added were seven in number, and the
original mass was carried up and heightened as the circuit was
increased, and lastly an outer casing covered over all the steps which
had resulted during the construction.The average length of the base was
473 ft.6 in., the total height being 301 ft.Petrie, the Pyramid of Medum, as those of Sakkara and Rikheh, were of a
transitional form, in which the original mastaba had been greatly
enlarged and subsequently covered over with a casing of pyramidal
outline.“That type once arrived at, there was no need for subsequent
kings to retain the mastaba form internally, and Khufu and his
successors laid out their pyramids of full size at first and built them
up at an angle of 51°, and not at 75°, that which is found in the
ordinary mastabas.” Mr.Petrie also discovered the temple of the pyramid
in the middle of its east side, and almost uninjured.It consisted of a
passage entered at the south end of east front, then a small chamber and
a courtyard adjoining the side of the pyramid, containing two steles and
one altar between them.In the sepulchral pit of Rahotep, near the pyramid, Mr.Petrie found two
arches thrown across a passage to relieve the thrust of the overlapping
sides, which carries the use of that feature back to the 4th dynasty.Around the Pyramids from Abouraash, north of Gizeh to Medum, south of
Sakkara, a distance of over 15 miles, forming the Necropolis of Memphis,
numberless smaller sepulchres are found, which appear to have been
appropriated to private individuals, as the pyramids were—so far as we
can ascertain—reserved for kings, or, at all events, for persons of
royal blood.These tombs are now known under the term of mastabas, to
which we have already referred.The mastaba is a rectangular building
varying in size from 15 to 150 ft.in width and length, and from 10 to
80 ft.Their general form is that of a truncated pyramid with
an angle of 75° to the horizon, low, and looking exceedingly like a
house with sloping walls, with only one door leading to the interior,
though they may contain several apartments, and no attempt is made to
conceal the entrance.The chambers consist (1) of reception rooms and
(2) of serdabs, which are closed cells containing the terra-cotta
statuettes which represent the Ka’s or doubles of the deceased.These
chambers occupy a part only of the mastaba, the remainder being solid
masonry or brickwork.The body seems to have been hidden from
profanation by being hid in a pit sunk in the rock, the entrance to
which was concealed, and could be approached only through the solid core
of the mastaba.Unlike the pyramids, the walls are covered with the paintings above
alluded to, and everything in this “eternal dwelling”[38] of the dead is
made to resemble the abodes of the living; as was afterwards the case
with the Etruscans.It is owing to this circumstance that we are able
not only to realise so perfectly the civil life of the Egyptians at this
period, but to fix the dates of the whole series by identifying the
names of the kings who built the pyramids with those on the walls of the
tombs that surround them.[39]

Like all early architecture, that of these tombs shows evident symptoms
of having been borrowed from a wooden original.The lintels of the
doorways are generally rounded, and the walls mere square posts, grooved
and jointed together, every part of it being as unlike a stone
architecture as can possibly be conceived.Yet the pyramids themselves,
and those tombs which are found outside them, are generally far removed
from the forms employed in timber structures; and it is only when we
find the Egyptians indulging in decorative art that we trace this more
primitive style.There are two doorways of this class in the British
Museum and many in that of Berlin.One engraved in Lepsius’s work
(Woodcut No.11) gives a fair idea of this style of decorative art, in
the most elaborate form in which we now know it.It is possible that
some of its forms may have been derived from brick architecture, but the
lintel certainly was of wood, and so it may be suspected were the
majority of its features.It certainly is a transitional form, and
though we only find it in stone, none of its peculiarities were derived
from lithic arts.Perhaps one of the best illustrations of the
architectural forms of that day was the sarcophagus of Mycerinus,
unfortunately lost on its way to England.It represented a palace, with
all the peculiarities found on a larger scale in the buildings which
surround the pyramid, and with that peculiar cornice and still more
singular roll or ligature on the angles, most evidently a carpentry
form, but which the style retained to its latest day.Doorway in Tomb at the Pyramids.Sarcophagus of Mycerinus, found in Third Pyramid.]In many of these tombs square piers are found supporting the roofs
sometimes, but rarely, with an abacus, and generally without any carved
work, though it is more than probable they were originally painted with
some device, upon which they depended for their ornament.In most
instances they look more like fragments of a wall, of which the
intervening spaces had been cut away, than pillars in the sense in which
we usually understand the word; and in every case in the early ages they
must be looked upon more as utilitarian expedients than as parts of an
ornamental style of architecture.Till recently no temples had been discovered which could with certainty
be ascribed to the age of the pyramid builders; one, however, was
excavated in 1853, from the sand close beside the great Sphinx, with
which it was thought at one time to have been connected.Petrie,
however, found the remains of a causeway 15 ft.wide and over a quarter
of a mile long, leading to a second temple in front of the pyramid of
Khafra; as also the traces of other temples in front of the Great
Pyramid and of that of Menkaura.Further temples have been discovered at
Abouseer, Dahshur and other pyramids, so that, as Mr.209, “to understand the purpose of the erection of the Pyramids it
should be observed that each has a temple on the eastern side of it.Of
the temples of the second and third Pyramids the ruins still remain; and
of the temple of the Great Pyramid the basalt pavement and numerous
blocks of granite show its site.” “The worship of the deified king was
carried on in the temple, looking toward the Pyramid which stood on the
west of it; just as private individuals worshipped their ancestors in
the family tombs” (already referred to) “looking towards the false
doors[40] which are placed in the west side of the tomb, and which
represent the entrances to the hidden sepulchres.”

[Illustration: 13.The temple of the Sphinx,[41] (or, as it is now called, the granite
temple,) though at present almost buried, was apparently a free-standing
building, a mass of masonry, the outer surfaces of which were built in
limestone, and carved with long grooves, horizontal and vertical,
skilfully crossed, resembling therefore the carved fronts of many tombs
at Sakkara and Gizeh and the sarcophagus of Mycerinus (Woodcut No.in each direction, and the walls were 40 ft.It was arranged in two storeys, the upper one being an open court.In the lower storey were: A, a hall 55 ft.high, with two rows of massive granite piers supporting beams
of the same material to carry the stone roof: B, a second hall into
which the first hall opened, and at right angles to it, measuring 81 ft.high, with one row of granite piers down
the centre; both of these being lighted by narrow slits just below the
granite roof:[42] C, a side chamber with six loculi, in two levels, each
19 ft.long: D, a sloping passage lined with granite and oriental
alabaster, leading to the causeway which placed it in communication with
the Second Pyramid, and: E, a hall 60 ft.high (rising therefore above the pavement of the upper court), with a
large recess at each end containing a statue.These recesses were high
above doors which led to smaller chambers also containing statues.The internal walls were lined with immense blocks of granite from Syene
and of alabaster beautifully polished, but with sloping joints and
uneven beds, a form of masonry not unknown in that age.No sculpture or
inscription of any sort is found on the walls of the temple,[43] or
ornament or symbol in the sanctuary.Statues and tablets of Khafra, the
builder of the Second Pyramid, were found in the well, and this, and the
fact that the causeway extended to the temple in front of his pyramid,
shows clearly that it belonged to his time.[44]


In the present transitional state of our knowledge of the architectural
art of the pyramid builders, it is difficult to form any distinct
judgment as to its merits.The early Egyptians built neither for beauty
nor for use, but for eternity, and to this last they sacrificed every
other feeling.In itself nothing can be less artistic than a pyramid.A
tower, either round or square, or of any other form, and of the same
dimensions, would have been far more imposing, and if of sufficient
height—the mass being the same—might almost have attained sublimity; but
a pyramid never looks so large as it is, and not till you almost touch
it can you realise its vast dimensions.This is owing principally to all
its parts sloping away from the eye instead of boldly challenging
observation; but, on the other hand, no form is so stable, none so
capable of resisting the injuries of time or force, and none,
consequently, so well calculated to attain the object for which the
pyramids were erected.As examples of technic art, they are unrivalled
among the works of men, but they rank low if judged by the æsthetic
rules of architectural art.The same may be said of the tombs around them: they are low and solid,
but possess neither beauty of form nor any architectural feature worthy
of attention or admiration, but they have lasted nearly uninjured from
the remotest antiquity, and thus have attained the object their builders
had principally in view in designing them.Their temple architecture, on the other hand, may induce us to modify
considerably these opinions.The one described above—which is the only
one I personally have any knowledge of—is perhaps the simplest and least
adorned temple in the world.All its parts are plain—straight and
square, without a single moulding of any sort, but they are perfectly
proportioned to the work they have to do.They are pleasingly and
effectively arranged, and they have all that lithic grandeur which is
inherent in large masses of precious materials.Such a temple as that near the Sphinx cannot compete either in richness
or magnificence with the great temples of Thebes, with their sculptured
capitals and storied walls, but there is a beauty of repose and an
elegance of simplicity about the older example which goes far to redeem
its other deficiencies, and when we have more examples before us they
may rise still higher in our estimation.Whatever opinion we may ultimately form regarding their architecture,
there can be little doubt as to the rank to be assigned to their
painting and sculpture.In these two arts the Egyptians early attained a
mastery which they never surpassed.Judged by the rules of classic or of
modern art, it appears formal and conventional to such an extent as to
render it difficult for us now to appreciate its merits.But as a purely
Phonetic form of art—as used merely to enunciate those ideas which we
now so much more easily express by alphabetic writings—it is clear and
precise beyond any picture-writings the world has since seen.Judged by
its own rules, it is marvellous to what perfection the Egyptians had
attained at that early period, and if we look on their minor edifices as
mere vehicles for the display of this pictorial expression, we must
modify to some extent the judgment we would pass on them as mere objects
of architectural art.XITH AND XIITH DYNASTY OF MANETHO.Sankhkara                 reigned 46 years.Amenemhat                 reigned 38 years.Osirtasen                 reigned 48 years.(Lampares) reigned  8 years.His successors            reigned 42 years.The great culminating period of the old kingdom of Egypt is that
belonging to the 4th and 5th dynasties.Nine-tenths of the monuments of
the pyramid-builders which have come down to our time belong to the five
centuries during which these two dynasties ruled over Egypt (B.C.The 6th dynasty was of a southern and more purely African origin.On the
tablets of Apap[45] (Apophis), its most famous monarch, we find the
worship of Khem and other deities of the Theban period wholly unknown to
the pyramid kings.The next four dynasties are of _fainéant_ kings, of
whom we know little, not “Carent quia vate sacro,” but because they were
not builders, and their memory is lost.The 11th and 12th usher in a new
state of affairs.The old Memphite pyramid-building kingdom had passed,
with its peaceful contentment, and had given place to a warlike
idolatrous race of Theban kings, far more purely African, the prototypes
of the great monarchy of the 18th and 19th dynasties, and having no
affinity with anything we know of as existing in Asia in those times.Their empire lasted apparently for more than 300 years in Upper Egypt;
but for the latter portion of that period they do not seem to have
reigned over the whole country, having been superseded in Lower Egypt by
the invasion of the hated Hyksos, or Shepherd kings, about the year 2300
B.C., and by whom they also were finally totally overthrown.When we turn from the contemplation of the pyramids, and the monuments
contemporary with them, to examine those of the 12th dynasty, we become
at once aware of the change which has taken place.Instead of the
pyramids, all of which are situated on the western side of the Nile, we
have obelisks, which, without a single exception, are found on its
eastern side towards the rising sun, apparently in contradistinction to
the valley of the dead, which was towards the side on which he set.The
earliest and one of the finest of these obelisks is that still standing
at Heliopolis, inscribed with the name of Osirtasen, one of the first
and greatest kings of this dynasty.in height,
without the pyramidion which crowns it, and is a splendid block of
granite, weighing 217 tons.It must have required immense skill to
quarry it, to transport it from Syene, and finally, after finishing it,
to erect it where it now stands and has stood for 4500 years.We find the sculptures of the same king at Wady Halfah, near the second
cataract, in Nubia; and at Sarabout el Kadem, in the Sinaitic Peninsula.He also commenced the great temple of Karnac at Thebes, which in the
hands of his successors became the most splendid in Egypt, and perhaps
it is not too much to say the greatest architectural monument in the
whole world.As might be expected, from our knowledge of the fact that the Hyksos
invasion took place so soon after his reign, none of his structural
buildings now remain entire in which we might read the story of his
conquests, and learn to which gods of the Pantheon he especially devoted
himself.We must therefore fall back on Manetho for an account of his
“conquering all Asia in the space of nine years, and Europe as far as
Thrace.”[46] While there is nothing to contradict this statement, there
is much that renders it extremely probable.It is to this dynasty also that we owe the erection of the Labyrinth,
one of the most remarkable, as well as one of the most mysterious
monuments of Egypt.All Manetho tells us of this is, that Lampares, or
Mœris, “built it as a sepulchre for himself;” and the information we
derive from the Greeks on this subject is so contradictory and so full
of the wonderful, that it is extremely difficult to make out either the
plan or the purpose of the building.As long ago as 1843, the whole site
was excavated and thoroughly explored by the officers of the Prussian
expedition under Lepsius; but, like most of the information obtained by
that ill-conditioned party, such data as have been given are of the most
unsatisfactory and fragmentary form.The position which Lepsius claimed
for the Labyrinth has been found by Mr.Petrie[47] to be incorrect; the
remains supposed to be those of the walls and chambers are of much later
date, being only the houses and tombs of the population which destroyed
the great structure.The village thus created was established on the
outer portion of the site when the destruction of the buildings was
first commenced.Petrie calculates that the Labyrinth was
symmetrical with the pyramid, and had the same axis: that it occupied a
site of about 1000 feet wide by 800 ft.deep; thus covering an area
sufficiently large to accommodate all the Theban temples on the east
bank, and in addition one of the largest on the west bank.The essential
difference between the Labyrinth and all other temples was that it
consisted of a series of eighteen large peristylar courts with
sanctuaries and other chambers.Of these, according to Herodotus, there
were six, side by side, facing north; six others, opposite, facing
south, and a wall surrounding the whole.Herodotus, however, was allowed
to see portions only of the Labyrinth, probably those nearest to the
entrance.Beyond this, on the north side, Mr.Petrie suggests the
existence of a third series of peristylar courts (described by Strabo),
with sanctuaries and other chambers, and south of these, halls of
columns, and smaller halls, through which Strabo entered.In the hall of
twenty-seven columns, mentioned by Strabo, Mr.Petrie places the columns
in one row to form a vestibule to the entrances to the courts similar to
the temple of Abydos.The whole disposition of the plan, the style of
the courts and their peristyles must be conjectural, as no remains of
blocks of stone or columns in sufficient preservation have been found on
which to base a restoration.On some architrave blocks were found
inscriptions of Amenemhat III.The last remains were
taken away within our own time by the engineers of the new railway, and
apparently with the consent of the officials of the Boulak Museum, who
reported that they had been quarried from the native rock.The Hawara Pyramid, on the north of the Labyrinth, and erected by the
same King Amenemhat III., has been examined by Mr.[48] As the rock on which it was built was little more than
hardened sand, a pit was excavated, into which a monolithic chamber of
granite, brought from Upper Egypt, and weighing 100 tons, was lowered.The sarcophagus and two other coffins having been placed in it, the
chamber was covered over with three granite beams, 4 feet thick, one of
which was raised in a hollow chamber, and supported there till after the
King’s death and the deposit of his body in the sarcophagus.Round the
granite monolith were built walls which carried two courses of stone
blocks, the lower horizontal, the upper courses sloping one against the
other, as in the Great Pyramid.The rest of the pyramid was constructed
in brick, and to prevent the brickwork settling down and splitting on
the pointed roof-stones, an arch of five courses of brick, measuring 3
feet deep, was thrown across, resting on bricks laid in mud between the
arch and the stonework.The brickwork above the arch was laid in sand,
and the whole pyramid covered with a casing of limestone.Petrie calculates to have been about 334 ft.A second pyramid belonging to this dynasty, and erected by Osirtasen
II., has also been examined and described by Mr.[49] This
pyramid (Illahun) is of peculiar construction, being partly composed of
the natural rock dressed into form to a height of 40 feet, above which
rose the built portion, which was different from that of any other
pyramid, being built with a framing of cross walls.The walls ran right
through the diagonals up to the top of the building, and had offset
walls at right angles to the sides, the walls being of stone in the
lower part, and brick above; the filling-in between the walls was of mud
and brick, and the whole pyramid, brick, stone, and rock, was covered
with a casing of limestone.Petrie in the Fayum[50] was
the finding of the plan, more or less complete, of the town or village
of Kahun, which was built for the workmen and overseers of the Illahun
pyramid, and deserted shortly after its completion.The plan would seem
to have been laid out from one design, and consisted: of an acropolis or
raised space, where the house of the chief controller of the works was
placed, and which might have been occupied by the King when he came to
inspect the works: a series of large houses (Woodcut No.14), arranged
very much in the same way as those of Pompeii, and containing a great
number of halls, courts, and rooms; and many streets of workmen’s
dwellings of two or three rooms each.The walls were all built in crude
brick, the rooms being covered over with roofs formed of beams of wood,
on which poles were placed, and to these bundles of straw and reeds
lashed down, the whole being covered inside and outside with mud.In
those rooms, which exceeded 8 or 9 ft.in width, columns of stone or
wood were employed to assist in carrying the roof; such columns being
octagonal or with sixteen sides, fluted or ribbed like the reed or lotus
column at Beni-Hasan.The lower portion of a fluted column in wood was
found, existing still in situ on its base, which shows that description
of column to have had a wooden origin.The most interesting series of monuments of this dynasty which have come
down to our time are the tombs of Beni-Hasan, in Middle Egypt.They are
situated on the eastern side of the Nile, as are also those of
Tel-el-Amarna, Sheykh-Said, Kôm-el-ahman, and others.The character of
the sculptures which adorn their walls approaches that found in the
tombs surrounding the pyramids, but the architecture differs widely.They are all cheerful-looking halls, open to the light of day, many of
them with pillared porches, and all possessing pretensions to
architectural ornament, either internal or external.One of the most interesting of the tombs has in front of it a
portico-in-antis of two columns, in architecture so like the order
afterwards employed by the Greeks, as to have been frequently described
as the Proto-Doric order.[51] The same class of column is also used
internally, supporting a plain architrave beam, from which spring
curvilinear roofs of segmented form, which there is no doubt are
imitations of constructive arch forms.Proto-Doric Pillar at Beni-Hasan.]Reed Pillar from Beni-Hasan.]Lotus pier, Zawyet-el-Mayyitûr.There is another form of pillar used at Beni-Hasan at that early age[52]
which is still further removed from stone than even the Proto-Doric.It
imitates a bundle of four reeds or lotus-stalks bound together near the
top, and bulging above the ligature so as to form a capital.Such a pier
must evidently have been originally employed in wooden architecture
only, and the roof which it supports is in this instance of light wooden
construction, having the slight <DW72> requisite in the dry climate of
Egypt.In after ages this form of pillar became a great favourite with
the Egyptian architects, and was employed in all their great monuments,
but with a far more substantial lithic form than we find here, and in
conjunction with the hollow—or, as we should call it, Corinthian—formed
capital, of which no example is found earlier than the 18th dynasty.These are meagre records, it must be confessed, of so great a kingdom;
but when we come to consider the remoteness of the period, and that the
dynasty was overthrown by the Shepherds, whose rule was of considerable
duration, it is perhaps in vain to expect that much can remain to be
disinterred which would enable us to realise more fully the
architectural art of this age.Till very recently our knowledge of the Shepherd kings was almost
entirely derived from what was said of them by Manetho, in the extracts
from his writings so fortunately preserved by Josephus, in his answer to
Apion.Recent explorations have however raised a hope that even their
monuments may be so far recovered as to enable us to realise to some
extent at least who they were and what their aspirations.Manetho tells us they came from the East, but fearing the then rising
power of the Assyrians, they fortified Avaris as a bulwark against them,
and used it during their sojourn in Egypt to keep up their
communications with their original seat.Recent explorations have
enabled M. Mariette to identify San, Zoan, or Tanis, a well-known site
on the Bubastite branch of the Nile, with this Avaris.And already he
has disinterred a sphinx and two seated statues which certainly belong
to the reign of the Shepherd king Apophis.[53]

The character of these differs widely from anything hitherto found in
Egypt.They present a physiognomy strongly marked with an Asiatic
type—an arched nose, rude bushy hair, and great muscular development;
altogether something wholly different from everything else found in
Egypt either before or afterwards.This is not much, but it is an earnest that more remains to be
discovered, and adds another to the proofs that are daily accumulating,
how implicitly Manetho may be relied upon when we only read him
correctly, and how satisfactory it is to find that every discovery that
is made confirms the conclusions we had hesitatingly been adopting.It appears from such fragmentary evidence as has hitherto been gleaned
from the monuments, that the Shepherds’ invasion was neither sudden nor
at once completely successful, if indeed it ever was so, for it is
certain that Theban and Xoite dynasties co-existed with the Shepherds
during the whole period of their stay, either from policy, like the
protected princes under our sway in India, or because their conquest was
not so complete as to enable them to suppress the national dynasties
altogether.Like the Tartars in China they seem to have governed the country by
means of the original inhabitants, but for their own purposes;
tolerating their religion and institutions, but ruling by the superior
energy of their race the peace-loving semi-Semitic inhabitants of the
Delta, till they were in their turn overthrown and expelled by the more
warlike but more purely African races of the southern division of the
Egyptian valley.PRINCIPAL KINGS OF THE GREAT THEBAN PERIOD.1830

  Amenhotep I.         reigned 25 years.Thothmes I.          reigned 13 years.Hatshepsu (Queen)    reigned 21 years.Interregnum of Sun-worshipping Kings.Horemheb (Horus)     reigned 36 years.Rameses I.           reigned 12 years.Meneptah I.          reigned 32 years.Exode                B.C.1312

          XXTH DYNASTY.Rhampsinitus-Rameses reigned 55 years.Ramessidæ            reigned 66 years.Amenophis            reigned 20 years.The five centuries[54] which elapsed between the expulsion of the
Shepherds and Exode of the Jews comprise the culminating period of the
greatness and greatest artistic development of the Egyptians.It is
practically within this period that all the great buildings of the
“Hundred pyloned city of Thebes” were erected.Memphis was adorned
within its limits with buildings as magnificent as those of the southern
capital, though subsequently less fortunate in escaping the hand of the
spoiler; and in every city of the Delta wherever an obelisk or
sculptured stone is found, there we find almost invariably the name of
one of the kings of the 18th or 19th dynasties.In Arabia, too, and
above the cataracts of the far-off Meroë, everywhere their works and
names are found.At Arban,[55] on the Khabour, we find the name of the
third Thothmes; and there seems little doubt but that the Naharaina or
Mesopotamia was one of the provinces conquered by them, and that all
Western Asia was more or less subject to their sway.Whoever the conquering Thebans may have been, their buildings are
sufficient to prove, as above mentioned, that they belonged to a race
differing in many essential respects from that of the Memphite kingdom
they had superseded.The pyramid has disappeared as a form of royal sepulchre, to be replaced
by a long gloomy corridor cut in the rock; its walls covered with wild
and fetish pictures of death and judgment: a sort of magic hall, crowded
with mysterious symbols the most monstrous and complicated that any
system of human superstition has yet invented.Instead of the precise orientation and careful masonry of the old
kingdom, the buildings of the new race are placed anywhere, facing in
any direction, and generally affected with a symmetriphobia that it is
difficult to understand.The pylons are seldom in the axis of the
temples; the courts seldom square; the angles frequently not right
angles, and one court succeeding another without the least reference to
symmetry.The masonry, too, is frequently of the rudest and clumsiest sort, and
would long ago have perished but for its massiveness: and there is in
all their works an appearance of haste and want of care that sometimes
goes far to mar the value of their grandest conceptions.In their manners, too, there seems an almost equal degree of
discrepancy.War was the occupation of the kings, and foreign conquest
seems to have been the passion of the people.The pylons and the walls
of the temples are covered with battle-scenes, or with the enumeration
of the conquests made, or the tribute brought by the subjected races.While not engaged in this, the monarch’s time seems to have been devoted
to practising the rites of the most complicated and least rational form
of idolatry that has yet been known to exist among any body of men in
the slightest degree civilised.If the monuments of Memphis had come down to our times as perfect as
those of Thebes, some of these differences might be found less striking.On the other hand, others might be still more apparent; but judging from
such data as we possess—and they are tolerably extensive and complete—we
are justified in assuming a most marked distinction; and it is
indispensably necessary to bear it in mind in attempting to understand
the architecture of the valley of the Nile, and equally important in any
attempt to trace the affinities of the Egyptian with any other races of
mankind.So far as we can now see, it may be possible to trace some
affinities with the pyramid builders in Assyria or in Western Asia; but
if any can be dimly predicated of the southern Egyptian race, it is in
India and the farther east; and the line of communication was not the
Isthmus of Suez, but the Straits of Babelmandeb and the Indian Ocean.Although, as already mentioned, numerous buildings of the great
Pharaonic dynasties are to be found scattered all along the banks of the
Nile, it is at Thebes only that the temples are so complete as to enable
us to study them with advantage, or to arrive at a just appreciation of
their greatness.That city was practically the capital of Egypt during
the whole of the 18th and 19th dynasties, and has been fortunate in
having had no great city built near it since it fell into decay; unlike
Memphis in this respect, which has been used as a quarry during the last
14 or 15 centuries.It has also had the advantage of a barrier of rocky
hills on its western limits, which has prevented the sand of the desert
from burying its remains, as has been the case at Abydus and elsewhere.The ruins that still remain are found scattered over an area extending
about 2¼ miles north and south, and 3½ miles east and west.The
principal group is at Karnac, on the eastern bank of the Nile,
consisting of one great temple 1200 feet long, and five or six smaller
temples grouped unsymmetrically around it.About two miles farther south
is the temple at Luxor 820 feet long, and without any dependencies.On the other side of the river is the great temple of Medeenet-Habû,
built by the first king of the 19th dynasty, 520 feet in length; the
Rameseum, 570 feet long, and the temple at Koorneh, of which only the
sanctuary and the foundations of the Propyla now exist.Of the great
temple of Thothmes and Amenophis very little remains above ground—it
having been situated within the limits of the inundation—except the two
celebrated colossi, one of which was known to the Greeks as the vocal
Memnon.When complete it probably was, next after Karnac, the most
extensive of Theban temples.There are several others, situated at the
foot of the Libyan hills, which would be considered as magnificent
elsewhere, but sink into insignificance when compared with those just
enumerated.Central Pillar, from Rameseum, Thebes.]Most of these, like our mediæval cathedrals, are the work of successive
kings, who added to the works of their ancestors without much reference
to congruity of plan; but one, the Rameseum, was built wholly by the
great Rameses in the 15th century B.C., and though the inner sanctuary
is so ruined that it can hardly be restored, still the general
arrangement, as shown in the annexed woodcut, is so easily made out that
it may be considered as a typical example of what an Egyptian temple of
this age was intended to have been.Its façade is formed by two great
pylons, or pyramidal masses of masonry, which, like the two western
towers of a Gothic cathedral, are the appropriate and most imposing part
of the structure externally.Between these is the entrance doorway,
leading, as is almost invariably the case, into a great square
courtyard, with porticoes always on two, and sometimes on three, sides.This leads to an inner court, smaller, but far more splendid than the
first.On the two sides of this court, through which the central passage
leads, are square piers with colossi in front, and on the right and left
are double ranges of circular columns, which are continued also behind
the square piers fronting the entrance.Passing through this, we come to
a hypostyle hall of great beauty, formed by two ranges of larger columns
in the centre, and three rows of smaller ones on each side.These
hypostyle halls almost always accompany the larger Egyptian temples of
the great age.They derive their name from having, over the lateral
columns, what in Gothic architecture would be called a _clerestory_,
through which the light is admitted to the central portion of the hall.Although some are more extensive than this, the arrangement of all is
nearly similar.They all possess two ranges of columns in the centre, so
tall as to equal the height of the side columns together with that of
the attic which is placed on them.They are generally of different
orders; the central pillars having a bell-shaped capital, the under side
of which was perfectly illuminated from the mode in which the light was
introduced; while in the side pillars the capital was narrower at the
top than at the bottom, apparently for the sake of allowing its
ornaments to be seen.Beyond this are always several smaller apartments, in this instance
supposed to be nine in number, but they are so ruined that it is
difficult to be quite certain what their arrangement was.These seem to
have been rather suited to the residences of the king or priests than to
the purposes of a temple, as we understand the word.Indeed,
Palace-Temple, or Temple-Palace, would be a more appropriate term for
these buildings than to call them simply Temples.They do not seem to
have been appropriated to the worship of any particular god, but rather
for the great ceremonials of royalty—of kingly sacrifice to the gods for
the people, and of worship of the king himself by the people, who seems
to have been regarded, if not as a god, at least as the representative
of the gods on earth.Though the Rameseum is so grand from its dimensions, and so beautiful
from its design, it is far surpassed in every respect by the
palace-temple at Karnac, which is perhaps the noblest effort of
architectural magnificence ever produced by the hand of man.in length, by about 360 in width,
and it covers therefore about 430,000 square ft., or nearly twice the
area of St.Peter’s at Rome, and more than four times that of any
mediæval cathedral existing.This, however, is not a fair way of
estimating its dimensions, for our churches are buildings entirely under
one roof; but at Karnac a considerable portion of the area was uncovered
by any buildings, so that no comparison is just.The great hypostyle
hall, however, is internally 330 ft.by 170, and, with its two pylons,
it covers more than 85,000 square feet—nearly as large as Cologne, one
of the largest of our northern cathedrals; and when we consider that
this is only a part of a great whole, we may fairly assert that the
entire structure is among the largest, as it undoubtedly is one of the
most beautiful, buildings in the world.The original part of this great group was, as before mentioned, the
sanctuary or temple built by Osirtasen, the great monarch of the 12th
dynasty, before the Shepherd invasion.It is the only thing that seems
to have been allowed to stand during the five centuries of Shepherd
domination, though it is by no means clear that it had not been pulled
down by the Shepherds, and reinstated by the first kings of the 18th
dynasty, an operation easily performed with the beautiful polished
granite masonry of the sanctuary.Be this as it may, Amenhotep, the
first king of the restored race, enclosed this in a temple about 120 ft.Thothmes I. built in front of it a splendid hall, surrounded by
colossi, backed by piers; and Thothmes III.erected behind it a palace
or temple, which is one of the most singular buildings in Egypt.long by 55 in width internally, the roof is supported by
two rows of massive square columns, and two of circular pillars of most
exceptional form, the capitals of which are reversed, and somewhat
resembling the form usually found in Assyria, but nowhere else in Egypt.Like almost all Egyptian halls, it was lighted from the roof in the
manner shown in the section.With all these additions, the temple was a
complete whole, 540 ft.in length by 280 in width, at the time when the
Sun-worshippers broke in upon the regular succession of the great 18th
dynasty.Section of Palace of Thothmes III., Thebes.]When the original line was resumed, Meneptah commenced the building of
the great hall, which he nearly completed.Rameses, the first king of
the 19th dynasty, built the small temple in front; and the so-called
Bubastite kings of the 22nd dynasty added the great court in front,
completing the building to the extent we now find it.We have thus, as
in some of our mediæval cathedrals, in this one temple a complete
history of the style during the whole of its most flourishing period;
and, either for interest or for beauty, it forms such a series as no
other country, and no other age, can produce.Besides those buildings
mentioned above, there are other temples to the north, to the east, and
more especially to the south, and pylons connecting these, and avenues
of sphinxes extending for miles, and enclosing-walls, and tanks, and
embankments—making up such a group as no city ever possessed before or
since.Peter’s, with its colonnades, and the Vatican, make up an
immense mass, but as insignificant in extent as in style when compared
with this glory of ancient Thebes and its surrounding temples.Plan of Hypostyle Hall at Karnac.Section of central portion of Hypostyle Hall at
Karnac.The culminating point and climax of all this group of building is the
hypostyle hall of Meneptah.The plan and section of its central portion
on the next page, both to the usual scale, will explain its general
arrangement; but no language can convey an idea of its beauty, and no
artist has yet been able to reproduce its form so as to convey to those
who have not seen it an idea of its grandeur.The mass of its central
piers, illumined by a flood of light from the clerestory, and the
smaller pillars of the wings gradually fading into obscurity, are so
arranged and lighted as to convey an idea of infinite space; at the same
time, the beauty and massiveness of the forms, and the brilliancy of
their  decorations, all combine to stamp this as the greatest of
man’s architectural works; but such a one as it would be impossible to
reproduce, except in such a climate and in that individual style in
which, and for which, it was created.Caryatide Pillar, from the Great Court at
Medeenet-Habû.]On the same side of the Nile, and probably at one time connected with it
by an avenue of sphinxes, stands the temple of Luxor, hardly inferior in
some respects to its great rival at Karnac; but either it was never
finished, or, owing to its proximity to the Nile, it has been ruined,
and the materials carried away.The length is about 830 ft., its breadth
ranging from 100 to 200 ft.Its general arrangement comprised, first, a
great court at a different angle from the rest, being turned so as to
face Karnac.In front of this stand two colossi of Rameses the Great,
its founder, and two obelisks were once also there, one of which is now
in Paris.Behind this was once a great hypostyle hall, but only the two
central ranges of columns are now standing.Still further back were
smaller halls and numerous apartments, evidently meant for the king’s
residence, rather than for a temple or place exclusively devoted to
worship.The palace at Luxor is further remarkable as a striking instance of how
regardless the Egyptians were of regularity and symmetry in their plans.Not only is there a considerable angle in the direction of the axis of
the building, but the angles of the courtyards are in scarcely any
instance right angles; the pillars are variously spaced, and pains seem
to have been gratuitously taken to make it as irregular as possible in
nearly every respect.All the portion at the southern end was erected by
Amenhotep III., the northern part completed by Rameses the Great, the
same who built the Rameseum already described as situated on the other
bank of the Nile.Besides these there stood on the western side of the Nile the Memnonium,
or great temple of Amenhotep III., now almost entirely ruined.It was
placed on the alluvial plain, within the limits of the inundation, which
has tended on the one hand to bury it, and on the other to facilitate
the removal of its materials.Nearly the only remains of it now apparent
are the two great seated colossi of its founder, one of which, when
broken, became in Greek, or rather Roman times, the vocal Memnon, whose
plaintive wail to the rising sun, over its own and its country’s
desolation, forms so prominent an incident in the Roman accounts of
Thebes.[56]

[Illustration: 25.Section through Hall of Columns, South Temple of
Karnac.Not far from this stands the great temple known as that of
Medeenet-Habû, built by the first king of the 19th dynasty.Its
dimensions are only slightly inferior to those of the Rameseum, being
520 ft.from front to rear, and its propylon 107 ft.Its two great
courts are, however, inferior in size to those of that building.The
inner one is adorned by a series of Caryatide figures (Woodcut No.24),
which are inferior both in conception and execution to those of the
previous reigns; and indeed throughout the whole building there is an
absence of style, and an exaggeration of detail, which shows only too
clearly that the great age was passing away when it was erected.The
roof of its hypostyle hall, and of the chambers beyond it, is occupied
by an Arab village, which would require to be cleared away before it
could be excavated; much as this might be desired, the details of its
courts would not lead us to expect anything either very beautiful or new
from its disinterment.Further down the river, as already mentioned,
stood another temple, that of Koorneh, built by the same Meneptah who
erected the great hall of Karnac.It is, however, only a fragment, or
what may be called the residential part of a temple.The hypostyle hall
never was erected, and only the foundations of two successive pylons can
be traced in front of it.In its present condition, therefore, it is one
of the least interesting of the temples of Thebes, though elsewhere it
would no doubt be regarded with wonder.Another building of this age, attached to the southern side of the great
temple of Karnac, deserves especial attention as being a perfectly
regular building, erected at one time, and according to the original
design, and strictly a temple, without anything about it that could
justify the supposition of its being a palace.It was erected by the first king of the 19th dynasty, and consists of
two pylons, approached through an avenue of sphinxes.Within this is an
hypæthral court, and beyond that a small hypostyle hall, lighted from
above, as shown in the section (Woodcut No.Within this is the
cell, surrounded by a passage, and with a smaller hall beyond, all
apparently dark, or very imperfectly lighted.The gateway in front of
the avenue was erected by the Ptolemys, and, like many Egyptian
buildings, is placed at a different angle to the direction of the
building itself.Besides its intrinsic beauty, this temple is
interesting as being far more like the temples erected afterwards under
the Greek and Roman domination than anything else belonging to that
early age.At Tanis, or Zoan, near the mouth of the Nile, the remains of a temple
and of 13 obelisks can still be traced.At Soleb, on the borders of
Nubia, a temple now stands of the Third Amenhotep, scarcely inferior in
beauty or magnificence to those of the capital.At Sedinga, not far below the third cataract, are the remains of temples
erected by Amenhotep III.of the 18th dynasty, which are interesting as
introducing in a completed form a class of pillar that afterwards became
a great favourite with Egyptian architects (Woodcut No.Before this
time we find these Isis heads either painted or carved on the face of
square piers, but so as not to interfere with the lines of the pillars.Gradually they became more important, so as to form a double capital, as
in this instance.In the Roman times, as at Denderah (Woodcut No.143), all the four faces of the pier were so adorned, though it must be
admitted in very questionable taste.It would be tedious to attempt to enumerate without illustrating all the
fragments that remain of temples of this age.Some are so ruined that it
is difficult to make out their plan.Others, like those of Memphis or
Tanis, so entirely destroyed, that only their site, or at most only
their leading dimensions, can be made out.Their loss is of course to be
regretted; but those enumerated above are sufficient to enable us to
judge both of the style and the magnificence of the great building
epoch.At Abydus the remains of two great temples have been found; one of
Rameses II., with great court surrounded by piers with osireide figures
on them; two halls of columns, a sanctuary, and other small chambers in
the rear.The other, completed only and decorated with sculpture by
Rameses II., the temple having been built by his father, Sethi I. This
second temple differs in the arrangement of its plan from other examples
(Woodcut No.29); it was preceded by two great courts; at the further
end of the second court was a peristyle with twelve piers, from which,
through three doors, a hall of twenty-four columns was reached; the
columns here were so arranged as to suggest seven avenues, beyond which
were seven doors leading to a second hall with thirty-six columns,
similarly disposed to those in the first hall.These avenues led to
seven sanctuaries, the roofs of which were segmental, the arched form of
vault being cut out of solid blocks of stone (Woodcut No.Beyond
the sepulchral destination, which roofs of these sanctuaries suggest,
nothing is known from inscriptions as to their precise use.Through one
of the sanctuaries other halls of columns and chambers were reached
which lie in the rear of the building, and on the south side, and
approached from the second great hall of columns, many other halls,
chambers, and staircases leading to the roof.The special interest to
the Egyptologist, however, of this temple lies in the fact that it was
on the walls of one of these that the so-called tablet of Abydus was
discovered—now in the British Museum—which first gave a connected list
of kings, the predecessors of Rameses, and sufficiently extensive to
confirm the lists of Manetho in a manner satisfactory to the ordinary
inquirer.A second list, far more complete, has recently been brought to
light in the same locality, and contains the names of 76 kings,
ancestors of Meneptah, the father of Rameses.It begins, as all lists
do, with Menes; but even this list is only a selection, omitting many
names found in Manetho, but inserting others which are not in his
lists.[57] Before the discovery of this perfect list, the longest known
were that of the chamber of the ancestors of Thothmes III., at Karnac,
containing when perfect 61 names, of which, however, nearly one-third
are obliterated; and that recently found at Saccara, containing 58 names
originally, but of which several are now illegible.It is the existence of these lists which gives such interest and such
reality to the study of Architecture in Egypt.Fortunately there is
hardly a building in that country which is not adorned with the name of
the king in whose reign it was erected.In royal buildings they are
found on every wall and every pillar.The older cartouches are simple
and easily remembered; and when we find the buildings thus dated by the
builders themselves, and their succession recorded by subsequent kings
on the walls of their temples, we feel perfectly certain of our
sequence, and nearly so of the actual dates of the buildings; they are,
moreover, such a series as no other country in the world can match
either for historic interest or Architectural magnificence.ROCK-CUT TOMBS AND TEMPLES.But in Egypt Proper and in Nubia the Egyptians were in the habit of
excavating monuments from the living rock, but with this curious
distinction, that, with scarcely an exception, all the excavations in
Egypt Proper are tombs, and no important example of a rock-cut temple
has yet been discovered.In Nubia, on the other hand, all the
excavations are temples, and no tombs of importance are to be found
anywhere.This distinction may hereafter lead to important historical
deductions, inasmuch as on the western side of India there are an
infinite number of rock-cut temples, but no tombs of any sort.Every
circumstance seems to point to the fact that, if there was any
connection between Africa and India, it was with the provinces in the
upper part of the Valley of the Nile, and not with Egypt Proper.This,
however, is a subject that can hardly be entered on here, though it may
be useful to bear in mind the analogy alluded to.Plan and Section of Rock-cut Temple at Abû Simbel.Like all rock-cut examples all over the world, these Nubian temples are
copies of structural buildings only more or less modified to suit the
exigencies of their situation, which did not admit of any very great
development inside, as light and air could only be introduced from the
one opening of the doorway.The two principal examples of this class of monument are the two at Abû
Simbel, the larger of which is the finest of its class known to exist
anywhere.Its total depth from the face of the rock is 150 ft., divided
into 2 large halls and 3 cells, with passages connecting them.Externally the façade is about 100 ft.in height, and adorned by 4 of
the most magnificent colossi in Egypt, each 70 ft.in height, and
representing the king, Rameses II., who caused the excavation to be
made.It may be because they are more perfect than any others now found
in that country, but certainly nothing can exceed their calm majesty and
beauty, or be more entirely free from the vulgarity and exaggeration
which is generally a characteristic of colossal works of this sort.The smaller temple at the same place has six standing figures of deities
countersunk in the rock, and is carved with exceeding richness.It is of
the same age with the large temple, but will not admit of comparison
with it owing to the inferiority of the design.Besides these, there is a very beautiful though small example at
Kalabsheh (known as the Bayt el Wellee, “the house of the saint”),
likewise belonging to the age of Rameses II., and remarkable for the
beauty of its sculptural bas-reliefs, as well as for the bold
Proto-Doric columns which adorn its vestibule.There are also smaller
ones at Dêrr and Balagne, at the upper end of the valley.At Wâdy Saboua
and Gerf Hussên, the cells of the temple have been excavated from the
rock, but their courts and propylons are structural buildings added in
front—a combination only found once in Egypt, at Thebes (Dêr-el-Bahree),
and very rare anywhere else, although meeting the difficulties of the
case better than any other arrangement, inasmuch as the sanctuary has
thus all the imperishability and mystery of a cave, and the temple at
the same time has the space and external appearance of a building
standing in the open air.This last arrangement is found also as a characteristic of the temples
of Gebel Barkal, in the kingdom of Meroë, showing how far the
rock-cutting practice prevailed in the Upper Valley of the Nile.The plan on which the Temple of Dêr-el-Bahree is constructed is curious,
and differs entirely from that of any other in Egypt.It is built in
stages up a <DW72> at the foot of the mountain, flights of steps leading
from one court to the other.The temple was built by Queen Hatshepsu or
Amen-noo-het, the sister of Thothmes II.and Thothmes III., and
consisted of three courts rising in terraces one above the other; at the
back of these were two ranges of porticoes, the upper one set back
behind the lower and built into the vertical face of the rock with which
the sanctuary and antechambers were cut.As all the temples above
mentioned are contemporary with the great structures in Egypt, it seems
strange that the eternity of a rock-cut example did not recommend this
form of temple to the attention of the Egyptians themselves.But with
the exception of Dêr-el-Bahree and a small grotto, called the Speos
Artemidos, near Beni-Hasan, and two small caves at Silsilis, near the
Cataract, the Egyptians seem never to have attempted it, trusting
apparently to the solidity of their masonic structures for that eternity
of duration they aspired to.In addition to the temples above described, which are all more or less
complex in plan, and all made up of various independent parts, there
exists in Egypt a class of temples called _mammeisi_, dedicated to the
mysterious accouchement of the mother of the gods.Small temples of this
form are common to all ages, and belong as well to the 18th dynasty as
to the time of the Ptolemys.One of them, built by Amenhotep III.at
Elephantine, is represented in plan and elevation in the annexed cut.It
is of a simple peristylar form, with columns in front and rear, the
latter being now built into a wall, and seven square piers on each
flank.These temples are all small, and, like the Typhonia, which
somewhat resemble them, were used as detached chapels or cells,
dependent on the larger temples.What renders them more than usually
interesting to us is the fact that they were undoubtedly the originals
of the Greek peristylar forms, that people having borrowed nearly every
peculiarity of their architecture from the banks of the Nile.We possess
tangible evidence of peristylar temples and Proto-Doric pillars erected
in Egypt centuries before the oldest known specimen in Greece.We need
therefore hardly hesitate to award the palm of invention of these things
to the Egyptians, as we should probably be forced to do for most of the
arts and sciences of the Greeks if we had only knowledge sufficient to
enable us to trace the connecting links which once joined them together,
but which are now in most instances lost, or at least difficult to find.Of the first 10 dynasties of Egyptian kings little now remains but their
tombs—the everlasting pyramids—and of the people they governed, only the
structures and rock-cut excavations which they prepared for their final
resting-places.The Theban kings and their subjects erected no pyramids, and none of
their tombs are structural—all are excavated from the living rock; and
from Beni-Hasan to the Cataract the plain of the Nile is everywhere
fringed with these singular monuments, which, if taken in the aggregate,
perhaps required a greater amount of labour to excavate and to adorn
than did even all the edifices of the plain.Certain it is that there is
far more to be learnt of the arts, of the habits, and of the history of
Egypt from these tombs than from all the other monuments.No tomb of any
Theban king has yet been discovered anterior to the 18th dynasty; but
all the tombs of that and of the subsequent dynasty have been found, or
are known to exist, in the Valley of Bibán-el-Molook, on the western
side of the plain of Thebes.It appears to have been the custom with these kings, so soon as they
ascended the throne, to begin preparing their final resting-place.The
excavation seems to have gone on uninterruptedly year by year, the
painting and adornment being finished as it progressed, till the hand of
death ended the king’s reign, and simultaneously the works of his tomb.All was then left unfinished; the cartoon of the painter and the rough
work of the mason and plasterer were suddenly broken off, as if the hour
of the king’s demise called them, too, irrevocably from their labours.The tomb thus became an index of the length of a king’s reign as well as
of his magnificence.Of those in the Valley of the Kings the most
splendid is that opened by Belzoni, and now known as that of Meneptah,
the builder of the hypostyle hall at Karnac.It descends, in a sloping
direction, for about 350 ft.into the mountain, the upper half of it
being tolerably regular in plan and direction; but after progressing as
far as the unfinished hall with two pillars, the direction changes, and
the works begin again on a lower level, probably because they came in
contact with some other tomb, or in consequence of meeting some flaw in
the rock.It now terminates in a large and splendid chamber with a coved
roof, in which stood, when opened by Belzoni, the rifled
sarcophagus;[58] but a drift-way has been excavated beyond this, as if
it had been intended to carry the tomb still further had the king
continued to reign.Plan and Section of Tomb of Meneptah at Thebes.The tomb of Rameses Maiamoun, the first king of the 19th dynasty, is
more regular, and in some respects as magnificent as this, and that of
Amenhotep III.is also an excavation of great beauty, and is adorned
with paintings of the very best age.Like all the tombs, however, they
depend for their magnificence more on the paintings that cover the walls
than on anything which can strictly be called architecture, so that they
hardly come properly within the scope of the present work: the same may
be said of private tombs.Except those of Beni-Hasan, already
illustrated by Woodcuts Nos.16 to 18, these tombs are all mere chambers
or corridors, without architectural ornament, but their walls are
covered with paintings and hieroglyphics of singular interest and
beauty.Generally speaking, it is assumed that the entrances of these
tombs were meant to be concealed and hidden from the knowledge of the
people after the king’s death.It is hardly conceivable, however, that
so much pains should have been taken, and so much money lavished, on
what was designed never again to testify to the magnificence of its
founder.It is also very unlike the sagacity of the Egyptians to attempt
what was so nearly impossible; for though the entrance of a pyramid
might be so built up as to be unrecognisable, a cutting in the rock can
never be repaired or disguised, and can only be temporarily concealed by
heaping rubbish over it.Supposing it to have been intended to conceal
the entrances, such an expedient was as clumsy and unlikely to have been
resorted to by so ingenious a people as it has proved futile, for all
the royal tombs in the valley of Bibán-el-Molook have been opened and
rifled in a past age, and their sites and numbers were matters of public
notoriety in the times of the Greeks and Romans.Many of the private
tombs have architectural façades, and certainly never were meant to be
concealed, so that it is not fair to assume that hiding their tombs’
entrances was ever a peculiarity of the Thebans, though it certainly was
of the earlier Memphite kings.Another class of monuments, almost exclusively Egyptian, are the
obelisks, which form such striking objects in front of almost all the
old temples of the country.Small models of obelisks are found in the tombs of the age of the
pyramid builders, and represented in their hieroglyphics; but the oldest
public monument of the class known to exist is that at Heliopolis,
erected by Osirtasen, the great king of the 12th dynasty.It is, like
all the others, a single block of beautiful red granite of Syene, cut
with all the precision of the age, tapering slightly towards the summit,
and of about the average proportion, being about 10 diameters in height;
exclusive of the top it is 67 ft.The two finest known to exist are, that now in the piazza of the
Lateran, originally set up by Thothmes III., 105 ft.in height, and that
still existing at Karnac, attributed to Thothmes II., 107 ft.Both are now ascribed to Queen Hatshepsu their sister, who is recorded
to have boasted that they were quarried, transported, and set up within
the short space of seven months.Those of Luxor, erected by Rameses the
Great, one of which is now in Paris, are above 77 ft.in height; and
there are two others in Rome, each above 80 ft.Rome, indeed, has 12 of these monuments within her walls—a greater
number than exist, erect at least, in the country whence they came;
though judging from the number that are found adorning single temples,
it is difficult to calculate how many must once have existed in Egypt.Their use seems to have been wholly that of monumental pillars,
recording the style and title of the king who erected them, his piety,
and the proof he gave of it in dedicating these monoliths to the deity
whom he especially wished to honour.to 1 in., for
comparison with scale of other buildings.]It has been already remarked that, with scarcely an exception, all the
pyramids are on the west side of the Nile, all the obelisks on the east;
with regard to the former class of monument, this probably arose from a
law of their existence, the western side of the Nile being in all ages
preferred for sepulture, but with regard to the latter it seems to be
accidental.Memphis doubtless possessed many monuments of this class,
and there is reason to believe that the western temples of Thebes were
also similarly adorned.They are, however, monuments easily broken; and,
from their form, so singularly useful for many building purposes, that
it is not to be wondered at if many of them have disappeared during the
centuries that have elapsed since the greater number of them were
erected.Except one small royal pavilion at Medeenet Habû, no structure now
remains in Egypt that can fairly be classed as a specimen of the
domestic architecture of the ancient Egyptians; but at the same time we
possess, in paintings and sculptures, so many illustrations of their
domestic habits, so many plans, elevations, and views, and even models
of their dwellings of every class, that we have no difficulty in forming
a correct judgment not only of the style, but of the details, of their
domestic architecture.Although their houses exhibited nothing of the solidity and monumental
character which distinguished their temples and palaces, they seem in
their own way to have been scarcely less beautiful.They were of course
on a smaller scale, and built of more perishable materials, but they
appear to have been as carefully finished, and decorated with equal
taste to that displayed in the greater works.We know also, from the
tombs that remain to us, that, although the government of Egypt was a
despotism of the strictest class, still the wealth of the land was
pretty equally diffused among all classes, and that luxury and splendour
were by no means confined either to the royal family or within the
precincts of the palace.There is thus every reason to believe that the
cities which have passed away were worthy of the temples that adorned
them, and that the streets were as splendid and as tasteful as the
public buildings themselves, and displayed, though in a more ephemeral
form, the same wealth and power which still astonish us in the great
monuments that remain.Maspero, in his work on Egyptian archæology, translated by Miss
Amelia B. Edwards[59] devotes a chapter to the description of the
existing remains of private dwellings and military architecture.The
examples of the former are of comparatively small buildings, and were
invariably built in crude or unburnt brick; in the neighbourhood of
Memphis Mr.Maspero found walls still standing, from 30 to 40 ft.The plans which are delineated on the walls of the tombs of the
18th dynasty enable us to judge of the extent and magnificence of the
more important examples.These as a rule would seem to have features
which are evidently derived from temple architecture, that is to say,
the palaces are preceded by pylons and the courts enclosed and
surrounded with porticoes.Of military architecture the oldest
fortresses are those at Abydos, El Kab, and Semneh; at Abydos the
earliest example consists of a parallelogram of crude brickwork
measuring 410 ft.The walls, which now stand from 24 to 36
ft.high, have lost somewhat of their original height: they are about 6
ft.thick at the top and were not built in uniform layers, but in huge
vertical panels easily distinguished by the nature of the brickwork.In
one division the course of the bricks is strictly horizontal, in the
next it is slightly concave, and forms a very flat reversed arch, of
which the extrados rests on the ground.The alternation of these two
methods is regularly repeated.The object of this arrangement was
possibly to resist earthquake shocks.Pavilion at Medeenet Habû.View of Pavilion at Medeenet Habû.]No building can form a greater contrast with the temple behind it than
does the little pavilion erected at Medeenet Habû by Rameses, the first
king of the 19th dynasty.As will be seen by the annexed plan (Woodcut
No.34), it is singularly broken and varied in its outline, surrounding
a small court in the shape of a cross.It is 3 storeys in height, and,
properly speaking, consists of only 3 rooms on each floor, connected
together by long winding passages.There is reason, however, to believe
that this is only a fragment of the building, and foundations exist
which render it probable that the whole was originally a square of the
width of the front, and had other chambers, probably only in wood or
brick, besides those we now find.This would hardly detract from the
playful character of the design, and when, as it originally
was, and with its battlements or ornaments complete, it must have formed
a composition as pleasing as it is unlike our usual conceptions of
Egyptian art.The other illustration represents in the Egyptians’ own quaint style a
three-storeyed dwelling, the upper storey apparently being, like those
of the Assyrians, an open gallery supported by dwarf columns.The lower
windows are closed by shutters.In the centre is a staircase leading to
the upper storey, and on the left hand an awning supported on wooden
pillars, which seems to have been an indispensable part of all the
better class of dwellings.Generally speaking, these houses are shown as
situated in gardens laid out in a quaint, formal style, with pavilions,
and fishponds, and all the other accompaniments of gardens in the East
at the present day.In all the conveniences and elegances of building they seem to have
anticipated all that has been done in those countries down to the
present day.Indeed, in all probability the ancient Egyptians surpassed
the modern in those respects as much as they did in the more important
forms of architecture.CHAPTER V

                        GREEK AND ROMAN PERIOD.Decline of art—Temples at Denderah—Kalábsheh—Philæ.The third stage of Egyptian art is as exceptional as the two which
preceded it, and as unlike anything else which has occurred in any other
lands.From the time of the 19th dynasty, with a slight revival under the
Bubastite kings of the 22nd dynasty, Egypt sank through a long period of
decay, till her misfortunes were consummated by the invasion of the
Persians under Cambyses, 525 B.C.From that time she served in a bondage
more destructive, if not so galling, as that of the Shepherd domination,
till relieved by the more enlightened policy of the Ptolemys.Under them
she enjoyed as great material prosperity as under her own Pharaohs; and
her architecture and her arts too revived, not, it is true, with the
greatness or the purity of the great national era, but still with much
richness and material splendour.This was continued under the Roman domination, and, judging from what we
find in other countries, we would naturally expect to find traces of the
influence of Greek and Roman art in the buildings of this age.So
little, however, is this the case, that before the discovery of the
reading of the hieroglyphic signs, the learned of Europe placed the
Ptolemaic and Roman temples of Denderah and Kalábsheh before those of
Thebes in order of date; and could not detect a single moulding in the
architectural details, nor a single feature in the sculpture and
painting which adorned their walls, which gave them a hint of the truth.Even Cleopatra the beautiful is represented on these walls with
distinctly Egyptian features, and in the same tight garments and
conventional forms as were used in the portrait of Nophre Ari, Queen of
Rameses, or in those of the wives of the possessors of tombs in the age
of the pyramids, 3000 years before.Egypt in fact conquered her
conquerors, and forced them to adopt her customs and her arts, and to
follow in the groove she had so long marked out for herself, and
followed with such strange pertinacity.Some of the temples of this age are, as far as dimensions and richness
of decorations are concerned, quite worthy of the great age, though
their plans and arrangements differ to a considerable extent.There is
no longer any hesitation as to whether they should be called temples or
palaces, for they all are exclusively devoted to worship,—and to the
worship of a heavenly God, not of a deified king.What these arrangements are will be well understood from the annexed
plan of that of Edfû (Woodcut No.37), which, though not the largest, is
the most complete of those remaining.in length and 155 in
width, and covers upwards of 70,000 ft.; its dimensions may be said to
be equal to those of the largest of our mediæval cathedrals (Cologne or
Amiens, for instance).Parts only—viz., the court C, and areas M M M—of
the whole structure are roofed, and therefore it can scarcely be
compared with buildings entirely under one roof.Plan of Temple at Edfû, Apollinopolis Magna.In front of the temple are two large and splendid pylons, with the
gateway in the centre, making up a façade 225 ft.Although
this example has lost its crowning cornice, its sculptures and ornaments
are still very perfect, and it may altogether be considered as a fair
specimen of its class, though inferior in dimensions to many of those of
the Pharaonic age.by 161, surrounded
by a colonnade on three sides, and on the fourth side the porch or
portico which, in Ptolemaic temples, takes the place of the great
hypostyle halls of the Pharaohs.It is lighted from the front over low
screens placed between each of the pillars, a peculiarity scarcely ever
found in temples of earlier date, though apparently common in domestic
edifices, or those formed of wood, certainly as early as the middle of
the 18th dynasty, as may be seen from the annexed woodcut (No.39),
taken from a tomb of one of the sun-worshipping kings, who reigned
between Amenhotep III.From this we pass into an inner and
smaller porch, and again through two passages to a dark and mysterious
sanctuary, surrounded by darker passages and chambers, well calculated
to mystify and strike with awe any worshipper or neophyte who might be
admitted to their gloomy precincts.View of Temple at Edfû as it was, before it was
cleared out and the dwellings on the roof removed.]The celebrated temple at Denderah is similar to this, and slightly
larger, but it has no fore-court, no propylons, and no enclosing outer
walls.Its façade is given in the woodcut (No.Its Isis-headed
columns are not equal to those of Edfû in taste or grace; but it has the
advantage of situation, and this temple is not encumbered either by sand
or huts, which still disfigure so many Egyptian temples.Its effect,
consequently, on travellers is always more striking.The Roman temple at Kalábsheh (Woodcuts Nos.42 and 43), above the
Cataract, is a fair specimen of these temples on a smaller scale.43) shows one of the modes by which a scanty light
was introduced into the inner cells, and their gradation in height.The
position, too, of its propylons is a striking instance of the
irregularity which distinguishes all the later Egyptian styles from that
of the rigid, proportion-loving pyramid builders of Memphis.Bas-relief at Tel el Amarna.]Façade of Temple at Denderah.This irregularity of plan was nowhere carried to such an extent as in
the Ptolemaic temple on the island of Philæ (Woodcut No.Here no
two buildings, scarcely any two walls, are on the same axis or parallel
to one another.No Gothic architect in his wildest moments ever played
so freely with his lines or dimensions, and none, it must be added, ever
produced anything so beautifully picturesque as this.It contains all
the play of light and shade, all the variety, of Gothic art, with the
massiveness and grandeur of the Egyptian style; and as it is still
tolerably entire, and retains much of its colour, there is no building
out of Thebes that gives so favourable an impression of Egyptian art as
this.It is true it is far less sublime than many, but hardly one can be
quoted as more beautiful.Notwithstanding its irregularity, this temple has the advantage of being
nearly all of the same age, and erected according to one plan, while the
greater buildings at Thebes are often aggregations of parts of different
ages; and though each is beautiful in itself, the result is often not
quite so harmonious as might be desired.In this respect the Ptolemaic
temples certainly have the advantage, inasmuch as they are all of one
age, and all completed according to the plan on which they were
designed; a circumstance which, to some extent at least, compensates for
their marked inferiority in size and style, and the littleness of all
the ornaments and details as compared with those of the Pharaonic
period.It must at the same time be admitted that this inferiority is
more apparent in the sculpture of the Ptolemaic age than in its
architecture.The general design of the buildings is frequently grand
and imposing, but the details are always inferior; and the sculpture and
painting, which in the great age add so much to the beauty of the whole,
are in the Ptolemaic age always frittered away, ill-arranged, unmeaning,
and injurious to the general effect instead of heightening and improving
it.Pillar, from the Porticocat Denderah.]Plan of Temple at Kalábsheh.On the east side of the island is the very beautiful structure known as
“Pharaoh’s bed” (n).It is an oblong rectangular building of late date,
surrounded by an intercolumnar screen with 18 columns.It was roofed
with stone slabs supported on wooden beams, the sockets to receive which
still exist.There is a doorway on the west wall, and another on the
east wall opening on to a stone terrace or quay.Similar structures are
believed to have existed at Thebes, close to the river, and connected by
causeways with the temples; they may therefore have served as halls from
which the processions started after disembarking from the boats on the
river.Strange as it may at first sight appear, we know less of the manners and
customs of the Egyptian people during the Greek and Roman domination,
than we do of them during the earlier dynasties.All the buildings
erected after the time of Alexander which have come down to our time are
essentially temples.Nothing that can be called a palace or pavilion has
survived, and no tombs, except some of Roman date at Alexandria, are
known to exist.We have consequently no pictures of gardens, with their
villas and fish-ponds; no farms, with their cattle; no farmyards, with
their geese and ducks; no ploughing or sowing; no representations of the
mechanical arts; no dancing or amusements; no arms or campaigns.Nothing, in short, but worship in its most material and least
intellectual form.Section of Temple at Kalábsheh.It is a curious inversion of the usually received dogmata on this
subject, but as we read the history of Egypt as written on her
monuments, we find her first wholly occupied with the arts of peace,
agricultural and industrious, avoiding war and priestcraft, and
eminently practical in all her undertakings.In the middle period we
find her half political, half religious; sunk from her early happy
position to a state of affairs such as existed in Europe in the Middle
Ages.In her third and last stage we find her fallen under the absolute
influence of the most degrading superstition.We know from her masters
that she had no political freedom and no external influence at this
time; but we hardly expected to find her sinking deeper and deeper into
superstition, at a time when the world was advancing forward with such
rapid strides in the march of civilisation, as was the case between the
ages of Alexander and that of Constantine.It probably was in
consequence of this retrograde course that her civilisation perished so
absolutely and entirely under the influence of the rising star of
Christianity; and that, long before the Arab conquest, not a trace of it
was left in any form.What had stood the vicissitudes of 3000 years, and
was complete and stable under Hadrian, had vanished when Constantine
ascended the throne.If, however, their civilisation passed so suddenly away, their buildings
remain to the present day; and taken altogether, we may perhaps safely
assert that the Egyptians were the most essentially a building people of
all those we are acquainted with, and the most generally successful in
all they attempted in this way.The Greeks, it is true, surpassed them
in refinement and beauty of detail, and in the class of sculpture with
which they ornamented their buildings, while the Gothic architects far
excelled them in constructive cleverness; but with these exceptions no
other styles can be put in competition with them.At the same time,
neither Grecian nor Gothic architects understood more perfectly all the
gradations of art, and the exact character that should be given to every
form and every detail.Whether it was the plain flat-sided pyramid, the
crowded and massive hypostyle hall, the playful pavilion, or the
luxurious dwelling—in all these the Egyptians understood perfectly both
how to make the general design express exactly what was wanted, and to
make every detail, and all the various materials, contribute to the
general effect.They understood, also, better than any other nation, how
to use sculpture in combination with architecture, and to make their
colossi and avenues of sphinxes group themselves into parts of one great
design, and at the same time to use historical paintings, fading by
insensible degrees into hieroglyphics on the one hand, and into
sculpture on the other—linking the whole together with the highest class
of phonetic utterance.With the most brilliant colouring, they thus
harmonised all these arts into one great whole, unsurpassed by anything
the world has seen during the thirty centuries of struggle and
aspiration that have elapsed since the brilliant days of the great
kingdom of the Pharaohs.SERAPEUM AND APIS MAUSOLEUM.The remains of the Serapeum and the burial-places of the sacred bulls
(who, when alive, were worshipped at Memphis), were discovered by M.
Mariette in 1860-61.Of the former, sufficient traces were found to show
that it resembled in its arrangement the ordinary Egyptian temple, viz.,
with pylons, preceded by an avenue of sphinxes, and an enclosed space
behind, with halls and chambers, in one of which was the opening to the
inclined passage leading to the subterranean galleries.The earlier
tombs of the 18th, 19th, and 20th dynasties were hewn in the rocky
platform.From the 22nd to the 25th dynasty the bulls were buried in a
subterranean gallery.The same system was adopted from the 26th dynasty
till the time of the later Ptolemies (_circa_ 50 B.C.), but the
galleries were of greater size and magnificence, having an extent of 400
yards, and the bulls were interred in immense granite sarcophagi placed
in niches, on both sides of the galleries, but never opposite to one
another.The chief historical value of the discovery rests in the
steles, or inscribed tablets, some 500 in number, placed there as
ex-votos by pious visitors, the principal examples of which are now in
the Gizeh Museum or in the Louvre.Kingdom of Meroë—Pyramids.It was long a question with the learned whether civilisation ascended or
descended the Nile—whether it was a fact, as the Greeks evidently
believed, that Meroë was the parent State whence the Egyptians had
migrated to the north, bringing with them the religion and the arts
which afterwards flourished at Thebes and Memphis—or whether these had
been elaborated in the fertile plains of Egypt, and only in later times
had extended to the Upper Nile.Recent discoveries have rendered it nearly certain that the latter is
the correct statement of the facts—within historic times at least—that
the fertile and easily cultivated Delta was first occupied and
civilised; then Thebes, and afterwards Meroë.At the same time it is by
no means improbable that the Ethiopians were of the same stock as the
Thebans, though differing essentially from the Memphites, and that the
former may have regarded these remote kindred with respect, perhaps even
with a degree of half-superstitious reverence due to their remote
situation in the centre of a thinly-peopled continent, and have in
consequence invented those fables which the Greeks interpreted too
literally.If any such earlier civilisation existed in these lands, its records and
its monuments have perished.No building is now found in Meroë whose
date extends beyond the time of the great king Tirhakah, of the 25th
Egyptian dynasty, B.C.724 to 680, unless it be those bearing the name
of one king, Amoum Gori, who was connected with the intruding race of
sun-worshippers, which broke in upon the continuous succession of the
kings of the 18th dynasty.Their monuments were all purposely destroyed
by their successors; and almost the only records we have of them are the
grottoes of Tel el Amarna, covered with their sculptures, which bear, it
must be confessed, considerable resemblance in style to those found in
Ethiopia.Even this indication is too slight to be of much value; and we
must wait for some further confirmation before founding any reasoning
upon it.The principal monuments of Tirhakah are two temples at Gibel Barkal, a
singular isolated mount near the great southern bend of the river.One
is a large first-class temple, of purely Egyptian form and design, about
500 ft.in length by 120 or 140 in width, consisting of two great
courts, with their propylons, and with internal halls and sanctuaries
arranged much like those of the Rameseum at Thebes (Woodcut No.19), and
so nearly also on the same scale as to make it probable that the one is
a copy of the other.The other temple placed near this, but as usual unsymmetrically,
consists of an outer hall, internally about 50 ft.by 60, the roof of
which is supported by four ranges of columns, all with capitals
representing figures of Typhon or busts of Isis.This leads to an inner
cell or sanctuary, cut in the rock.[60]

[Illustration:

  FIG.2.—Section and Elevation of that marked A. Scale 50 ft.There are smaller remains strewed about, indicating the existence of a
city on the spot, but nothing of architectural importance.The most remarkable monuments of the Ethiopian kingdom are the pyramids,
of which three great groups have been discovered and described.The
principal group is at a place called Dankelah, the assumed site of the
ancient Meroë, in latitude 17° north.Another is at Gibel Barkal; the
third at Nourri, a few miles lower down than the last named, but
probably only another necropolis of the same city.Compared with the great Memphite examples, these pyramids are most
insignificant in size—the largest at Nourri being only 110 ft.by 100;
at Gibel Barkal the largest is only 88 ft.square; at Meroë none exceed
60 ft.They differ also in form from those of Egypt, being
much steeper, as their height is generally equal to the width of the
base.They also all possess the roll-moulding on their angles, and all
have a little porch or pronaos attached to one side, generally
ornamented with sculpture, and forming either a chapel, or more probably
the place where the coffin of the deceased was placed.We know from the
Greeks that, so far from concealing the bodies of their dead, the
Ethiopians had a manner of preserving them in some transparent
substance, which rendered them permanently visible after death.[61]

To those familiar with the rigid orientation of those of Lower Egypt,
perhaps the most striking peculiarity of the pyramids is the more than
Theban irregularity with which they were arranged, no two being ever
placed, except by accident, at the same angle to the meridian, but the
whole being grouped with the most picturesque diversity, as chance
appears to have dictated.Among their constructive peculiarities it may be mentioned that they
seem all to have been first built in successive terraces, each less in
dimensions than that below it, something like the great pyramid at
Sakkara (Woodcut No.9), these being afterwards smoothed over by the
external straight-lined coating.Like the temples of Gibel Barkal, all these buildings appear to belong
to the Tirhakah epoch of the Ethiopian kingdom.It is extremely
improbable that any of them are as old as the time of Solomon, or that
any are later than the age of Cambyses, every indication seeming to
point to a date between these two great epochs, and to the connection of
African history with that of Asia.The ruins at Wady-el-Ooatib, a little further up the Nile than Meroë,
should perhaps be also mentioned here, if only from the importance given
to them by Heeren, who thought he had discovered in them the ruins of
the temple of Jupiter Ammon.They are, however, all in the debased style
of the worst age of Ptolemaic or Roman art in that country.They are
wholly devoid of hieroglyphics, or any indication of sanctity or
importance, and there can be little doubt that they are the remains of a
caravansera on the great commercial route between Egypt and Axum, along
which the greater part of the trade of the East arrived at Alexandria in
the days of its magnificence.Although widely differing in date from the monuments just
described—except the last—this may be the place to mention a group of
the most exceptional monuments of the world—the obelisks of Axum.It is
said they were originally 55 in number, four of them equal to that shown
in the annexed woodcut, which represents the only one now standing; but
there are fragments of several of these lying about, and some of the
smaller ones still standing, all of the same class and very similar in
design to the large one.Its height, according to Lord Valentia, is 60
ft., its width at base nearly 10, and it is of one stone.The idea is
evidently Egyptian, but the details are Indian.It is, in fact, an
Indian nine-storeyed pagoda, translated in Egyptian in the first century
of the Christian era!(From Lord Valentia’s ‘Travels.’)]

The temple most like it in India is probably that at Budh Gya.That, in
its present form, is undoubtedly more modern, but probably retains many
of its original features.It also resembles the tower at Chittore,[62]
but towers are from their form such frail structures, that certainly
nine-tenths of those that once existed have perished; and it is only
because they are so frequent still in China and other Buddhist countries
that we are sure that the accounts are true which represent them as once
as frequent as in the country of their birth.Be this as it may, this
exceptional monolith exactly represents that curious marriage of Indian
with Egyptian art which we would expect to find in the spot where the
two people came in contact, and enlisted architecture to symbolise their
commercial union.CHAPTER I.

                         ASSYRIAN ARCHITECTURE.It is by no means impossible that the rich alluvial plain of Shinar may
have been inhabited by man as early as the Valley of the Nile; but if
this were so, it is certain that the early dwellers in the land have
left no trace of their sojourn which has as yet rewarded the research of
modern investigators.So far indeed our knowledge at present extends, we
have proof of the existence of the primitive races of mankind in the
valleys of France and England at a far earlier period than we trace
their remains on the banks of either the Euphrates or the Nile.It is
true these European vestiges of prehistoric man are not architectural,
and have consequently no place here, except in so far as they free us
from the trammels of a chronology now admitted to be too limited in
duration, but which has hitherto prevented us from grasping, as we might
have done, the significance of architectural history in its earliest
dawn.Unfortunately for our investigation of Chaldean antiquity, the works of
Berosus, the only native historian we know of, have come down to us in
even a more fragmentary state than the lists of Manetho, and the
monuments have not yet enabled us to supply those deficiencies so
completely, though there is every prospect of their eventually doing so
to a considerable extent.In the meanwhile the most successful attempt
to restore the text which has been made, is that of Herr Gutschmid,[63]
and it is probable that the dates he assigns are very near the truth.Rejecting the 1st dynasty of 86 Chaldeans and their 34,080 years as
mythical, or as merely expressing the belief of the historian that the
country was inhabited by a Chaldean race for a long time before the
Median invasion, he places that event 2458 B.C.His table of dynasties
then runs thus.—

                                      Years.8 Medes               224 commencing 2458
             III.11 Chaldeans           258            2234
              IV.49 Chaldeans           458            1976
               V.9 Arabians            245            1518
              VI.45 Assyrians           526            1273
             VII.8 Assyrians           122             747
            VIII.6 Chaldeans            87             625
                     Persian conquest                    538

As every advance that has been made, either in deciphering the
inscriptions or in exploring the ruins since this reading was proposed,
have tended to confirm its correctness, it may fairly be assumed to
represent very nearly the true chronology of the country from Nimrod to
Cyrus.Assuming this to be so, it is interesting to observe that the
conquest of Babylonia by the Medes only slightly preceded the invasion
of Egypt by the Hyksos, and that the fortification of Avaris “against
the Assyrians”[64] was synchronous with the rise of the great Chaldean
dynasty, most probably under Nimrod, B.C.If this is so, the whole
of the old civilisation of Egypt under the pyramid-building kings had
passed away before the dawn of history in Babylonia.The Theban kings of
the 12th dynasty had spread their conquests into Asia, and thus it seems
brought back the reaction of the Scythic invasion on their own hitherto
inviolate land, and by these great interminglings of the nations Asia
was first raised to a sense of her greatness.What we learn from this table seems to be that a foreign invasion of
Medes—whoever they may have been—disturbed the hitherto peaceful tenor
of the Chaldean kingdom some twenty-five centuries before the Christian
era.They, in their turn, were driven out to make place for the Chaldean
dynasties, which we have every reason to suppose were those founded by
Nimrod about the year 2235 B.C.This kingdom seems to have lasted about seven centuries without any
noticeable interruption, and then to have been overthrown by an invasion
from the west about the year 1518 B.C.Can this mean the Egyptian
conquest under the kings of the great 18th dynasty?The depression of the Chaldeans enabled the Assyrians to raise their
heads and found the great kingdom afterwards known as that of Nineveh,
about the year 1273.For six centuries and a half they were the great
people of Asia, and during the latter half of that period built all
those palaces which have so recently been disinterred.They were struck down in their turn by the kings of Babylonia, who
established the second Chaldean kingdom about the year 625, but only to
give place to the Persians under Cyrus in the year 538, after little
more than a century of duration.As in the Valley of the Nile, the first kingdom was established near the
mouths of the Euphrates, and flourished there for centuries before it
was superseded by the kingdom of Nineveh, in the same manner as Thebes
had succeeded to the earlier seat of power in the neighbourhood of
Memphis.Owing to the fortunate employment of sculptured alabaster slabs to line
the walls of the palaces during the great period of Assyrian prosperity,
we are enabled to restore the plan of the royal palaces of that period
with perfect certainty, and in consequence of the still more fortunate
introduction of stone masonry during the Persian period—after they had
come into contact with the Greeks—we can understand the construction of
these buildings, and restore the form of many parts which, being
originally of wood, have perished.The Plains of Shinar possessed no
natural building material of a durable nature, and even wood or fuel of
any kind seems to have been so scarce that the architects were content
too frequently to resort to the use of bricks only dried in the sun.The
consequence is that the buildings of the early Chaldeans are now
generally shapeless masses, the plans of which it is often extremely
difficult to follow, and in no instance has any edifice been discovered
so complete that we can feel quite sure we really know all about it.Fortunately, however, the temples at Wurka and Mugheyr become
intelligible by comparison with the Birs Nimroud and the so-called tomb
of Cyrus, and the palaces of Nineveh and Khorsabad from the
corresponding ones at Susa and Persepolis.Consequently, if we attempt
to study the architecture of Chaldea, of Assyria, or of Persia, as
separate styles, we find them so fragmentary, owing to the imperfection
of the materials in which they were carried out, that it is difficult to
understand their forms.But taken as the successive developments of one
great style, the whole becomes easily intelligible; and had the southern
excavations been conducted with a little more care, there is perhaps no
feature that would have been capable of satisfactory explanation.Even
as it is, however, the explorations of the last fifteen years have
enabled us to take a very comprehensive view of what the architecture of
the valley of the Euphrates was during the 2000 years it remained a
great independent monarchy.It is a chapter in the history of the art
which is entirely new to us, and which may lead to the most important
results in clearing our ideas as to the origin of styles.Unfortunately,
it is only in a scientific sense that this is true.Except the buildings
at Persepolis, everything is buried or heaped together in such confusion
that the passing traveller sees nothing.It is only by study and
comparison that the mind eventually realises the greatness and the
beauty of the most gorgeous of Eastern monarchies, or that any one can
be made to feel that he actually sees the sculptures which a
Sardanapalus set up, or the tablets which a Nebuchadnezzar caused to be
engraved.Owing to the fragmentary nature of the materials, it must perhaps be
admitted that the study of the ancient architecture of Central Asia is
more difficult and less attractive than that of other countries and more
familiar forms.On the other hand, it is an immense triumph to the
philosophical student of art to have penetrated so far back towards the
root of Asiatic civilisation.It is besides as great a gain to the
student of history to have come actually into contact with the works of
kings whose names have been familiar to him as household words, but of
whose existence he had until lately no tangible proof.In addition to this it must be admitted that the Assyrian exploration
commenced in 1843 by M. Botta, at Khorsabad, and brought to a temporary
close by the breaking out of the war in 1855, have added an entirely new
chapter to our history of architecture; and, with the exception of that
of Egypt, probably the most ancient we can ever now hope to obtain.It
does not, it is true, rival that of Egypt in antiquity, as the Pyramids
still maintain a pre-eminence of 1000 years beyond anything that has yet
been discovered in the valley of the Euphrates, and we now know,
approximately at least, what we may expect to find on the banks of that
celebrated river.There is nothing certainly in India that nearly
approaches these monuments in antiquity, nor in China or the rest of
Asia; and in Europe, whatever may be maintained regarding primæval man,
we can hardly expect to find any building of a date prior to the Trojan
war.All our histories must therefore begin with Egypt and
Assyria—beyond them all is speculation, and new fields of discovery can
hardly be hoped for.The Assyrian discoveries are also most important in supplying data which
enable us to understand what follows, especially in the architectural
history of Greece.No one now probably doubts that the Dorian Greeks
borrowed the idea of their Doric order from the pillars of Beni-Hasan
(Woodcuts Nos.15 and 16) or Nubia—or rather perhaps from the rubble or
brick piers of Memphis or Naucratis,[65] from which these rock-cut
examples were themselves imitated.But the origin of the Ionic element
was always a mystery.We knew indeed that the Greeks practised it
principally in Asia Minor—hence its name; but we never knew how
essentially Asiatic it was till the architecture of Nineveh was revealed
to us, and till, by studying it through the medium of the buildings at
Persepolis, we were made to feel how completely the Ionic order was a
Grecian refinement on the wooden and somewhat Barbaric orders of the
Euphrates valley.It is equally, or perhaps almost more, important to know that in Chaldea
we are able to trace the origin of those Buddhist styles of art which
afterwards pervaded the whole of Eastern Asia, and it may be also the
germs of the architecture of Southern India.[66] These affinities,
however, have not yet been worked out, hardly even hinted at; but they
certainly will one day become most important in tracing the origin of
the religious development of the further East.In these researches neither the literature nor the language of the
country avail us much.If the affinities are ever traced, it will be
through the architecture, and that alone; but there is every prospect of
its proving sufficient for the purpose when properly explored.It will hardly be necessary even to allude to the decipherment of the
mysterious written characters of the Chaldeans.There is probably no one
now living, who has followed up the course of the inquiry with anything
like a proper degree of study, who has any doubt regarding the general
correctness of the interpretation of the arrow-headed inscriptions.Singularly enough, the great difficulty is with regard to proper names,
which as a rule were not spelt phonetically, but were made up of
symbols.This is provoking, as these names afford the readiest means of
comparing the monuments with our histories; and the uncertainty as to
their pronunciation has induced many to fancy that the foundation of the
whole system is unstable.But all this is becoming daily less and less
important as the history itself is being made out from the monuments
themselves.It may also be true that, when it is attempted to translate
literally metaphysical or astrological treatises, there may still be
differences of opinion as to the true meaning of a given passage; but
plain historical narratives can be read with nearly as much certainty as
a chapter of Herodotus or of Plutarch; and every day is adding to the
facility with which they can be deciphered, and to the stock of
materials and facts with which the readings may be checked or rectified.From the materials already collected, combined with the chronology above
sketched out, we are enabled to divide the architectural history of the
Middle Asiatic countries during the period of their ancient greatness
into three distinct and well-defined epochs.The ancient Babylonian or Chaldean period, ranging from B.C.2234
to 1520, comprising the ruins at Wurka, Mugheyr, Abu Shahrein, Niffer,
Kaleh Sherghat, &c. Temples, tombs, and private dwellings, all typical
of a Turanian or Scythic race.The Assyrian and second Chaldean kingdoms, founded about 1290 B.C.,
and extending down to the destruction of Babylon by Cyrus, 538 B.C.,
comprising all the buildings of Nimroud, Koyunjik, Khorsabad, and those
of the second Babylon.An architecture essentially palatial, without
tombs, and few temples, betokening the existence of a Semitic race.The Persian, commencing with Cyrus, 538 B.C., and ending with
Alexander, B.C.333, comprising Pasargadæ, Susa, and Persepolis.An
architecture copied from the preceding: palatial, with rock tombs and
small temples.Aryan it may be, but of so strangely mixed a character
that it is almost impossible to distinguish it from its sister styles.Either it seems to be that Cyrus and his descendants were of Turanian
blood, governing an Aryan people, or that they were Aryan, but that
there was so strong an infusion of Turanians among their subjects that
they were forced to follow their fashions.Perhaps a little of both: but
taking the evidence as it now stands, it seems as if the first
hypothesis is that nearest the truth.These rock-cut tombs, and the
splendour of their sepulchral arrangements generally, savour strongly of
Scythic blood; and their gorgeous palaces, their love of art, the
splendour of their state and ceremonial, all point to feelings far more
prevalent among the Turanians than to anything ever found among kings or
people of an Aryan race.None of these styles, however, are perfectly pure, or distinct one from
the other.The three races always inhabited the country as they do now.And as at this hour the Turkish governor issues his edicts in Turkish,
Arabic, and Persian, so did Darius write the history of his reign on the
rocks at Behistun in Persian, Assyrian, and the old Scythic or Median
tongue.The same three races occupied the country then as they do now.But each race was supreme in the order just given, and the style of each
predominated during the period of their sway, though impregnated with
the feelings and peculiarities of the other two.It is this, indeed,
which gives the architecture of the country in that age its peculiar
value to the archæologist.The three great styles of the world are here
placed in such close juxtaposition, that they can be considered as a
whole, illustrating and supplementing each other, but still sufficiently
distinct never to lose their most marked characteristics.The materials
are still, it must be confessed, somewhat scanty to make all this clear;
but every day is adding to them, and, even now, no one familiar with
architectural analysis can be mistaken in recognising the leading
features of the investigation.Nimrod                     B.C.Bowariyeh, Wurka         2093

Already the names of fifteen or sixteen kings belonging to these old
dynasties have been recovered, and the remains of some ten or twelve
temples have been identified as founded by them; but unfortunately none
of these are in a sufficiently perfect state to afford any certainty as
to their being entirely of this age, and all are in such a state of ruin
that, making use of all the information we possess, we cannot yet
properly restore a temple of the old Chaldean epoch.Notwithstanding this, it is a great gain to the history of architecture
to have obtained so much knowledge as we have of temples which were only
known to us before from the vague descriptions of the Greeks, and which
are the earliest forms of a type of temples found afterwards continually
cropping up in the East.It would be contrary to all experience to suppose that a people of
Turanian origin should be without temples of some sort, but, except the
description by the Greeks of the temple or tomb of Belus, we have
nothing to guide us.We have now a fair idea what the general outline of
their temples was, and even if we cannot trace their origin, we can at
least follow their descendants.There seems now no doubt but that many,
perhaps most, of the Buddhist forms of architecture in India and further
eastward, were derived from the banks of the Euphrates.Many of the
links are still wanting; but it is something to know that the Birs
Nimroud is the type which two thousand years afterwards was copied at
Pagahn in Burmah, and Boro Buddor in Java; and that the descent from
these can easily be traced in those countries and in China to the
present day.The principal reason why it is so difficult to form a distinct idea of
this old form of temple is, that the material most employed in their
construction was either crude, sun-dried, or very imperfectly-burnt
bricks; or when a better class of bricks was employed, as was probably
the case in Babylon, they have been quarried and used in the
construction of succeeding capitals.A good deal also is owing to the
circumstance that those who have explored them have in many cases not
been architects, or were persons not accustomed to architectural
researches, and who consequently have failed to seize the peculiarities
of the building they were exploring.Under these circumstances, it is fortunate that the Persians did for
these temples exactly what they accomplished for the palace forms of
Assyria.They repeated in stone in Persia what had been built in the
valley of the Euphrates and Tigris with wood or with crude bricks.It
thus happens that the so-called tomb of Cyrus in Pasargadæ enables us to
verify and to supply much that is wanting in the buildings at Babylon,
and to realise much that would be otherwise indistinct in their forms.The oldest temple we know of at present is the Bowariyeh at Wurka
(Erek), erected by Urukh, at least 2000 years B.C.; but now so utterly
ruined, that it is difficult to make out what it originally was like.It
seems, however, to have consisted of two storeys at least: the lowest
about 200 feet square, of sun-dried bricks; the upper is faced with
burnt bricks, apparently of a more modern date.The height of the two
storeys taken together is now about 100 feet, and it is nearly certain
that a third or chamber storey existed above the parts that are now
apparent.[68]

The Mugheyr Temple[69] is somewhat better preserved, but in this case it
is only the lower storey that can be considered old.The cylinders found
in the angles of the upper part belong to Nabonidus, the last king of
the later Babylonian kingdom; and the third storey only exists in
tradition.Still, from such information as we have, we gather that its
plan was originally a rectangle 198 feet by 133, with nine buttresses in
the longer and six in the shorter faces.The walls <DW72> inwards in the
ratio of 1 in 10.Above them was a second storey 119 feet by 75, placed
as is usual nearer one end of the lower storey, so as to admit of a
staircase being added at the other.It is 47 feet distant from the
south-eastern end, and only 28 or 30 from the other; but whether the
whole of this was occupied by a flight of steps or not is by no means
clear.Taken altogether, the plan and probable appearance of the
building when complete may have been something like that represented in
Woodcuts Nos.48 and 49, though there are too many elements of
uncertainty to make it a restoration which can altogether be depended
upon.Diagram of Elevation of Temple at Mugheyr.The typical example of this class of temples is the Birs Nimroud,[70]
near Babylon.It is true that as it now stands every brick bears the
stamp of Nebochadnassar, by whom it was repaired, perhaps nearly
rebuilt; but there is no reason for supposing that he changed the
original plan, or that the sacred form of these temples had altered in
the interval.It owes its more perfect preservation to the fact of the
upper storey having been vitrified, after erection, by some process we
do not quite understand.This now forms a mass of slag, which has to a
great extent protected the lower storeys from atmospheric influences.In so far as it has been explored, the lower storey forms a perfect
square, 272 feet each way.Above this are six storeys, each 42 feet less
in horizontal dimensions.These are not placed concentrically on those
below them, but at a distance of only 12 feet from the south-eastern
edge, and consequently 30 feet from the N.W., and 21 feet from the two
other sides.Diagram Elevation of Birs Nimroud.The height of the three upper storeys seems to have been ascertained
with sufficient correctness to be 15 feet each, or 45 feet together.Unfortunately no excavation was undertaken to ascertain the height of
the lowest and most important storey.Sir Henry Rawlinson assumes it at
26; and I have ventured to make it 45, from the analogy of the tomb of
Cyrus and the temple at Mugheyr.The height of the two intermediate
storeys, instead of being 22 feet 6 inches, as we might expect, was 26,
which seems to have resulted from some adjustment due to the chambers
which ranged along their walls on two sides.The exact form and
dimensions of these chambers were not ascertained, which is very much to
be regretted, as they seem the counterpart of those which surrounded
Solomon’s Temple and the Viharas in India, and are consequently among
the most interesting peculiarities of this building.No attempt was made to investigate the design of the upper storey,
though it does not seem that it would be difficult to do so, as
fragments of its vaulted roof are strewed about the base of the
tower-like fragment that remains, from which a restoration might be
effected by any one accustomed to such investigations.[71] What we do
know is that it was the cella or sanctuary of the temple.[72] There
probably also was a shrine on the third platform.This temple, as we know from the decipherment of the cylinders which
were found on its angles, was dedicated to the seven planets or heavenly
spheres, and we find it consequently adorned with the colours of each.The lower, which was also richly panelled, was black, the colour of
Saturn; the next, orange, the colour of Jupiter; the third, red,
emblematic of Mars; the fourth, yellow, belonging to the sun; the fifth
and sixth, green and blue respectively, as dedicated to Venus and
Mercury; and the upper probably white, that being the colour belonging
to the Moon, whose place in the Chaldean system would be uppermost.Access to each of these storeys was obtained by stairs, probably
arranged as shown in the plan; these have crumbled away or been removed,
though probably traces of them might still have been found if the
explorations had been more complete.Another temple of the same class was exhumed at Khorsabad about twenty
years ago by M. Place.It consisted, like the one at Borsippa, of seven
storeys, but, in this instance, each was placed concentrically on the
one below it: and instead of stairs on the sloping face, a ramp wound
round the tower, as we are told was the case with the temple of Belus at
Babylon.The four lower storeys are still perfect: each of them is
richly panelled and  as above mentioned, and in some parts even
the parapet of the ramp still remains _in situ_.The three upper storeys
are gone, but may be easily restored from those below, as was done by M.
Place, as shown in the annexed woodcut.According to him, it was an
observatory, and had no cella on its summit.If this was the case it was
a Semitic temple, and belongs to a quite different religion from that
whose temples we have been describing.But unfortunately there is no
direct evidence to determine whether it had such a chamber or not.My
own impressions on the subject are decidedly at variance with those of
M. Place, but until some bas-reliefs are discovered containing
representations of these temples and of their cells, we shall probably
hardly ever know exactly what the form of the crowning member really
was.From the imitations in modern times we seem to see dimly that it
was conical, and possibly curvilinear.The dimensions of this tower at
Khorsabad were, 150 feet square at the base and 135 high from the
pavement to the platform on its summit.Its base, however, was at a
considerable elevation above the plain, so that when seen from below it
must have been an imposing object.Observatory at Khorsabad, from Places ‘Ninive et
l’Assyrie.’ Scale 50 ft.The inscriptions at Borsippa and elsewhere mention other temples of the
same class, and no doubt those of Babylon were more magnificent than any
we have yet found; but they must always have been such prominent
objects, and the materials of which they were composed so easily
removed, that it is doubtful if anything more perfect will now be found.The Mujelibé, described by Rich, and afterwards explored without success
by Layard, is probably the base of the great temple of Belus described
by the Greeks; but even its dimensions can now hardly be ascertained, so
completely is it ruined.It seems, however, to be a parallelogram of
about 600 feet square,[73] and rising to a height of about 140 feet; but
no trace of the upper storeys exist, nor indeed anything which would
enable us to speak with certainty of the form of the basement itself.If
this is the height of the basement, however, analogy would lead us to
infer that the six storeys rose to a height of about 450 feet; and with
the ziggurah or sikra on their summit, the whole height may very well
have been the stadium mentioned by Strabo.[74]

As before mentioned, p.158, we have fortunately in the tomb of Cyrus at
Pasargadæ (Woodcuts Nos.84-86) a stone copy of these temples; in this
instance, however, so small that it can hardly be considered as more
than a model, but not the less instructive on that account.Like the
Birs Nimroud, the pyramid consists of six storeys: the three upper of
equal height, in this instance 23½ inches; the next two are equal to
each other, and, as in the Birs Nimroud, in the ratio of 26 to 15, or 41
inches.The basement is equal to the three upper put together, or 5 ft.9 in., making a total of 18 ft.[75] The height of the cella is
equal to the height of the basement, but this may be owing to the small
size of the whole edifice, it being necessary to provide a chamber of a
given dimension for the sepulchre.In the larger temples, it may be
surmised that the height was divided into four nearly equal parts; one
being given to the basement, one to the two next storeys, one to the
three upper storeys, and the fourth to the chamber on the summit.There is one other source from which we may hope to obtain information
regarding these temples, and that is, the bas-reliefs on the walls of
the Assyrian palaces.They drew architecture, however, so badly, that it
is necessary to be very guarded in considering such representations as
more than suggestions; but the annexed woodcut (No.54) does seem to
represent a four-storeyed temple, placed on a mound, with very tolerable
correctness, and if the upper storey had not been broken away the
drawing might have given us a valuable hint as to the form and purposes
of the cella, which was the principal object of the erection.Its
colouring, too, is gone; but the certain remains of symbolical colours
at Borsippa and Khorsabad confirm so completely the Greek accounts of
the seven- walls of Ecbatana that with the other indications of
the same sort extant that branch of the inquiry may be considered as
complete.(From a Bas-relief from
Koyunjik.)]It is to be hoped that now that the thread is caught, it will be
followed up till this form of temple is thoroughly investigated; for to
the philosophical student of architectural history few recent
discoveries are of more interest.There hardly seems a doubt but that
many temples found further eastward are the direct lineal descendants of
these Babylonian forms, though we as yet can only pick up here and there
the missing links of the chain of evidence which connects the one with
the other.We know, however, that Buddhism is essentially the religion
of a Turanian people, and it has long been suspected that there was some
connection between the Magi of Central Asia and the priests of that
religion, and that some of its forms at least were elaborated in the
valley of the Euphrates.If the architectural investigation is fully
carried out, I feel convinced we shall be able to trace back to their
source many things which hitherto have been unexplained mysteries, and
to complete the history of this form of temple and of the religion to
which it belonged, from the Bowariyeh at Wurka, built 2000 years B.C.,
to the Temple of Heaven erected in the city of Pekin within the limits
of the present century.Elevation of a portion of the external Wall of Wuswus
at Wurka (From Loftus.)]The only exception to the class of temple mounds found in Chaldea is the
ruin of Wuswus, at Wurka,[76] which seems to partake of the character of
a palace.Whether it is or not is by no means clear, as the interior is
too much ruined for its plan to be traced with certainty, and its date
cannot be fixed from any internal evidence.Some of the bricks used in
its construction bear the name of Sin Shada 1700 B.C., but it is
suspected they may have been brought from an older edifice.The same
sort of panelling was used by Sargon at Khorsabad 1000 years after the
assumed date; and panelling very like it is used even in the age of the
Pyramids (Woodcuts Nos.11 and 12), 1000 years at least before that
time.With more knowledge we may recognise minor features which may
enable us to discriminate more exactly, but at present we only know that
this class of panelling was used for the adornment of external walls
from the earliest ages down at least to the destruction of Babylon.It
was probably used with well-marked characteristics in progression of
style; but these we have yet to ascertain.Externally the Wuswus is a
parallelogram 256 ft.Like almost every building in the
Euphrates valley in those ancient times, instead of the sides facing the
cardinal points of the compass, as was the case in Egypt in the Pyramid
age, the angles point towards them.In this case the entrance is in the
north-east face.The centre apparently was occupied by a court; and
opposite the entrance were two larger and several smaller apartments,
the larger being 57 ft.The great interest of the building lies
in the mode in which the external walls were ornamented (Woodcuts Nos.These were plastered and covered by an elaborate series of
reedings and square sinkings, forming a beautiful and very appropriate
mode of adorning the wall of a building that had no external openings.Elevation of Wall at Wurka (From the Report of the
Assyrian Excavation Fund.)]This system is carried still further in a fragment of a wall in the same
city, but of uncertain date.In this instance these reedings—there are
no panels in the smaller fragment—and the plain surfaces are ornamented
by an elaborate mosaic of small cones about 3 or 3½ in.The butt
or thicker end of these is dipped in colour, and they are then built up
into patterns as shown in the woodcut No.It is probable that the
walls of the Wuswus were adorned with similar patterns in colours, but
being executed in less durable materials, have perished.Indeed, from
the accounts which we have, as well as from the remains, we are
justified in asserting that this style of architecture depended for its
effect on colour as much, at least, if not more, than on form.Could
colour be made as permanent this might frequently be wise, but too great
dependence on it has deprived us of half the knowledge we might
otherwise possess of the architectural effects of other times.Shalmaneser I. founded Nimroud                      B.C.1290

All the knowledge which we in reality possess regarding the ancient
palatial architecture of the Euphrates valley[77] is derived from the
exploration of the palaces erected by the great Assyrian dynasty of
Nineveh during the two centuries and a half of its greatest prosperity.Fortunately it is a period regarding the chronology of which there is no
doubt, since the discovery of the Assyrian Canon by Sir Henry
Rawlinson,[78] extending up to the year 900 B.C.: this, combined with
Ptolemy’s Canon, fixes the date of every king’s reign with almost
absolute certainty.It is also a period regarding which we feel more
real interest than almost any other in the history of Asia.Almost all
the kings of that dynasty carried their conquering arms into Syria, and
their names are familiar to us as household words, from the record of
their wars in the Bible.It is singularly interesting not only to find
these records so completely confirmed, but to be able to study the
actual works of these very kings, and to analyse their feelings and
aspirations from the pictures of their actions and pursuits which they
have left on the walls of their palaces.From the accounts left us by the Greeks we are led to suppose that the
palaces of Babylon were superior in beauty and magnificence to those of
Nineveh; and, judging from the extent and size of the mounds still
remaining there, it is quite possible that such may have been the case;
but they are so completely ruined, and have been so long used as
quarries, that it is impossible to restore, even in imagination, these
now formless masses.One thing seems nearly certain, which is, that no stone was used in
their construction.If, consequently, their portals were adorned with
winged bulls or lions, they must have been in stucco.If their walls
were covered with scenes of war or the chase, as those of Nineveh, they
must have been painted on plaster; so that, though their dimensions may
have been most imposing and their splendour dazzling, they must have
wanted the solidity and permanent character so essential to true
architectural effect.It is the employment of stone which alone has enabled us to understand
the arrangements of the Assyrian palaces.Had not their portals been
marked by their colossal genii, we should hardly have known where to
look for them; and if the walls of their apartments had not been
wainscoted with alabaster slabs, we should never have been able to trace
their form with anything like certainty.Practically, all we know of
Assyrian art is due to the fact of their having so suitable a material
as alabaster close at hand, and to the skill with which they knew how to
employ it.Had their walls only been plastered, the mounds of Khorsabad
and Nimroud would have remained as mysterious now as they were before
Layard and Botta revealed to us their splendours.Notwithstanding the wonderful results that were achieved in the ten or
twelve years during which the Assyrian explorations were pursued with
activity, it is by no means impossible but that much more still remains
to reward an energetic and skilful research in these mounds.Still,
seven palaces have been more or less perfectly exhumed; four at Nimroud,
two at Koyunjik, and one at Khorsabad.Among these we have the palaces
of Sennacherib and Sardanapalus, of Esarhaddon, Sargon, Shalmaneser, and
probably of Tiglath Pileser.Consequently the palaces of all the great
kings, whose names are so familiar to us, are laid bare.Beyond these,
the palace of Asshur-bani-pal worthily commences the series before the
kings of Assyria came into contact with the inhabitants of Syria, and
consequently before their Biblical record begins.It may be that other
works of the same kings may be discovered, or the buildings of some less
celebrated monarch, but if we do not know all that is to be known, we
may rest assured that we already have acquired the greater part of the
knowledge that is to be obtained from these explorations.The oldest of the buildings hitherto excavated in Assyria is the
North-West Palace at Nimroud, built by Asshur-bani-pal, about the year
884 B.C.Though not the largest, it more than makes up for this
deficiency by the beauty of its sculptures and the general elegance of
its ornaments.As will be seen by the annexed woodcut (No.58), the
excavated portion of the palace is nearly a square, about 330 ft.The principal entrance was on the north, at the head of a noble
flight of steps leading from the river to the level of the terrace on
which the palace stood.From this, two entrances, adorned with winged
bulls, led to a great hall, 152 ft.in length by 32 in width, at the
upper end of which was situated the throne, and at the lower a smaller
apartment or vestibule opened on the terrace that overlooked the river.Within the great hall was one of smaller dimensions, opening into the
central court of the palace, the entrance of which was so arranged as to
ensure privacy, proving that it partook of the nature of the private
apartment or hareem of the palace.To the eastward of this was a suite
of apartments, three deep, decreasing in width as they receded from the
light, but so arranged that the inner apartments must have been entirely
dark had the walls been carried to the ceiling.As will, however, be
presently explained in describing Khorsabad, it is more than probable
that the walls extended to only half the height of the rooms, and formed
terraces with dwarf pillars on their summits, between which light was
introduced, and they in fact formed the upper storey of the building.To
the south was a double suite, apparently the banqueting halls of the
palace; and to the westward a fourth suite, more ruined, however, than
the rest, owing to its being situated so near the edge of the terrace.As far as can be made out, the rooms on this face seem to have been
arranged three deep: the outer opening on the terrace by three portals,
the central one of which had winged bulls, but the lateral seem to have
been without these ornaments; the whole façade being about 330 ft.Plan of Palace at Khorsabad, showing the excavations
as they were left by M. Botta.All these apartments were lined with sculptured slabs, representing
mostly either the regal state of the sovereign, his prowess in war, or
amusements during peace, but many of them were wholly devoted to
religious subjects.Beyond these apartments were many others, covering
at least an equal extent of ground, but their walls having been only
plastered and painted, the sun-burnt bricks of which they were built
have crumbled again to their original mud.It is evident, however, that
they were inferior to those already described, both in form and size,
and applied to inferior purposes.The mound at Nimroud was so much extended after this palace was built,
and so covered by subsequent buildings, that it is now impossible to
ascertain either the extent or form of this, which is the only palace of
the older dynasty known.It will therefore perhaps be as well to turn at
once to Khorsabad, which, being built wholly by one king, and not
altered afterwards, will give a clearer idea of the position and
arrangements of an Assyrian palace than we can obtain from any one on
the Nimroud mound.It has besides this the advantage of being the only
one so complete and so completely excavated as to enable us to form a
correct idea of what an Assyrian palace really was and of all its
arrangements.[80]

The city of Khorsabad was situated about fifteen miles from Nineveh, in
a northerly direction, and was nearly square in plan, measuring about an
English mile each way.Nearly in the centre of the north-western wall
was a gap, in which was situated the mound on which the palace stood.It
seems to have been a peculiarity common to all Assyrian palaces to be so
situated.Their builders wisely objected to being surrounded on all
sides by houses and walls, and at the same time sought the protection of
a walled enclosure to cover the gateways and entrances to their palaces.At Koyunjik and Nimroud the outer face of the palace was covered and
protected by the river Tigris; and here the small brook Kausser flows
past the fort, and, though now an insignificant stream, it is by no
means improbable that it was dammed up so as to form a lake in front of
the palace when inhabited.This piece of water may have been further
deepened by excavating from it the earth necessary to raise the mound on
which the palace stood.That part of the mound in this instance which projected between the
walls was a square of about 650 ft.above
the level of the plain, and protected on every side by a supporting wall
cased with stone of very beautiful masonry (Woodcut No.Behind
this, and inside the city, was a somewhat lower mound, about 300 ft.in length, on which were situated the great
portals of the palace, together with the stables and offices, and,
outside the walls of the palace properly so called, the hareem.All the principal apartments of the palace properly so called were
revêted with sculptural slabs of alabaster, generally about 9 ft.in
height, like those at Nimroud; these either represent the wars or the
peaceful amusements of King Sargon, commemorate his magnificence, or
express his religious feelings.The great portals that gave access to the palace of Khorsabad from the
city were among the most magnificent of those yet discovered.The façade
in which they stood presented a frontage of 330 ft., in which were three
portals; the central one flanked by great human-headed bulls 19 ft.in
height, and on each side two other bulls 15 ft.high, with a giant
strangling a lion between them, as shown in the woodcut (No.62),
representing what still remained of them when uncovered by M. Botta, and
now forming one of the principal ornaments of the British Museum.These
portals were reached from the city by a flight of steps, now entirely
destroyed, but which there can be little difficulty in restoring from
what we find at Persepolis and elsewhere.Plan of Palace at Khorsabad, as completely excavated
by M. Place.These portals led to the great outer court of the palace, measuring 315
ft.by 280 between the buttresses with which it was adorned all round.On the right hand were six or seven smaller courts surrounded by the
stables and outhouses of the palace, which were approached by a ramp on
the outside, at the head of which was a block of buildings containing
the cellarage, and generally the stores of eatables.On the left hand of
this court were the metal stores, each room having been appropriated to
iron, copper, or other such materials, and behind them, outside the
palace, was the hareem.[81]

In the northern angle, a rather insignificant passage formed a means of
communication between this great outer court and the next, which was 360
ft.long by 200 wide, and probably open to the country, at least in
front of the great portals.On the inner side of this second court a
magnificent portal opened into what appears to have been the residential
portion of the palace, measuring nearly 300 by 500 ft.Existing Remains of Propylæa at Khorsabad.]The proper entrance to this court was by the ramp before alluded to,
which was indeed the only access to the palace for chariots and
horsemen.From the second court, through the only vaulted passage in the
palace, access was obtained to the state apartments looking over the
country.The three principal of these are shown to a larger scale in the
woodcut (No.64) is a restored section of these apartments, showing what
their arrangement was, and the mode in which it is conceived they were
roofed, according to the information gathered on the spot, and what we
find afterwards practised at Persepolis and elsewhere.[82]

[Illustration: 63.Enlarged Plan of the Three Principal Rooms at
Khorsabad.It will be observed that the area covered by the walls is of nearly the
same extent as that of the rooms themselves, so that the galleries
formed in fact an upper storey to the palace; and thus, in the heat of
the day, the thickness of the walls kept the inner apartments free from
heat and glare, while in the evenings and mornings the galleries formed
airy and light apartments, affording a view over the country, and open
on every side to the breezes that at times blow so refreshingly over the
plains.It will also be observed that by this arrangement the direct
rays of the sun could never penetrate into the halls themselves, and
that rain, or even damp, could easily be excluded by means of curtains
or screens.Restored Section of Principal Rooms at Khorsabad.Restoration of Northern Angle of Palace Court,
Khorsabad.The whole of these state-rooms were revêted with sculptured alabaster
slabs, as shown in the section; above which the walls were decorated
with conventional designs painted on stucco, remains of which were found
among the débris.The external face of this suite, as seen from the north-eastern court,
was probably something very like what is shown in the woodcut (No.66),
though there are less materials for restoring the exterior than there
are for the internal parts of the palace.The arched entrance to the
court, shown on the left, is certain: so also, I conceive, is the mode
in which the light was introduced into the apartments.The details of
the pillars are not so certain, though not admitting of much latitude of
doubt.As before mentioned, outside the palace stood the hareem, of a somewhat
irregular form, but measuring 400 ft.by 280, (on left of plan, woodcut
No.The whole of its external walls are adorned with reeded
pilasters and panels like those of the Wuswus at Wurka (Woodcut No.61),
which is not the case with any other part of the palace.It has only one
small external opening from the terrace, and another, which may be
called a concealed one, from the great outer court.Internally its
arrangements are very remarkable.First there is an outer court into
which these two entrances open, and within that two other courts, on
whose side are extended what may be called three complete suites of
apartments, very similar to each other in arrangement, though varied in
dimensions.It looks as if each was appropriated to a queen, and that
their relative magnificence accorded with the dignity of the person to
whom it was assigned.But are we justified in assuming that Sargon had
three queens, and only that number of legitimate wives?Assuming this,
however, there is still room in this hareem for any number of concubines
and their attendants.The central court of the hareem is one of the richest discoveries that
rewarded M. Place’s industry.It was adorned with six free-standing
statues—the smaller court with two—and the walls were wainscoted with
enamelled tile representing the king, his vizier, lions, eagles, vines
and fruits, and other objects in a bright yellow colour on a blue
ground.The whole is, in fact, one of the most curious and interesting
discoveries yet made in these palaces.As it can hardly admit of a doubt that this was really the hareem of the
palace, it is curious that such a building as the observatory described
above (p.162), should have been erected in its immediate proximity.Every one ascending the ramp or standing on its summit must have looked
into its courts, unless they were covered with awnings or roofs in some
manner we do not quite understand; and we can hardly assume that such a
tower was intended as the praying place of the king and the king only.The fact is undoubted, however we may explain it.From the above description it will be observed that in every case the
principal part, the great mass, of the palace was the terrace on which
it stood, which was raised by artificial means to a height of 30 ft.and
more, and, as shown in the illustration (Woodcut No.60), carefully
revêted with stone.On this stood the palace, consisting principally of
one great block of private apartments situated around an inner square
court.From this central mass two or three suites of apartments
projected as wings, so arranged as to be open to the air on three sides,
and to give great variety to the outline of the palace as seen from
below, and great play of light and shade in every aspect under which the
building could be surveyed.So far also as we can judge, the whole
arrangements were admirably adapted to the climate, and the ornaments
not only elegant in themselves, but singularly expressive and
appropriate to the situations in which they are found.Another most important discovery of M. Place is that of the great arched
gates of the city.These were apparently always constructed in pairs—one
for the use of foot-passengers, the other for wheeled carriages, as
shown by the marks of wheels worn into the pavement in the one case,
while it is perfectly smooth in the other.Those appropriated to carriages had plain jambs rising perpendicularly
12 or 15 ft.These supported a semicircular arch, 18 ft.in diameter,
adorned on its face with an archivolt of great beauty, formed of blue
enamelled bricks, with a pattern of figures and stars of a warm yellow
colour, relieved upon it.The gateways for foot-passengers were nearly of the same dimensions,
about 14 or 15 ft.broad, but they were ornamented by winged bulls with
human heads, between which stood giants strangling lions.In the example
illustrated in the annexed woodcut (No.67), the arch sprang directly
from the backs of the bulls, and was ornamented by an archivolt similar
to that over the carriage entrances, and which is perhaps as beautiful a
mode of ornamenting an arch as is to be found anywhere.Other arches have been found in these Assyrian excavations, but none of
such extent as these, and none which show more completely how well the
Assyrians in the time of Sargon (721 B.C.)understood not only the
construction of the arch, but also its use as a decorative architectural
feature.[83]

[Illustration: 68.Interior of a Yezidi House at Bukra, in the Sinjar.]There must always be many points, even in royal residences, which would
be more easily understood if we knew the domestic manners and usages
prevalent among the common people of the same era and country.This
knowledge we actually can supply in the present case, to a great extent,
from modern Eastern residences.Such a mode of illustration in the West
would be out of the question; but in the East, manners and customs,
processes of manufacture and forms of building, have existed unchanged
from the earliest times to the present day.This immutability is the
greatest charm of the East, and frequently enables us to understand what
in our own land would have utterly faded away and been obliterated.In
the Yezidi house, for instance, borrowed from Mr.Layard’s work, we see
an exact reproduction, in every essential respect, of the style of
building in the days of Sennacherib.Here we have the wooden pillars
with bracket capitals, supporting a mass of timber intended to be
covered with a thickness of earth sufficient to prevent the rain or heat
from penetrating to the dwelling.There is no reason to doubt that the
houses of the humbler classes were in former times similar to that here
represented; and this very form amplified into a palace, and the walls
and pillars ornamented and carved, would exactly correspond with the
principal features of the palace of the great Assyrian king.PALACE OF SENNACHERIB, KOYUNJIK.Having said so much of Khorsabad, it will not be necessary to say much
about the palace at Koyunjik, built by Sennacherib, the son of the
Khorsabad king.As the great metropolitan palace of Nineveh, it was of course of far
greater extent and far more magnificent than the suburban palace of his
father.The mound itself on which it stands is about 1½ mile in
circumference (7800 ft.); and, as the whole was raised artificially to
the height of not less than 30 ft., it is in itself a work of no mean
magnitude.The principal palace stood at the south-western angle of this mound, and
as far as the excavation has been carried seems to have formed a square
of about 600 ft.each way—double the lineal dimensions of that at
Nimroud.Its general arrangements were very similar to those at
Khorsabad, but on a larger scale.It enclosed within itself two or three
great internal courts, surrounded with sixty or seventy apartments, some
of great extent.The principal façade, facing the east, surpassed any of
those of Khorsabad, both in size and magnificence, being adorned by ten
winged bulls of the largest dimensions, with a giant between each of the
two principal external ones, in the manner shown in the woodcut (No.62), besides smaller sculptures—the whole extending to a length of not
less than 350 ft.The principal façade at Khorsabad, as above mentioned,
extended 330 ft., but the bulls and the portals there were to those at
Koyunjik in the proportion of 30 to 40, which nearly indeed expresses
the relative magnificence of the two palaces.Inside the great portal at
Koyunjik was a hall, 180 ft.in length by 42 in width, with a recess at
each end, through which access was obtained to two courtyards, one on
the right and one on the left; and beyond these to the other and
apparently the more private apartments of the palace, which overlooked
the country and the river Tigris, flowing to the westward of the
palace—the principal entrance, as at Khorsabad, being from the city.[84]

It is impossible, of course, to say how much further the palace
extended, though it is probable that nearly all the apartments which
were revêted with sculptures have been laid open; but what has been
excavated occupies so small a portion of the mound that it is impossible
to be unimpressed with the conviction that it forms but a very small
fraction of the imperial palace of Nineveh.Judging even from what has
as yet been uncovered, it is, of all the buildings of antiquity, alone
surpassed in magnitude by the great palace-temple at Karnac; and when we
consider the vastness of the mound on which it was raised, and the
richness of the ornaments with which it was adorned, a doubt arises
whether it was not as great, or at least as expensive, a work as the
great palace-temples of Thebes.The latter, however, were built with far
higher motives, and designed to last through ages, while the palace at
Nineveh was built only to gratify the barbaric pride of a wealthy and
sensual monarch, and perished with the ephemeral dynasty to which he
belonged.PALACE OF ESARHADDON.Another Assyrian palace, of which considerable remains still exist, is
that of Esarhaddon, commonly known as the South-west Palace at Nimroud.Like the others, this too has been destroyed by fire, and the only part
that remains sufficiently entire to be described is the entrance or
southern hall.in
width, and it consequently is the largest hall yet found in Assyria.The
architects, however, either from constructive necessities or for
purposes of state, divided it down the centre by a wall supporting dwarf
columns,[85] forming a central gallery, to which access was had by
bridge galleries at both ends, a mode of arrangement capable of great
variety and picturesqueness of effect, and of which there is little
doubt that the builders availed themselves to the fullest extent.This
led into a courtyard of considerable dimensions, surrounded by
apartments, but they are all too much destroyed by fire to be
intelligible.Another great palace, built, as appears from the inscriptions, by a son
of Esarhaddon, has been discovered nearly in the centre of the mound at
Koyunjik.Its terrace-wall has been explored for nearly 300 ft.in two
directions from the angle near which the principal entrance is placed.lower than the palace itself, which is reached
by an inclined passage nearly 200 ft.in length, adorned with sculpture
on both sides.The palace itself, as far as its exploration has been
carried, appears similar in its arrangements to those already described;
but the sculptures with which it is adorned are more minute and
delicate, and show a more perfect imitation of nature, than the earlier
examples, though inferior to them in grandeur of conception and breadth
of design.John went back to the bathroom.The architectural details also display a degree of elegance and an
amount of elaborate finish not usually found in the earlier examples, as
is well illustrated by the Woodcut No.71, representing one of the
pavement slabs of the palace.It is of the same design, and similarly
ornamented, but the finish is better, and the execution more elaborate,
than in any of the more ancient examples we are acquainted with.Besides these, there were on the mound at Nimroud a central palace built
by Tiglath Pileser, and one at the south-eastern angle of the mound,
built by a grandson of Esarhaddon; but both are too much ruined for its
being feasible to trace either their form or extent.Around the great
pyramid, at the north-west angle of the mound, were buildings more
resembling temples than any others on it—all the sculptures upon them
pointing apparently to devotional purposes, though in form they differed
but little from the palaces.At the same time there is certainly nothing
in them to indicate that the mound at the base of which they were
situated was appropriated to the dead, or to funereal purposes.Between
the north-west and south-west palaces there was also raised a terrace
higher than the rest, on which were situated some chambers, the use of
which it is not easy to determine.Pavement Slab from the Central Palace, Koyunjik.]Notwithstanding the impossibility that now exists of making out all the
details of the buildings situated on the great mounds of Nimroud and
Koyunjik, it is evident that these great groups of buildings must have
ranked among the most splendid monuments of antiquity, surrounded as
they were by stone-faced terraces, and approached on every side by noble
flights of stairs.When all the palaces with their towers and temples
were seen gay with colour, and crowded with all the state and splendour
of an Eastern monarch, they must have formed a scene of such dazzling
magnificence that one can easily comprehend how the inhabitants of the
little cities of Greece or Judea were betrayed into such extravagant
hyperbole when speaking of the size and splendour of the great cities of
Assyria.Pavilion, from the Sculptures at Khorsabad.]The worst feature of all this splendour was its ephemeral
character—though perhaps it is owing to this very fact that we now know
so much about it—for, like the reed that bends to the storm and recovers
its elasticity, while the oak is snapped by its violence, these relics
of a past age have retained to some extent their pristine beauty.Had
these buildings been constructed like those of the Egyptians, their
remains would probably have been applied to other purposes long ago; but
having been overwhelmed so early and forgotten, they have been preserved
to our day; nor is it difficult to see how this has occurred.The
pillars that supported the roof being of wood, probably of cedar, and
the beams on the under side of the roof being of the same material,
nothing was easier than to set fire to them.The fall of the roofs,
which were probably composed, as at the present day, of five or six feet
of earth, and which is requisite to keep out heat as well as wet, would
alone suffice to bury the building up to the height of the sculptures.The gradual crumbling of the thick walls consequent on their unprotected
exposure to the atmosphere would add three or four feet to this: so that
it is hardly too much to suppose that green grass might have been
growing over the buried palaces of Nineveh before two or three years had
elapsed from the time of their destruction and desertion.When once this
had taken place, the mounds afforded far too tempting positions not to
be speedily occupied by the villages of the natives; and a few centuries
of mud-hut building would complete the process of entombment so
completely as to protect the hidden remains perfectly for the centuries
during which they have lain buried.These have now been recovered to
such an extent as enables us to restore their form almost as certainly
as we can those of the temples of Greece or Rome, or of any of the great
nations of antiquity.Assyrian Temple, North Palace, Koyunjik.Bas-relief, representing façade of Assyrian Palace.It is by no means improbable that at some future period we may be able
to restore much that is now unintelligible, from the representations of
buildings on the sculptures, and to complete our account of their style
of architecture from illustrations drawn by the Assyrians themselves.One or two of these have already been published.The annexed woodcut,
for instance (No.72), of a bas-relief representing a little
fishing-pavilion on the water’s edge, exhibits in a rude manner all the
parts of an Assyrian order with its entablature, and the capital only
requires to be slightly elongated to make it similar to those found at
Persepolis.Another from the North Palace, Koyunjik, repeats the same arrangement,
with pillars which must be considered as early examples of the
Corinthian order, and, if we may trust the drawing, it likewise
represents an aqueduct with horizontally constructed arches of pointed
form.74) from the same palace seems intended to
portray a complete palace façade, with its winged bulls in the entrance
and its colossal lions on the front.Above these animals, but not
apparently meant to be represented as resting on them, are pillars in
antis, as in the two previous illustrations.[86] Unfortunately the
cornice is broken away, and the whole is more carelessly executed than
is usual in these sculptures.Exterior of a Palace, from a Bas-relief at Koyunjik.]75) is that of a palace of
two storeys, from a bas-relief at Koyunjik, showing a range of openings
under the roof in both storeys, each opening being divided into three
parts by two Ionic columns between square piers, and are probably meant
to represent such an arrangement as that shown in Woodcuts Nos.On the right the upper storey is a correct representation of the
panelled style of ornamentation above alluded to as recently discovered
at Khorsabad and elsewhere, and which we know from recent discoveries to
have been so favourite a mode of decorating walls in that age.The most remarkable fact, however, that we gather from all these
illustrations is, that the favourite arrangement was a group of pillars
“distyle in antis,” as it is technically termed, viz., two circular
pillars between two square piers.It is frequently found elsewhere in
the façade of tombs, but here it seems to have been repeated over and
over again to make up a complete design.For a temple such an
arrangement would have been inadmissible: for a palace it seems
singularly appropriate and elegant.(From Bas-relief, British Museum.)]Further comparisons will no doubt do much to complete the subject; and
when the names written over these bas-reliefs are definitively
deciphered, we may find that we really possess contemporary
representations, if not of Jerusalem, at least of Lachish, of Susa, and
other cities familiar to us both from ancient and from modern history.Horse-Tent (Nimroud).]We have no representation of the dwellings of private individuals so
complete as to enable us to understand them, but there are several of
royal camps which are interesting.Among the most curious of these are
the representations of the tents of the king and his nobles.One of
these is shown in Woodcut No.76, though how it was constructed is by no
means clear.It seems to have been open in the centre to the air, but
covered at either end by a sort of hood so arranged as to catch the
passing breeze, and afford protection from rain at the same time.The
annexed woodcut (No.77), representing the front and one side of the
royal horse-tent, gives a good idea of the luxury and elegance that was
carried into the detail even of subordinate structures.Except the Chaldean-formed temples, which have been described in the
previous chapter, there are no religious edifices sufficiently complete
to enable us to form a distinct idea of what the architectural
arrangements of these temples were.As belonging to a Semitic people we
should expect them to be few and insignificant.So little remains of the temple at Khorsabad, that it is difficult to
say what its original form may have been; the terrace, however, which
supported it is interesting, as it shows almost the only instance of a
perfect Assyrian moulding or cornice betraying a similarity to the forms
of Egyptian architecture which we do not find elsewhere.The curve,
however, is not exactly that of an Egyptian cornice, being continued
beyond the vertical tangent; but this may have arisen from the terrace
being only six feet in height, which placed the curve below the line of
sight, and so required a different treatment from one placed so high
above it as is usually the case in Egypt.Elevation of Stylobate of temple.]The bas-relief on the next page is perhaps the best sculptured
representation that exists of what we might fancy an Assyrian temple to
have been.The emblem so enshrined is probably the Asheerah, or grove,
to the worship of which the Israelites at all times showed such a
tendency to relapse, and is one of the most frequent objects of
adoration among the Assyrians.As a Semitic people we should hardly expect to find any tombs among
them, and indeed, unless the pyramid at the north-west angle of the
Nimroud mound is the tomb of Sardanapalus, mentioned by the Greeks,[87]
it is not clear that a single Assyrian sepulchre has yet been
discovered.Those that crowd and choke the ruins of Wurka and Mugheyr
and other cities of Babylonia are the remains of a Turanian people who
always respected their dead, and paid especial attention to the
preservation of their bodies.The pyramid at Nimroud seems to have been
explored with sufficient care to enable us to affirm that no stairs or
inclined plane led to its summit, and without these it certainly was not
one of those observatory temples before alluded to.Still, it is so
singular to have one monument, and one only, of its class, that it is
difficult to form a satisfactory opinion on the subject.It stands at the north-west angle of the mound, and measures 167 ft.in height, is composed of beautiful stone
masonry, ornamented by buttresses and offsets, above which the wall was
continued perpendicularly in brickwork.In the centre of the building,
and on the level of the base or terrace, a long vaulted gallery or
tunnel was discovered, but it contained no clue to the destination of
the building.Sacred Symbolic Tree of the Assyrians.(From Lord
Aberdeen’s Black Stone.)](From Layard’s ‘Nineveh.’)]

The whole now rises to a height of about 120 ft.from the plain, and is
composed of sun-dried bricks, with courses of kiln-burnt bricks between
them, at certain intervals towards the summit, which render it probable
that it originally was not a pyramid in the usual sense of the term, but
a square tower, rising in three or four storeys, each less than the
lower one, as in the traditional temple of Belus at Babylon, or like the
summit of the obelisk represented in the woodcut (No.81), which most
probably is a monolithic reproduction of such a sepulchral tower as
this, rather than an obelisk like those of Egypt.Other obelisks have since been discovered, some of which look even more
like miniature models of structural buildings than this one does.Till further information is obtained, it will hardly be possible to say
much that is satisfactory with regard to either the tombs, temples, or
minor antiquities of the Assyrian people.Their architecture was
essentially Palatial—as that of the Greeks was Templar—and to that alone
our remarks might almost be confined.Fortunately, however, sculpture
was another art to which they were specially addicted, and to their
passion for this we owe most of our knowledge of their manners and
customs.To this art also we are indebted for our ability to restore
many details of their palaces and buildings, which without its aid would
have been altogether unintelligible.Judged by the same rules of criticism which we apply to Classic or
Mediæval art, the architecture of the Assyrians must, it is feared, rank
very low.But for gorgeous Barbaric splendour of effect it seems
difficult to imagine anything that could well have been grander or more
imposing than the palaces of Nineveh must have been when entire and
filled with the state and magnificence of the monarchs of the Assyrian
empire.Cyrus founds Pasargadæ                                     B.C.560

There still remains a third chapter to write before the survey of the
architecture of the central region of Asia is complete—before indeed a
great deal which has just been assumed can become capable of proof.By a
fortunate accident the Persians used stone where the Assyrians used only
wood, and consequently many details of their architecture have come down
to our day which would otherwise have passed away had the more
perishable materials of their predecessors been made use of.Whatever else the ancient world may owe to the learning of the
Egyptians, it seems certain that they were the first to make use of
stone as a constructive building material.As before mentioned, the
Egyptians used a stone Proto-Doric pillar at least 1000 years before the
Greeks or the Etruscans, or any other ancient people we know of, dreamt
of such a thing.The Babylonians and Assyrians never seem to have used
stone constructively, except as the revêtement of a terrace wall; and it
was not till after the conquest of Egypt by Cambyses that we find any
Asiatic nations using a pillar of stone in architecture, or doing more
than building a wall, or heaping mass on mass of this material without
any constructive contrivance.The Indians first learned this art from
the Bactrian Greeks, and many civilised Asiatic nations still prefer
wood for their palaces and temples, as the Assyrians did, and only use
stone as “a heap.” It must have been difficult, however, for any
intelligent people to visit the wonderful stone temples of Thebes and
Memphis without being struck by their superior magnificence and
durability; and we consequently find the Persians on their return,
though reproducing their old forms, adopting the new material, which,
fortunately for them and for our history, was found in abundance in the
neighbourhood of their capitals.Even, however, on the most cursory inspection, it is easy to see how
little the arts of the Assyrians were changed by their successors.The
winged lions and bulls that adorn the portals at Persepolis are
practically identical with those of Nineveh.The representations of the
king on his throne with his attendants are so similar, that but for the
locality it would require considerable knowledge to discriminate between
Sennacherib and Xerxes.The long procession of tribute bearers—the
symbolical animals slain by the king; the whole ornamentation, in fact,
is so slightly altered from what existed in Assyria, that we are
startled to find how little change in these sculptures the new dynasty
had introduced; and if this is the case with them, and their position
and arrangement are nearly identical, we may feel very certain that the
architecture was also the same.It appears at first sight to have been otherwise; but on closer
examination it appears quite certain that this even is due more to the
material employed than to any alteration in form.Something may be due
to the fact that the buildings we now find on the platform at Persepolis
may have been dedicated to somewhat different purposes than were those
of Nineveh; but even this is not quite clear.If the great square courts
of the Ninevite palaces were roofed over, as Layard suggested—and as
probably was the case—they would exactly represent the square halls of
Persepolis.But as all the intermediate buildings of sun-dried brick
have been washed off the bare rock by the winter rains of Persia, we can
only speculate on what they might have been, without daring to lay too
much stress on our convictions.In their present state the remains at Pasargadæ are, perhaps, more
interesting to the antiquary than to the architect, the palaces on the
plain being so ruined that their architectural arrangements cannot be
understood or restored.Elevation of Platform at Pasargadæ.]On the side of a hill overlooking the plain is a platform of masonry
(Woodcut No.82) which originally supported either a temple or
fire-altar, but this has now entirely disappeared, and the structure is
only remarkable for the beauty of its masonry and the large dimensions
of the stones with which it is built.83), not only at their joints but often on their faces, with the same
flat sinking as is found in all the Jewish works at Jerusalem, and
sometimes in Greek buildings of the best age.Thus an ornament of great
beauty and elegance is formed out of what would otherwise be merely a
plain mass of masonry.The tomb of Cyrus has already been referred to (p.164) as a copy in
stone of one of the ziggurats or terrace-temples.But it must be borne
in mind that the most celebrated example of this form is as often called
the tomb, as the temple of Belus;[88] and among a Turanian people the
tomb and the temple may be considered as one and the same thing.The
tomb is surrounded on three sides[89] by a portico of columns standing
14 feet apart: no stone capitals have been found, but it is probable
that the columns carried wooden bracket-capitals to diminish the bearing
of the wooden architrave or beam which supported the roof.Beyond the
portico there are the traces of a second enclosure 25 feet wide, which,
from its width, was probably an open court.(From Texier’s ‘Arménie et la
Perse.’)]

On the plain are the remains of buildings, three of which were palaces,
and one the ruin of a tomb.The plan of one of them, called the palace
of Cyrus, has been measured and published by M. Texier, MM.Flandin &
Coste, and M. Dieulafoy, and although the restoration given by the
latter goes somewhat farther than the remains will account for, there
are certain features in which they all agree, and which show that it
contained at least two porches or porticoes and a great hall of columns
not dissimilar from the examples found at Persepolis.The angle piers or
responds of two porticoes still exist in situ; on one of them in the
upper stone is cut the socket in which the architrave of the portico
rested, the form of this socket having a peculiar value, as it shows
more clearly than the socket in the respond of the portico of the palace
of Darius, that the Persian architrave was composed of two or more beams
placed one over the other, and overhanging, as in the tomb of Darius.A
second pier has an inscription which enables us to ascribe its erection
to Cyrus.A column, 34 feet high, of the great hall still remains, which
shows that at all events in this case the central hall rose above the
porticoes, deriving its light therefore through clerestory windows.No
capitals have been found,[90] and it is possible therefore they were in
wood, as we have suggested may have been the case in the portico of the
tomb of Cyrus.Plan of Tomb of Cyrus, Pasargadæ.To the east of this palace, and distant about 170 yards, are the remains
of a second palace with a hall of columns, and measuring 124 by 49 ft.,
and on the west side of it is the stone jamb of a doorway similar to
those at Persepolis, and carved with the well-known bas-relief of Cyrus.The third palace has been excavated by Mr.Weld Blundell, and the
foundations of its walls traced, measuring 187 by 131 ft., with a hall
of 24 columns.At Nineveh, as we have seen, all the pillars, the roofs, and the
constructive parts of the building, which were of wood,[91] have
disappeared, and left nothing but the massive walls, which, falling and
being heaped the one on the other, have buried themselves and their
ornaments till the present day.At Persepolis, on the contrary, the
brick walls, being thinner and exposed on the bare surface of the naked
rock, have been washed away by the storms and rains of 2000 years,
leaving only the skeletons of the buildings.In the rocky country of
Persia, however, the architect fortunately used stone; and we have thus
at Persepolis, if the expression may be used, all the bones of the
building, but without the flesh; and at Nineveh, the flesh, but without
the bones that gave it form and substance.View from top of Great Stairs at Persepolis.]The general appearance of the ruins, as they at present stand, will be
seen from the woodcut (No.[92] The principal mass in the foreground
on the left is the Propylæa of Xerxes, and behind that and to the right
stand the pillars of the Chehil Minar, or Great Hall of Xerxes.Between
these are seen in the distance the remains of the smaller halls of
Darius and Xerxes.The most striking features in this view are the staircases that led from
the plain to the platform, and from the lower level to that on which the
great hall stood.Indeed, among these ruins, nothing is more remarkable
than these great flights of steps.The builders of those days were, so
far as we know, the only people who really understood the value of this
feature.The Egyptians seem wholly to have neglected it, and the Greeks
to have cared little about it; but it was not so at Nineveh, where, so
far as we can understand from the indistinct traces left, the stairs
must have been one of the most important parts of the design.But they
were so situated that they were not buried when the buildings were
ruined, and consequently have been removed.At Jerusalem, too, we read
that when the Queen of Sheba saw “the ascent by which Solomon went up to
the house of the Lord, there was no more spirit in her.” Indeed, in all
the ancient temples and palaces of this district, more attention is paid
to this feature than to almost any other; and from their favourable
situation on artificial terraces, the builders were enabled to apply
their stairs with far more effect than any others in ancient or in
modern times.The lower or great staircase at Persepolis is plain, and without any
sculpture, but is built of the most massive Cyclopean masonry, and of
great width and very easy acclivity.That in front of the great hall is
ornamented with sculpture, in three tiers, representing the people of
the land bringing presents and the subject nations tribute, to lay at
the feet of the monarch, combined with mythological representations; the
whole bearing a very considerable resemblance to the sculptures on the
walls of the Assyrian palaces, though the position is different.The
arrangement of these stairs, too, is peculiar, none of them being at
right angles to the buildings they approach, but all being double,
apparently to permit of processions passing the throne, situated in the
porches at their summit, without interruption, and without altering the
line of march.One of these flights, leading to the platform of Xerxes’ palace, is
shown in the woodcut (No.In arrangement it is like the stairs
leading to the great terrace, but very much smaller, and is profusely
adorned with sculpture.The principal apartment in all the buildings situated on the platform is
a central square hall, the floor of which is studded with pillars placed
equidistant the one from the other.The smallest have 4 pillars, the
next 16, then 36, and one has 100 pillars on its floor; but to avoid
inventing new names, we may call these respectively, distyle,
tetrastyle, hexastyle, and decastyle halls, from their having 2, 4, 6,
or 10 pillars on each face of the phalanx, and because that is the
number of the pillars in their porticoes when they have any.The building at the head of the great stairs is a distyle hall, having 4
pillars supporting its roof.On each side of the first public entrance
stands a human-headed winged bull, so nearly identical with those found
in Assyrian palaces as to leave no doubt of their having the same
origin.At the opposite entrance are two bulls without wings, but drawn
with the same bold, massive proportions which distinguish all the
sculptured animals in the palaces of Assyria and Persia.The other, or
palace entrance, is destroyed, the foundation only remaining; but this,
with the foundations of the walls, leaves no room to doubt that the
annexed woodcut (No.89) is a true representation of its
ground-plan.[93] Nor can it be doubted that this is one of those
buildings so frequently mentioned in the Bible as a “gate,” not the door
of a city or buildings, but a gate of justice, such as that where
Mordecai sat at Susa—where Abraham bought his field—where Ruth’s
marriage was judged of—and, indeed, where public business was generally
transacted.There are three other distyle halls or gates on the platform: one to the
westward of this, very much ruined; one in the centre of the whole
group, which seems to have had external porticoes; and a third on the
platform in front of the palace of Xerxes.There are two tetrastyle halls, one of which, erected by Darius (woodcut
No.90), is the most interesting of the smaller buildings on the
terrace.It is the only building that faces the south, and is approached
by a flight of steps, represented with the whole façade of the palace as
it now stands in the woodcut (No.These steps led to a tetrastyle
porch, two ranges in depth, which opened into the central hall with its
16 columns, around which were arranged smaller rooms or cells, either
for the occupation of the king, if it was a palace, or of the priests if
a temple.In the western side a staircase and doorway were added,
somewhat unsymmetrically, by Artaxerxes.These remains would hardly suffice to enable us to restore the external
appearance of the palace; but fortunately the same king who built the
palace for his use on this mound, repeated it in the rock as an “eternal
dwelling” for himself after death.The tomb known as that of Darius at
Naksh-i-Rustam (woodcut No.92), is an exact reproduction, not only of
the architectural features of the palace, but to the same scale, and in
every respect so similar, that it seems impossible to doubt but that the
one was intended as a literal copy of the other.Assuming it to be so,
we learn what kind of cornice rested on the double bull capitals.And
what is still more interesting, we obtain a representation of a prayer
platform, which we have described elsewhere as a Talar,[94] but the
meaning of which we should hardly know but for this representation.The other tetrastyle hall is similar to this, but plainer and somewhat
smaller.Façade of Palace of Darius at Persepolis.Turning from these to the hexastyle halls, the smallest but most perfect
(Woodcut No.91) is that standing on the southern edge of the upper
platform, the inscriptions on which certainly prove it to have been
built by Xerxes.Tomb of Darius at Naksh-i-Rustam, representing the
façade of his Palace surmounted by a Talar.]The platform on which it stands is approached by two flights of steps,
that on the east being the one represented in the woodcut No.84,—there
are also indications of a tetrastyle hall or gate having existed on its
summit,—while that to the west is much simpler.The hall itself had a
portico of 12 columns, and on each side a range of smaller apartments,
the two principal of which had their roof supported by 4 pillars each.The building is one of great beauty in itself, but its greatest value is
that it enables us to understand the arrangement of the great hall of
Xerxes—the Chehil Minar—the most splendid building of which any remains
exist in this part of the world.94)
it will be seen that the arrangement of the whole central part is
identical with that of the building just described.There can be no
possible doubt about this, as the bases of all the 72 columns still
exist in situ, as well as the jambs of the two principal doorways, which
are shaded darker in the plan.The side and rear walls only are restored
from the preceding illustration.The only difference is, that instead of
the two distyle halls on either side, this had hexastyle porticoes of 12
pillars each, similar to that in front; the angles between which were in
all probability filled up with rooms or buildings, as suggested in the
plan.[95]

[Illustration: 94.Restored Plan of Great Hall of Xerxes at Persepolis.Two orders of pillars were employed to support the roof of this splendid
building; one, represented in Woodcut No.91, with double bull capitals,
like those of the porch of Darius’s palace.in
height from the floor to the back of the bull’s neck, or 64 ft.to the
under side of the beam that lay between the bulls.The other order, with
the Ionic volutes (woodcut No.96), was also that employed in the
northern portico, and generally in the interior throughout this
building, and is nearly identical, as far as the base and shaft are
concerned, except in the height of the latter.The capital, however,
differs widely, and is 16 ft.in height, making an order
altogether 9 ft.less than that used externally, the difference
being made up by brackets of wood, which supported the beams of the
roof, internally at least, though externally the double bull capital
probably surmounted these Ionic-like scrolls.There is no reason to doubt that these halls also had platforms or
talars like the smaller halls, which would also serve to shelter any
opening in the roof, though in the present instance it seems very
doubtful if any such openings or skylights existed or were indeed
required.Thus arranged, the section of the buildings would be as shown in the
woodcut (No.97); and presuming this structure to have been sculptured
and painted as richly as others of its age and class, which it no doubt
was, it must have been not only one of the largest, but one of the most
splendid buildings of antiquity.In plan it was a rectangle of about 300
ft.by 350, and consequently covered 105,000 square ft.; it was thus
larger than the hypostyle hall at Karnac, or any of the largest temples
of Greece or Rome.It is larger, too, than any mediæval cathedral except
that of Milan; and although it has neither the stone roof of a
cathedral, nor the massiveness of an Egyptian building, still its size
and proportions, combined with the lightness of its architecture and the
beauty of its decorations, must have made it one of the most beautiful
buildings ever erected.Both in design and proportion it far surpassed
those of Assyria, and though possessing much of detail or ornament that
was almost identical, its arrangement and proportions were so superior
in every respect that no similar building in Nineveh can be compared
with this, the great architectural creation of the Persian Empire.There is no octastyle hall at Persepolis, and only one decastyle.In
this instance the hall itself measured about 225 ft.each way, and had
100 pillars on its floor; still, it was low in proportion, devoid of
lateral porticoes, and consequently by no means so magnificent a
building as the great hall of Xerxes.The portico in front was two
ranges in depth, and flanked by gigantic bulls; but as the whole height
was barely 25 ft., it could not have been a remarkable or pleasing
object.The sculptures on the jambs of the doorways are the most
interesting part of this building; these represent the king on his
throne, and various mythological subjects, on a more extensive scale
than those similarly situated in the other buildings of the platform.Indeed, it is probable that in the other palaces these subjects were
painted on the internal walls, as was done in those Assyrian halls which
were not revêted with slabs.With an appropriateness that cannot be too
much praised, sculpture seems always to have been used in parts of the
building exposed to atmospheric injury, and, because of the exposure, to
have been employed there in preference to painting.Besides these buildings on the platform there are the remains of several
others on the plain, and within the precincts of the town of Istakr is a
building still called the Hareem of Jemsheed, and which may in reality
have been the residence of the Achæmenian kings.It certainly belongs to
their age, and from the irregularity of its form, and its general
proportions, looks very much more like a residence, properly so called,
than any of the monumental erections on the neighbouring platform of
Persepolis.Looked at from an architectural point of view the principal defect of
the interior arrangement, especially of the smaller Persepolitan halls,
is that their floor is unnecessarily crowded with pillars.As these had
to support only a wooden roof, some might have been dispensed with, or a
more artistic arrangement have been adopted.This would no doubt have
been done but for the influence of the Assyrian style, in which frequent
pillars were indispensable to support the heavy flat roofs, and as they
were of timber a greater number were required than would have been the
case if of stone.Those of wood also looked less cumbersome and less in
the way than those made of more durable materials.It is also a defect that the capitals of the pillars retain at
Persepolis so much of the form of their wooden prototypes.In wood such
capitals as those depicted (Woodcuts No.In stone they are clumsy; and the Greeks showed their usual
discrimination when they cut away all the volutes but one pair and
adopted a stone construction for the entablature.Notwithstanding these defects, there is a grandeur of conception about
the Persepolitan halls which entitles them to our admiration.Their
greatest point of interest to the architectural student consists
probably in their being examples of a transition from a wooden to a
stone style of art, and in their enabling us to complete and understand
that art which had been elaborated in the valley of the Euphrates during
previous centuries; but which, owing to the perishable nature of the
materials employed, has almost wholly passed away, without leaving
sufficient traces to enable all its characteristics to be understood or
restored.Loftus at Susa in 1850 laid bare the foundations
of a palace almost identical both in plan and dimensions with the Chehil
Minar at Persepolis.It was, however, much more completely ruined, the
place having long been used as a quarry by the inhabitants of the
neighbouring plains, so that now only the bases of the pillars remain in
situ, with fragments of the shafts and capitals strewed everywhere
about, but no walls or doorways, or other architectural members to
enable us to supply what is wanting at Persepolis.Restored Elevation of Capital at Susa.The bases seem to be of the same form and style as those at Persepolis,
but rather more richly carved.The capitals are also more elaborate, but
more essentially wooden in their form, and betray their origin not only
in the exuberance of their carving but also in the disproportion of the
capital to the shaft.In wood so large a capital does not look
disproportioned to so slender a shaft; in stone the effect is most
disagreeable, and was to a certain extent remedied at Persepolis so soon
as the result was perceived.Whether the Persians would ever have been
able to shake off entirely the wooden original is not quite clear, but
the Greeks, being bound by no such association, cut the knot at once,
and saved them the trouble.In 1885, M. Marcel Dieulafoy turned his attention to the excavations as
left by Loftus, and conceiving the idea that the principal entrance
should be sought for on the south side of the palace, he cut his
trenches in a north-east direction and discovered the traces of the
walls enclosing the court in front of the palace.These walls were faced
with enamelled beton blocks.Portions of these enamels had disappeared,
but sufficient remained, as the walls had fallen on their faces, to
allow of their being placed in their relative positions.From these
fragments M. Dieulafoy was able to put together a frieze of lions not
dissimilar to those found in the palace of Sargon at Khorsabad, with
decorative borders above and below, the whole crowned by a battlement,
also in enamelled colours.The lower portion of the wall was covered
with unglazed bricks of two colours, red and white, arranged in diaper
patterns.Continuing the trench, M. Dieulafoy discovered the great
staircase placed at the south side of the tumulus, a staircase of even
greater dimensions than the well-known example of Persepolis.Loftus’s researches had already proved that the palace consisted of a
central hall of thirty-six columns, with three porticoes of twelve
columns, similar, therefore, to the great hall of Xerxes.M. Dieulafoy’s
discoveries have shown that the central hall was enclosed with a wall,
thus confirming the late Mr.Fergusson’s theory as to the restoration of
the palace of Xerxes (see p.On the east side leading to the royal
entrance of the great hall, M. Dieulafoy discovered the remains of the
great frieze of archers (Woodcut No.99), now in the Louvre; these were
executed in bright enamelled colours on beton bricks.The figures, which
are about 5 ft.in height, are modelled in low relief, arrayed in
processional order, each man grasping a lance in his hand and carrying,
slung on his shoulder, a bow and quiver full of arrows.The shape of
each man’s dress is the same, but the colours and patterns alternate; in
one case the dress is studded with rosettes, in the other with squares
containing the earliest heraldic device known, a representation of three
towers on a hill.These enamels, as also those of the lions and of fragments of the
crenelated staircase, are now all in the Louvre, and retain sufficient
of their pristine effect to suggest a scheme of colour and of decorative
treatment of the greatest beauty.[96] The inscriptions round the bases
of the pillars had already informed us that the hall was erected by
Darius and Xerxes, but repaired and restored by Artaxerxes Mnemon, who
added the inscriptions.This has been confirmed by another inscription
under the lions on the pylons; these M. Dieulafoy attributes to Xerxes,
as fragments of enamelled bricks of burnt clay, and not beton, and
therefore of an earlier building, have been utilised as a filling-in.In
all probability the hall of this palace is the identical hall in which
the scenes described in the Book of Esther took place.The foundations
of other parts of this palace might be no doubt laid bare by further
excavations; but the ruin of the place has been so complete, that little
of interest in an architectural point of view can be looked for.Below
these Persian ruins are probably buried the remains of long-preceding
dynasties, which deeper excavations would lay bare, and which would in
all probability afford a rich harvest to the historical explorer.Near the town of Istakr, and opposite the tombs of Naksh-i-Rustam,
stands a small tower-like building, represented in Woodcut No.The
lower part is solid; the upper contains a small square apartment, roofed
by two great flat slabs of stone.Access to this chamber is obtained by
a doorway situated at some distance from the ground.Both the traditions of the place and the knowledge we have of their
religious practices point to this as one of the fire temples of the
ancient Persians.Its roof is internally still black, probably with the
smoke of ancient fires, and though simple and insignificant as an
architectural monument, it is interesting as the only form of a temple
apart from regal state which the ancient Persians possessed.Another, almost identical in form, is found at Pasargadæ,[97] and a
third exists (according to Stolze) near Maubandajan, at the foot of the
Kuh Pir-i-mard, eleven miles to east of Fasa.Perrot suggests it may
have been the tomb of Hytaspes, father of Darius.The celebrated Kaabah
at Mecca, to which all the Moslem world now bow in prayer, is probably a
fourth, while the temple represented in Woodcut No.81, from Lord
Aberdeen’s Black Stone, may be a representation of such a structure as
these, with its curtains and paraphernalia complete.It is too evident,
however, that the Persians were not a temple-building people,[98] and
the examples that have come down to our time are too few and too
insignificant on which to found any theory.Little requires to be said of the tombs of the Persians; that of Darius
is represented in plan and elevation in Woodcut No.92, and, as before
remarked, it is a literal copy on the rock of the façade of his palace.Internally, three small cells contained the remains of the king, with
those of the persons, probably his favourite wife or wives for whom he
had destined that honour.Close by this, at Naksh-i-Rustam, are four
others, and in the rock behind Persepolis are three more tombs of the
Achæmenian kings, identical with these in all essential respects; but
still with such a difference in workmanship and detail as would enable a
careful architectural student easily to detect a sequence, and so affix
to each, approximately at least, the name of the king whose sepulchre it
is.Unfortunately, that of Darius only is inscribed; but his position in
the dynasty is so well known, that, starting from that point, it would
be easy to assign each of these tombs to the king who excavated it for
his own resting-place.Although these tombs of the Achæmenians are not remarkable for their
magnificence, they are interesting in an architectural point of view,
inasmuch as—as pointed out above—they enable us to restore their
structural buildings in a manner we would hardly be able to do without
their assistance.They are also interesting ethnographically as
indicating that these kings of Persia were far from being the pure
Aryans the language of their inscriptions would lead us to suspect they
might be.There are not, so far as is yet known, any series of rock-cut
sepulchres belonging to any dynasty of pure Aryan blood.Nor would any
king of Semitic race attempt anything of the sort.Their evidence,
therefore, as far as it goes—and it is tolerably distinct—seems to prove
that the Achæmenian kings were of Turanian race.They only, and not any
of their subjects in Persia, seem to have adopted this style of
grandeur, which, as we shall presently see, was common in Asia Minor,
and other countries subject to their sway, but who were of a different
race altogether.CHAPTER V.

                         INVENTION OF THE ARCH.Before leaving this early section of architecture, it may be as well
briefly to refer to the invention of the true arch, regarding which
considerable misconception still exists.It is generally supposed that the Egyptians were ignorant of the true
principles of the arch, and only employed two stones meeting one another
at a certain angle in the centre when they wished to cover a larger
space than could conveniently be done by a single block.This, however,
seems to be a mistake, as many of the tombs and chambers around the
pyramids and the temples at Thebes are roofed by stone and brick arches
of a semicircular form, and perfect in every respect as far as the
principles of the arch are concerned.Several of these have been drawn by Lepsius, and are engraved in his
work; but, as no text accompanies them, and the drawings are not on a
sufficient scale to make out the hieroglyphics, where any exist, their
date cannot now be ascertained.Consequently, these examples cannot yet
be used as the foundation of any argument on the subject, though the
curved form of the roofs in the Third Pyramid would alone be sufficient
to render it more than probable that during the period of the 4th
dynasty the Egyptians were familiar with this expedient.[99]

At Beni-Hasan, during the time of the 12th dynasty, curvilinear forms
reappear in the roofs (Woodcut No.16), used in such a manner as to
render it almost certain that they are copied from roofs of arcuate
construction.Behind the Rameseum at Thebes there are a series of arches
in brick, which seem undoubtedly to belong to the same age as the
building itself; and Sir G. Wilkinson mentions a tomb at Thebes, the
roof of which is vaulted with bricks, and still bears the name of
Amenoph I., of the 18th dynasty.[100]

The temple at Abydus, erected by Rameses II., shows the same peculiarity
as the tombs at Beni-Hasan, of a flat segmental arch thrown across
between the stone architraves.In this instance it is also a copy in
stone, but such as must have been originally copied from one of brick
construction.There is also every reason to believe that the apartments
of the little pavilion at Medeenet Habû (Woodcuts Nos.32 and 33) were
covered with semicircular vaults, though these have now
disappeared.Hoskins found stone arches vaulting the roofs of the
porches to the pyramids, perfect in construction, and, what is still
more singular, showing both circular and pointed forms (Woodcut No.These, as before remarked, are probably of the time of Tirhakah,
or at all events not earlier than the age of Solomon, nor later than
that of Cambyses.Section of Tomb near the Pyramids of Gizeh.]In the age of Psammeticus we have several stone arches in the
neighbourhood of the pyramids; one, in a tomb at Sakkara, has been
frequently drawn; but one of the most instructive is that in a tomb
discovered by Colonel Campbell (Woodcut No.101), showing a very
primitive form of an arch composed of 3 stones only, and above which is
another arch of regular construction of 4 courses.In his researches at
Nimroud, Layard discovered vaulted drains and chambers below the
north-west and south-east edifices, which were consequently as old as
the 8th or 9th century before our era, and contemporary with those in
the pyramids of Meroë.They were of both circular and pointed forms, and
built apparently with great care and attention to the principles of the
arch (Woodcut No.Vaulted Drain beneath the South-East Palace at
Nimroud.]The great discovery of this class is that of the city gates at
Khorsabad, which, as mentioned at p.181, were spanned by arches of
semicircular form, so perfect both in construction and in the mode in
which they were ornamented, as to prove that in the time of Sargon the
arch was a usual and well-understood building expedient, and one
consequently which we may fairly assume to have been long in use.Arch at Dêr-el-Bahree.On the other hand, we have in the temple at Dêr-el-Bahree in Thebes,
built by Thothmes III., a curious example of the retention of the old
form, when at first sight it would appear as though the true arch would
have been a more correct expedient.In this example, the lower arch is
composed of stones bracketing forward horizontally, though the form of
the arch is semicircular; and above this is a discharging arch of two
stones used as in the Pyramids.The upper arch is so arranged as to
relieve the crown of the lower—which is its weakest part—of all weight,
and at the same time to throw the whole pressure on the outer ends of
the arch stones, exactly where it is wanted.The whole thus becomes
constructively perfect, though it is a more expensive way of attaining
the end desired than by an arch.The truth seems to be, the Egyptians had not at this age invented
voussoirs deeper in the direction of the radii of the arch than in that
of its perimeter; and the arch with them was consequently not generally
an appropriate mode of roofing.It was the Romans with their tiles who
first really understood the true employment of the arch.So far as we can now understand from the discoveries that have been
made, it seems that the Assyrians used the pointed arch for tunnels,
aqueducts, and generally for underground work where they feared great
superincumbent pressure on the apex, and the round arch above-ground
where that was not to be dreaded; and in this they probably showed more
science and discrimination than we do in such works.Arch of the Cloaca Maxima, Rome.In Europe the oldest arch is probably that of Cloaca Maxima at Rome,
constructed under the early kings.It is of stone in 3 rims, and shows
as perfect a knowledge of the principle as any subsequent example.Its
lasting uninjured to the present day proves how well the art was then
understood, and, by inference, how long it must have been practised
before reaching that degree of perfection.From all this it becomes almost certain that the arch was used as early
as the times of the pyramid-builders of the 4th dynasty, and was copied
in the tombs of Beni-Hasan in the 12th; though it may be that the
earliest existing example cannot be dated further back than the first
kings of the 18th dynasty; from that time, however, there can be no
doubt that it was currently used, not only in Egypt, but also in
Ethiopia and Assyria.It would, indeed, be more difficult to account for the fact of such
perfect builders as the Egyptians being ignorant of the arch if such
were the case; though, at the same time, it is easy to understand why
they should use it so sparingly, as they did in their monumental
erections.Even in the simplest arch, that formed of only two stones, such as is
frequently found in the pyramids, and over the highest chamber (Woodcut
No.8), it will be evident that any weight placed on the apex has a
tendency to lower the summit, and press the lower ends of the stones
outwards.Where there was the whole mass of the pyramid to abut against,
this was of no consequence, but in a slighter building it would have
thrust the walls apart, and brought on inevitable ruin.The introduction of a third stone, as in the arch (Woodcut No.101),
hardly remedied this at all, the central stone acting like a wedge to
thrust the two others apart; and even the introduction of 2 more stones,
making 5, as in Woodcut No.105, only distributed the pressure without
remedying the defect; and without the most perfect masonry every
additional joint was only an additional source of weakness.Arches in the Pyramids at Meroë.This has been felt by the architects of all ages and in all countries:
still, the advantage of being able to cover large spaces with small
stones or bricks is so great, that many have been willing to run the
risk; and all the ingenuity of the Gothic architects of the Middle Ages
was applied to overcoming the difficulty.But even the best of their
buildings are unstable from this cause, and require constant care and
attention to keep them from falling.The Indian architects have fallen into the other extreme, refusing to
use the arch under any circumstances, and preferring the smallest
dimensions and the most crowded interiors, to adopting what they
consider so destructive an expedient.As mentioned in the Introduction
(page 22), their theory is that “an arch never sleeps,” and is
constantly tending to tear a building to pieces: and, where aided by
earthquakes and the roots of trees, there is only too much truth in
their belief.The Egyptians seem to have followed a middle course, using arches either
in tombs, where the rock formed an immovable abutment; or in pyramids
and buildings, where the mass immensely overpowered the thrust; or
underground, where the superincumbent earth prevented movement.They seem also to have used flat segmental arches of brickwork between
the rows of massive architraves which they placed on their pillars; and
as all these abutted one another, like the arches of a bridge, except
the external ones, which were sufficiently supported by the massive
walls, the mode of construction was a sound one.This is exactly that
which we have re-introduced during the last 30 years, in consequence of
the application of cast-iron beams, between which flat segmental arches
of brick are thrown, when we desire to introduce a more solid and
fire-proof construction than is possible with wood only.In their use of the arch, as in everything else, the building science of
the Egyptians seems to have been governed by the soundest principles and
the most perfect knowledge of what was judicious and expedient, and what
should be avoided.Many of their smaller edifices have no doubt perished
from the scarcity of wood forcing the builders to employ brick arches,
but they wisely avoided the use of these in all their larger
monuments—in all, in fact, which they wished should endure to the latest
posterity.CHRONOLOGICAL MEMORANDA CONNECTED WITH ARCHITECTURE.Moses      B.C.1312

The Jews, like the other Semitic races, were not a building people, and
never aspired to monumental magnificence as a mode of perpetuating the
memory of their greatness.The palace of Solomon was wholly of cedar
wood, and must have perished of natural decay in a few centuries, if it
escaped fire and other accidents incident to such temporary structures.Their first temple was a tent, their second depended almost entirely on
its metallic ornaments for its splendour, and it was not till the Greeks
and Romans taught them how to apply stone and stone carving for this
purpose that we have anything that can be called architecture in the
true sense of the term.This deficiency of monuments is, however, by no means peculiar to the
Jewish people.As before observed, we should know hardly anything of the
architecture of Assyria but for the existence of the wainscot slabs of
their palaces, though they were nearly a purely Semitic people, but
their art rested on a Turanian basis.Neither Tyre nor Sidon have left
us a single monument; nor Utica nor Carthage one vestige that dates
anterior to the Roman period.What is found at Jerusalem, at Baalbec, at
Palmyra, or Petra, even in the countries beyond the Jordan, is all
Roman.What little traces of Phœnician art are picked up in the
countries bordering on the Mediterranean are copies, with Egyptian or
Grecian details, badly and unintelligently copied, and showing a want of
appreciation of the first principles of art that is remarkable in that
age.It is therefore an immense gain if by our knowledge of Assyrian art
we are enabled, even in a moderate degree, to realise the form of
buildings which have long ceased to exist, and are only known to us from
verbal descriptions.Diagram Plan of Solomon’s Palace.The most celebrated secular building of the Jews was the palace which
Solomon was occupied in building during the thirteen years which
followed his completion of the Temple.As not one vestige of this
celebrated building remains, and even its site is a matter of dispute,
the annexed plan must be taken only as an attempt to apply the knowledge
we have acquired in Assyria and Judea to the elucidation of the
descriptions of the Bible and Josephus,[102] and as such may be
considered of sufficient interest to deserve a place in the History of
Architecture.The principal apartment here, as in all Eastern palaces, was the great
audience hall, in this instance 150 feet in length by 75 in width; the
roof composed of cedar, and, like the Ninevite palaces, supported by
rows of cedar pillars on the floor.According to Josephus, who, however,
never saw it, and had evidently the Roman Stoa Basilica of the Temple in
his eye, the section would probably have been as shown in diagram A. But
the contemporary Bible narrative, which is the real authority, would
almost certainly point to something more like the Diagram B in the
annexed woodcut.Diagram Sections of the House of the Cedars of
Lebanon.]Next in importance to this was the Porch, which was the audience or
reception hall, attached to the private apartments; these two being the
Dewanni Aum and Dewanni Khas of Eastern palaces, at this day.The Hall
of Judgment we may venture to restore with confidence, from what we find
at Persepolis and Khorsabad; and the courts are arranged in the diagram
as they were found in Ninevite palaces.They are proportioned, so far as
we can now judge, to those parts of which the dimensions are given by
the authorities, and to the best estimate we can now make of what would
be most suitable to Solomon’s state, and to such a capital as Jerusalem
was at that time.From Josephus we learn that Solomon built the walls of this palace “with
stones 10 cubits in length, and wainscoted them with stones that were
sawed and were of great value, such as are dug out of the earth for the
ornaments of temples and the adornment of palaces.”[103] These were
ornamented with sculptures in three rows, but the fourth or upper row
was the most remarkable, being covered with foliage in relief, of the
most exquisite workmanship; above this the walls were plastered and
ornamented with paintings in colour: all of which is the exact
counterpart of what we find at Nineveh.From the knowledge we now possess of Assyrian palaces it might indeed be
possible to restore this building with fairly approximate correctness,
but it would hardly be worth while to attempt this except in a work
especially devoted to Jewish art.For the present it must suffice to
know that the affinities of the architecture of Solomon’s age were
certainly Assyrian; and from our knowledge of the one we may pretty
accurately realise the form of the other.TEMPLE OF JERUSALEM.Although not one stone remains upon another of the celebrated Temple of
Jerusalem, still, the descriptions in the Bible and Josephus are so
precise, that now that we are able to interpret them by the light of
other buildings, its history can be written with very tolerable
certainty.The earliest temple of the Jews was the Tabernacle, the plan of which
they always considered as divinely revealed to them through Moses in the
desert of Sinai, and from which they consequently never departed in any
subsequent erections.Its dimensions were for the cella, or Holy of
Holies, 10 cubits or 15 ft.cube; for the outer temple, two such cubes
or 15 ft.These were covered by the sloping roofs of the tent,
which extended 5 cubits in every direction beyond the temple itself,
making the whole 40 cubits or 60 ft.in length by 20 cubits or 30 ft.These stood within an enclosure 100 cubits long by 50 cubits
wide.[104]

[Illustration: 108.The Tabernacle, showing one half ground plan and one
half as covered by the curtains.]1015) built the Temple, he did not alter the
disposition in any manner, but adopted it literally, only doubling every
dimension.Thus the Holy of Holies became a cube of 20 cubits; the Holy
place, 20 by 40; the porch and the chambers which surrounded it 10
cubits each, making a total of 80 cubits or 120 ft.by 40 cubits or 60
ft., with a height of 30 as compared with 15, which was the height of
the ridge of the Tabernacle, and it was surrounded by a court the
dimensions of which were 200 cubits in length by 100 in width.Even with these increased dimensions the Temple was a very insignificant
building in size: the truth being that, like the temples of Semitic
nations, it was more in the character of a shrine or of a treasury
intended to contain certain precious works in metal.South-East View of the Tabernacle, as restored by
the Author.]The principal ornaments of its façade were two brazen pillars, Jachin
and Boaz, which seem to have been wonders of metal work, and regarding
which more has been written, and it may be added, more nonsense, than
regarding almost any other known architectural objects.The truth of the
matter appears to be that the translators of our Bibles in no instance
were architects, and none of the architects who have attempted the
restoration were learned as Hebrew scholars; and consequently the truth
has fallen to the ground between the two.A brazen pillar, however, 18
cubits high and 12 cubits in circumference—6 ft.in diameter—is an
absurdity that no brass-founder ever could have perpetrated.In the
Hebrew, the 15th verse reads: “He cast two pillars of brass, 18 cubits
was the height of the one pillar, and a line of 12 cubits encompassed
the other pillar.”[105] The truth of the matter seems to be that what
Solomon erected was a screen (chapiter) consisting of two parts, one 4
cubits, the other 5 cubits in height, and supported by two pillars of
metal, certainly not more than 1 cubit in diameter, and standing 12
cubits apart: nor does it seem difficult to perceive what purpose this
screen was designed to effect.As will be observed, in the restoration
of the Tabernacle (Woodcut No.109), the whole of the light to the
interior is admitted from the front.In the Temple the only light that
could penetrate to the Holy of Holies was from the front also; and
though the Holy place was partially lighted from the sides, its
principal source of light must have been through the eastern façade.In
consequence of this there must have been a large opening or window in
this front, and as a window was a thing that they had not yet learned to
make an ornamental feature in architectural design, they took this mode
of screening and partially, at least, hiding it.It becomes almost absolutely certain that this is the true solution of
the riddle, when we find that when Herod rebuilt the Temple in the first
century B.C., he erected a similar screen for the same purpose in front
of his Temple.Its dimensions, however, were one-third larger.It was 40
cubits high, and 20 cubits across, and it supported five beams instead
of two;[106] not to display the chequer-work and pomegranates of
Solomon’s screen, but to carry the Golden Vine, which was the principal
ornament of the façade of the Temple in its latest form.[107]

[Illustration: 110.Plan of Solomon’s Temple, showing the disposition of
the chambers in two storeys.]Although it is easy to understand how it was quite possible in metal
work to introduce all the ornaments enumerated in the Bible, and with
gilding and colour to make these objects of wonder, we have no examples
with which we can compare them, and any restoration must consequently be
somewhat fanciful.Still, we must recollect that this was the “bronze
age” of architecture.Homer tells us of the brazen house of Priam, and
the brazen palace of Alcinous; the Treasuries at Mycenæ were covered
internally with bronze plates; and in Etruscan tombs of this age metal
was far more essentially the material of decoration than carving in
stone, or any of the modes afterwards so frequently adopted.The altar
of the Temple was of brass.The molten sea, supported by twelve brazen
oxen; the bases, the lavers, and all the other objects in metal work,
were in reality what made the Temple so celebrated; and very little was
due to the mere masonry by which we should judge of a Christian church
or any modern building.No pillars are mentioned as supporting the roof, but every analogy
derived from Persian architecture, as well as the constructive
necessities of the case, would lead us to suppose they must have
existed, four in the sanctuary and eight in the pronaos.Plan of Temple at Jerusalem, as rebuilt by Herod.The temple which Ezekiel saw in a vision on the banks of the Chebar was
identical in dimensions with that of Solomon, in so far as naos and
pronaos were concerned.But a passage round the naos was introduced,
giving access to the chambers, which added 10 cubits to its dimensions
every way, making it 100 cubits by 60.The principal court, which
contained the Altar and the Temple properly so called, had the same
dimensions as in Solomon’s Temple; but he added, in imagination at
least, four courts, each 100 cubits or 150 ft.That on the east
certainly existed, and seems to have been the new court of Solomon’s
Temple,[108] and is what in that of Herod became the court of the
Gentiles.The north and south courts were never apparently carried out.They did not exist in Solomon’s Temple, and there is evidence to show
that they were not found in Zerubbabel’s.[109] That on the north-west
angle was the citadel of the Temple, where the treasures were kept, and
which was afterwards replaced by the Tower Antonia.View of the Temple from the East, as it appeared at
the time of the Crucifixion.When the Jews returned from the Captivity they rebuilt the Temple
exactly as it had been described by Ezekiel, in so far as dimensions are
concerned, except that, as just mentioned, they do not seem to have been
able to accomplish the northern and southern courts.The materials, however, were probably inferior to the original Temple;
and we hear nothing of brazen pillars in the porch, nor of the splendid
vessels and furniture which made the glory of Solomon’s Temple, so that
the Jews were probably justified in mourning over its comparative
insignificance.[110]

In the last Temple we have a perfect illustration of the mode in which
the architectural enterprises of that country were carried out.The
priests restored the Temple itself, not venturing to alter a single one
of its sacred dimensions, only adding wings to the façade so as to make
it 100 cubits wide, and it is said 100 cubits high, while the length
remained 100 cubits as before.[111] At this period, however, Judea was
under the sway of the Romans and under the influence of their ideas, and
the outer courts were added with a magnificence of which former builders
had no conception, but bore strongly the impress of the architectural
magnificence of the Romans.An area measuring 600 feet each way was enclosed by terraced walls of
the utmost lithic grandeur.On these were erected porticoes unsurpassed
by any we know of.One, the Stoa Basilica, had a section equal to that
of our largest cathedrals, and surpassed them all in length, and within
this colonnaded enclosure were ten great gateways, two of which were of
surpassing magnificence: the whole making up a rich and varied pile
worthy of the Roman love of architectural display, but in singular
contrast with the modest aspirations of a purely Semitic people.It is always extremely difficult to restore any building from mere
verbal description, and still more so when erected by a people of whose
architecture we know so little as we do of that of the Jews.Still, the
woodcut on the opposite page is probably not very far from representing
the Temple as it was after the last restoration by Herod, barring of
course the screen bearing the Vine mentioned above, which is omitted.Without attempting to justify every detail, it seems such a mixture of
Roman with Phœnician forms as might be expected and is warranted by
Josephus’s description.There is no feature for which authority could
not be quoted, but the difficulty is to know whether or not the example
adduced is the right one, or the one which bears most directly on the
subject.After all, perhaps, its principal defect is that it does not
(how can a modern restoration?)do justice to the grandeur and beauty of
the whole.As it has been necessary to anticipate the chronological sequence of
events in order not to separate the temples of the Jews from one
another, it may be as well before proceeding further to allude to
several temples similarly situated which apparently were originally
Semitic shrines but rebuilt in Roman times.That at Palmyra, for
instance, is a building very closely resembling that at Jerusalem, in so
far at least as the outer enclosure is concerned.[112] It consists of a
cloistered enclosure of somewhat larger dimensions, measuring externally
730 ft.by 715, with a small temple of an anomalous form in the centre.It wants, however, all the inner enclosures and curious substructures of
the Jewish fane; but this may have arisen from its having been rebuilt
in late Roman times, and consequently shorn of these peculiarities.It
is so similar, however, that it must be regarded as a cognate temple to
that at Jerusalem, though re-erected by a people of another race.A third temple, apparently very similar to these, is that of Kangovar in
Persia.[113] Only a portion now remains of the great court in which it
stood, and which was nearly of the same dimensions as those of Jerusalem
and Palmyra, being 660 ft.In the centre are the vestiges of a
small temple.At Aizaini in Asia Minor[114] is a fourth, with a similar
court; but here the temple is more important, and assumes more
distinctly the forms of a regular Roman peristylar temple of the usual
form, though still small and insignificant for so considerable an
enclosure.The mosque of Damascus was once one of these great square
temple-enclosures, with a small temple, properly so called, in the
centre.It may have been as magnificent, perhaps more so, than any of
these just enumerated, but it has been so altered by Christian and
Moslem rebuildings, that it is almost impossible now to make out what
its original form may have been.None of these are original buildings, but still, when put together and
compared the one with the other, and, above all, when examined by the
light which discoveries farther east have enabled us to throw on the
subject, they enable us to restore this style in something like its
pristine form.At present, it is true, they are but the scattered
fragments of an art of which it is feared no original specimens now
remain, and which can only therefore be recovered by induction from
similar cognate examples of other, though allied, styles of art.Historical notice—Tombs at Smyrna—Doganlu—Lycian tombs.It is now perhaps in vain to expect that any monuments of the most
ancient times, of great extent or of great architectural importance,
remain to be discovered in Asia Minor; still, it is a storehouse from
which much information may yet be gleaned, and whence we may expect the
solution of many dark historical problems, if ever they are to be solved
at all.Situated as that country is, in the very centre of the old world,
surrounded on three sides by navigable seas opening all the regions of
the world to her commerce, possessing splendid harbours, a rich soil,
and the finest climate of the whole earth, it must not only have been
inhabited at the earliest period of history, but must have risen to a
pitch of civilisation at a time preceding any written histories that we
possess.We may recollect that, in the time of Psammeticus, Phrygia
contended with Egypt for the palm of antiquity, and from the monuments
of the 18th dynasty we know what rich spoil, what beautiful vases of
gold, and other tributes of a rich and luxurious people, the Pout and
Roteno and other inhabitants of Asia Minor brought and laid at the feet
of Thothmes and other early kings eighteen centuries at least before the
Christian era.At a later period (716 to 547 B.C.)the Lydian empire was one of the
richest and most powerful in Asia; and contemporary with this and for a
long period subsequent to it, the Ionian colonies of Greece surpassed
the mother country in wealth and refinement, and almost rivalled her in
literature and art.Few cities of the ancient world surpassed Ephesus,
Sardis, or Halicarnassus in splendour; and Troy, Tarsus, and Trebisond
mark three great epochs in the history of Asia Minor which are
unsurpassed in interest and political importance by the retrospect of
any cities of the world.Excepting, however, the remains of the Greek
and Roman periods—the great temples of the first, and the great theatres
of the latter period—little that is architectural remains in this once
favoured land.It happens also unfortunately that there was no great
capital city—no central point—where we can look for monuments of
importance.The defect in the physical geography of the country is that
it has no great river running through it—no vast central plain capable
of supporting a population sufficiently great to overpower the rest and
to give unity to the whole.Elevation of Tumulus at Tantalais.(From Texier’s
‘Asie Mineure.’) 100 ft.Plan and Section of Chamber in Tumulus at
Tantalais.]So far as our researches yet reach, it would seem that the oldest
remains still found in Asia Minor are the tumuli of Tantalais, on the
northern shore of the Gulf of Smyrna.They seem as if left there most
opportunely to authenticate the tradition of the Etruscans having sailed
from this port for Italy.One of these is represented in Woodcuts Nos.Though these tumuli are built wholly of stone, no one
familiar with architectural resemblances can fail to see in them a
common origin with those of Etruria.The stylobate, the sloping sides,
the inner chamber, with its pointed roof, all the arrangements, indeed,
are the same, and the whole character of the necropolis at Tantalais
would be as appropriate at Tarquinii or Cæræ as at Smyrna.Another tumulus of equal interest historically is that of Alyattes, near
Sardis, described with such care by Herodotus,[115] and which was
explored 35 years ago by Spiegelthal, the Prussian consul at
Smyrna.[116] According to the measurements of Herodotus, it was either
3800 or 4100 ft.in circumference; at present it is found to be 1180 ft.in diameter, and consequently about 3700 ft.in circumference at the top
of the basement, though of course considerably more below.It is
situated on the edge of a rocky ridge, which is made level on one side
by a terrace-wall of large stones, 60 ft.in height; above this the
mound rises to the height of 142 ft.: the total height above the plain
being 228 ft.The upper part of the mound is composed of alternate
layers of clay, loam, and a kind of rubble concrete.These support a
mass of brickwork, surmounted by a platform of masonry; on this one of
the steles described by Herodotus still lies, and one of the smaller
ones was found close by.The funereal chamber was discovered resting on the rock at about 160 ft.high; the roof flat and composed of large stones, on which
rested a layer of charcoal and ashes, 2 ft.in thickness, evidently the
remains of the offerings which had been made after the chamber was
closed, but before the mound had been raised over it.There are in the same locality an immense number of tumuli of various
dimensions, among which Herr Spiegelthal fancies he can discriminate
three classes, belonging to three distinct ages; that of Alyattes
belonging to the most modern.This is extremely probable, as at this
time (B.C.561) the fashion of erecting tumuli as monuments was dying
out in this part of the world, though it continued in less civilised
parts of Europe till long after the Christian era.The tumuli that still adorn the Plain of Troy are probably contemporary
with the oldest of the three groups of those around the Gygean Lake.Indeed, there does not seem much reason for doubting that they were
really raised over the ashes of the heroes who took part in that
memorable struggle, and whose names they still bear.The recent explorations of these mounds do not seem to have thrown much
light on the subject, but if we can trust the account Chevalier gives of
his researches at the end of the last century, the case is clear enough,
and there can be very little doubt but that the Dios Tepe on the Sigæan
promontory is really the tomb of Achilles.[117] Intensely interesting
though they are in other respects, Schliemann’s discoveries on the site
of Troy have done very little to increase our knowledge of the
architecture of the period.This may partly be owing to his ignorance of
the art, and to his having no architect with him, but it does not appear
that any architectural mouldings were discovered earlier than those of
“Ilium Novum,” two or three centuries before Christ.The so-called
Temple of Minerva was without pillars or mouldings of any sort, and the
walls and gates of the old city were equally devoid of ornament.What
was found seems to confirm the idea that the Trojans were a
Turanian-Pelasgic people burying their dead in mounds, and revelling in
barbaric splendour, but not having reached that degree of civilisation
which would induce them to seek to perpetuate their forms of art in more
permanent materials than earth and metals.[118]


It is not clear whether any other great groups of tumuli exist in Asia
Minor, but it seems more than probable that in the earliest times the
whole of this country was inhabited by a Pelasgic race, who were the
first known occupants of Greece, and who built the so-called Treasuries
of Mycenæ and Orchomenos, and who sent forth the Etruscans to civilise
Italy.If this be so, it accounts for the absence of architectural
remains, for they would have left behind them no buildings but the
sepulchres of their departed great ones; and if their history is to be
recovered, it must be sought for in the bowels of the earth, and not in
anything existing above-ground.Next to these in point of age and style comes a curious group of
rock-cut monuments, found in the centre of the land at Doganlu.They are
placed on the rocky side of a narrow valley, and are unconnected
apparently with any great city or centre of population.Generally they
are called tombs, but there are no chambers nor anything about them to
indicate a funereal purpose, and the inscriptions which accompany them
are not on the monuments themselves, nor do they refer to such a
destination.Altogether they are certainly among the most mysterious
remains of antiquity, and, beyond a certain similarity to the rock-cut
tombs around Persepolis, present no features that afford even a remote
analogy to other monuments which might guide us in our conjectures as to
the purpose for which they were designed.They are of a style of art
clearly indicating a wooden origin, and consist of a square
frontispiece, either carved into certain geometric shapes, or apparently
prepared for painting; at each side is a flat pilaster, and above a
pediment terminating in two scrolls.Some—apparently the more
modern—have pillars of a rude Doric order, and all indeed are much more
singular than beautiful.When more of the same class are discovered,
they may help us to some historic data: all that we can now advance is,
that, judging from the inscriptions on them and the traditions in
Herodotus, they would appear to belong to some race from Thessaly, or
thereabouts, who at some remote period crossed the Hellespont and
settled in their neighbourhood; they may be dated as far back as 1000,
and most probably 700 years at least before the Christian Era.Rock-cut Frontispiece at Doganlu.(From Texier’s
‘Asie Mineure.’)]

There are other rock-cut sculptures farther east, at Pterium and
elsewhere; but all these are figure sculptures, without architectural
form or details, and therefore hardly coming within the limits of this
work.The only remaining important architectural group in Asia Minor is that
of Lycia, made known in this country since the year 1838, by the
investigations of Sir Charles Fellows and others.Interesting though
they certainly are, they are extremely disheartening to any one looking
for earlier remains in this land,—inasmuch as all of them, and more
especially the older ones, indicate distinctly a wooden origin—more
strongly perhaps than any architectural remains in the Western world.The oldest of them cannot well be carried farther back than the Persian
conquest of Cyrus and Harpagus.In other words, it seems perfectly
evident that up to that period the Lycians used only wood for their
buildings, and that it was only at that time, and probably from the
Greeks or Egyptians, that they, like the Persians themselves, first
learnt to substitute for their frail and perishable structures others of
a more durable material.As already observed, the same process can be traced in Egypt in the
earliest ages.In Central Asia the change was effected by the Persians.In India between the 2nd and 3rd centuries B.C.In Greece—in what was
not borrowed from the Egyptians—the change took place a little earlier
than in Lycia, or say in the 7th century B.C.What is important to
observe here is that, wherever the process can be detected, it is in
vain to look for earlier buildings.It is only in the infancy of stone
architecture that men adhere to wooden forms; and as soon as habit gives
them familiarity with the new material they abandon the incongruities of
the style, and we lose all trace of the original form, which never
reappears at an after age.All the original buildings of Lycia are tombs or monumental erections of
some kind, and generally may be classed under two heads, those having
curvilinear and those having rectilinear roofs, of both which classes
examples are found structural—or standing alone—as well as rock-cut.It consists
first of a double podium, which may have been in all cases, or at least
generally, of stone.Above this is a rectangular chest or sarcophagus,
certainly copied from a wooden form; all the mortises and framing, even
to the pins that held them together, being literally rendered in the
stonework.Above this is a curvilinear roof of pointed form, which also
is in all its parts a copy of an original in wood.The staves or bearers of the lower portion of the chest or sarcophagus
would suggest that the original feature was a portable ark, the upper
portion of which was framed in bamboo or some pliable wood tied together
by cross timbers or purlins which are carved on the principal front.A
somewhat similar scheme of construction is shown in the Chaityas of the
Buddhist temples, which are supposed to have been copies of wooden
structures not dissimilar to the Toda Mant huts which are built by the
Hindus down to the present day.[119]

When these forms are repeated in the rock the stylobate is omitted, and
only the upper part represented, as shown in the annexed woodcut (No.When the curvilinear roof is omitted, a flat one is substituted, nearly
similar to those common in the country at the present day, consisting of
beams of unsquared timber, laid side by side as close as they can be
laid, and over this a mass of concrete or clay, sufficiently thick to
prevent the rain from penetrating through.Sometimes this is surmounted
by a low pediment, and sometimes the lower framing also stands out from
the rock, so as to give the entrance of the tomb something of a
porchlike form.Both these forms are illustrated in the two woodcuts
(Nos.119 and 120), and numerous varieties of them are shown in the
works of Sir Charles Fellows and others, all containing the same
elements, and betraying most distinctly the wooden origin from which
they were derived.(From Texier’s ‘Asie Mineure.’)]

The last form that these buildings took was in the substitution of an
Ionic façade for these carpentry forms: this was not done apparently at
once, for, though the Ionic form was evidently borrowed from the
neighbouring Greek cities, it was only adopted by degrees, and even then
betrayed more strongly the wooden forms from which its entablature was
derived than is usually found in other or more purely Grecian examples.As soon as it had fairly gained a footing, the wooden style was
abandoned, and a masonry one substituted in its stead.The whole change
took place in this country probably within a century; but this is not a
fair test of the time such a process usually takes, as here it was
evidently done under foreign influence and with the spur given by the
example of a stone-building people.We have no knowledge of how long it
took in Egypt to effect the transformation.In India, where the form and
construction of the older Buddhist temples resemble so singularly these
examples in Lycia, the process can be traced through five or six
centuries; and in Persia it took perhaps nearly as long to convert the
wooden designs of the Assyrians into even the imperfect stone
architecture of the Achæmenians.Even in their best and most perfect
buildings, however, much remained to be done before the carpentry types
were fairly got rid of and the style became entitled to rank among the
masonic arts of the world.The remaining ancient buildings of Asia Minor were all built by the
Greeks and Romans, each in their own style, so that their classification
and description belong properly to the chapters treating of the
architectural history of those nations, from which they cannot properly
be separated, although it is at the same time undoubtedly true that the
purely European forms of the art were considerably modified by the
influence on them of local Asiatic forms and feelings.The Ionic order,
for instance, which arose in the Grecian colonies on the coast, is only
the native style of this country Doricised, if the expression may be
used.In other words, the local method of building had become so
modified and altered by the Greeks in adapting it to the Doric, which
had become the typical style with them, as to cause the loss of almost
all its original Asiatic forms.It thus became essentially a stone
architecture with external columns, instead of a style indulging only in
wooden pillars, and those used internally, as there is every reason to
suppose was the earlier form of the art.The Ionic style, thus composed
of two elements, took the arrangement of the temples from the Doric, and
their details from the Asiatic original.The Roman temples, on the
contrary, which have been erected in this part of the world, in their
columns and other details exactly follow the buildings at Rome itself:
while, as in the instances above quoted of Jerusalem, Palmyra, Kangovar,
and others, the essential forms and arrangements are all local and
Asiatic.The former are Greek temples with Asiatic details, the latter
Asiatic temples with only Roman masonic forms.The Greeks, in fact, were
colonists, the Romans only conquerors; and hence the striking difference
in the style of Asiatic art executed under their respective influence.We shall have frequent occasion in the sequel to refer to this
difference.Though not strictly within the geographical limits of this chapter,
there is a group of tombs at Amrith—the ancient Marathos, on the coast
of Syria—which are too interesting to be passed over; but so exceptional
in the present state of our knowledge, that it is difficult to assign
them their proper place anywhere.The principal monument, represented in woodcut No.in height, composed of very large blocks of stone and situated over a
sepulchral cavern.There is no inscription or indication to enable us to
fix its date with certainty.[120] The details of its architecture might
be called Assyrian; but we know of nothing in that country that at all
resembles it.On the other hand there is a moulding on its base, which,
if correctly drawn, would appear to be of Roman origin; and there is a
look about the lions that would lead us to suspect they were carved
under Greek influence—after the age of Alexander at least.Elevation of the Monument and Section of the Tomb at
Amrith.[121])]

The interest consists in its being almost the only perfect survivor of a
class of monuments at one time probably very common; but which we are
led to believe from the style of ornamentation were generally in brick.It is also suggestive, from its close resemblance to the Buddhist topes
in Afghanistan and India; the tall form of those, especially in the
first-named country, and their universally domical outline, point
unmistakably to some such original as this: and lastly, were I asked to
point out the building in the old world which most resembled the stele
which Herod erected over the Tombs of the Kings at Jerusalem, in
expiation of his desecration of their sanctity,[122] this is the
monument to which I should unhesitatingly refer.(From
Wordsworth’s ‘Athens.’[123])]

Till within a very recent period the histories of Greece and Rome have
been considered as the ancient histories of the world; and even now, in
our universities and public schools, it is scarcely acknowledged that a
more ancient record has been read on the monuments of Egypt and dug out
of the bowels of the earth in Assyria.It is nevertheless true that the decipherment of the hieroglyphics on
the one hand, and the reading of the arrow-headed characters on the
other, have disclosed to us two forms of civilisation anterior to that
which reappeared in Greece in the 8th century before Christ.Based on
those that preceded it, the Hellenic form developed itself there with a
degree of perfection never before seen, nor has it, in its own peculiar
department, ever been since surpassed.These discoveries have been of the utmost importance, not only in
correcting our hitherto narrow views of ancient history, but in
assisting to explain much that was obscure, or utterly unintelligible,
in those histories with which we were more immediately familiar.We now,
for the first time, comprehend whence the Greeks obtained many of their
arts and much of their civilisation, and to what extent the character of
these was affected by the sources from which they were derived.Having already described the artistic forms of Egypt and Assyria, it is
not difficult to discover the origin of almost every idea, and of every
architectural feature, that was afterwards found in Greece.But even
with this assistance we should not be able to understand the phenomena
which Greek art presents to us, were it not that the monuments reveal to
us the existence of two distinct and separate races existing
contemporaneously in Greece.If the Greeks were as purely Aryan as their
language would lead us to believe, all our ethnographic theories are at
fault.But this is precisely one of those cases where archæology steps
in to supplement what philology tells us and to elucidate what that
science fails to reveal.That the language of the Greeks, with the
smallest possible admixture from other sources, is pure Aryan, no one
will dispute: but their arts, their religion, and frequently their
institutions, tend to ascribe to them an altogether different origin.Fortunately the ruins at Mycenæ and Orchomenos are sufficient to afford
us a key to the mystery.From them we learn that at the time of the war
of Troy a people were supreme in Greece who were not Hellenes, but who
were closely allied to the Etruscans and other tomb-building, art-loving
races.Whether they were purely Turanian, or merely ultra-Celtic, may be
questioned; but one thing seems clear, that this people were then known
to the ancients under the name of Pelasgi, and it is their presence in
Greece, mixed up with the more purely Dorian races, which explains what
would otherwise be unintelligible in Grecian civilisation.Except from our knowledge of the existence of a strong infusion of
Turanian blood into the veins of the Grecian people, it would be
impossible to understand how a people so purely Aryan in appearance came
to adopt a religion so essentially Anthropic and Ancestral.Their belief
in oracles, their worship of trees,[124] and many minor peculiarities,
were altogether abhorrent to the Aryan mind.The existence of these two antagonistic elements satisfactorily explains
how it was that while art was unknown in the purely Dorian city of
Sparta, it flourished so exuberantly in the quasi-Pelasgic city of
Athens; why the Dorians borrowed their architectural order from Egypt,
and hardly changed its form during the long period they employed it; and
how it came to pass that the eastern art of the Persians was brought
into Greece, and how it was there modified so essentially that we hardly
recognise the original in its altered and more perfect form.It
explains, too, how the different States of Greece were artistic or
matter-of-fact in the exact proportion in which either of the two
elements predominated in the people.Thus the poetry of Arcadia was unknown in the neighbouring State of
Sparta; but the Doric race there remained true to their institutions and
spread their colonies and their power farther than any other of the
little principalities of Greece.The institutions of Lycurgus could
never have been maintained in Athens; but, on the other hand, the
Parthenon was as impossible in the Lacedemonian State.Even in Athens
art would not have been the wonder that it became without that happy
admixture of the two races which then prevailed, mingling the common
sense of the one with the artistic feeling of the other, which tended to
produce the most brilliant intellectual development which has yet
dazzled the world with its splendour.The contemporary presence of these two races perhaps also explains how
Greek civilisation, though so wonderfully brilliant, passed so quickly
away.Had either race been pure, the Dorian institutions might have
lasted as long as the village-systems of India or the arts of Egypt or
China; but where two dissimilar races mix, the tendency is inevitably to
revert to the type of one, and, though the intermixture may produce a
stock more brilliant than either parent, the type is less permanent and
soon passes away.So soon was it the case, in this instance, that the
whole of the great history of Greece may be said to be comprehended in
the period ranging between the battle of Marathon (B.C.490) and the
peace concluded with Philip of Macedon by the Athenians (B.C.346): so
that the son of a man who was born before the first event may have been
a party to the second.All those wonders of patriotism, of poetry, and
art, for which Greece was famous, crowded into the short space of a
century and a half, is a phenomenon the like of which the world has not
seen before, and is not likely to witness again.As might be expected, from the length of time that has elapsed since the
Pelasgic races ruled in Greece, and owing to the numerous changes that
have taken place in that country since their day, their architectural
remains are few, and comparatively insignificant.It has thus come to
pass that, were it not for their tombs, their city walls, and their
works of civil engineering, such as bridges and tunnels—in which they
were pre-eminent—we should hardly now possess any material remains to
prove their existence or mark the degree of civilisation to which they
had reached.Section and Plan of Tomb of Atreus at Mycenæ.The most remarkable of these remains are the tombs of the kings of
Mycenæ, a city which in Homeric times had a fair title to be considered
the capital of Greece, or at all events to be considered one of the most
important of her cities.The Dorians described these as treasuries, from
the number of precious objects found in them, as in the tombs of the
Etruscans, and because they looked upon such halls as far more than
sufficient for the narrow dwellings of the dead.The most perfect and
the largest of them now existing is known as the Treasury or Tomb of
Atreus at Mycenæ, shown in plan and section in the annexed woodcut.The
principal chamber is 48 ft.in diameter, and is, or was when
perfect, of the shape of a regular equilateral pointed arch, a form well
adapted to the mode of construction, which is that of horizontal layers
of stones, projecting the one beyond the other, till one small stone
closed the whole, and made the vault complete.As will be explained further on, this was the form of dome adopted by
the Jaina architects in India.It prevailed also in Italy and Asia Minor
wherever a Pelasgic race is traced, down to the time when the pointed
form again came into use in the Middle Ages, though it was not then used
as a horizontal, but as a radiating arch.On one side of this hall is a chamber cut in the rock, the true
sepulchre apparently, and externally is a long passage leading to a
doorway, which, judging from the fragments that remain (Woodcut No.125), must have been of a purely Asiatic form of art, and very unlike
anything found subsequent to this period in Greece.Fragment of Pillar in front of Tomb of Atreus at
Mycenæ.]To all appearance the dome was lined internally with plates of brass or
bronze, some nails of which metals are now found there; and the holes in
which the nails were inserted are still to be seen all over the place.A
second tomb or treasury of smaller dimensions was discovered by Dr.Another of these tombs, erected by Minyas at
Orchomenos, described by Pausanias as one of the wonders of Greece,[125]
seems from the remains still existing to have been at least 20 ft.wider
than this one, and proportionably larger in every respect.All these
were covered with earth, and some are probably still hidden which a
diligent search might reveal.Schliemann’s discoveries in
the Acropolis of Mycenæ and in the Troad prove that it is still possible
to discover an unrifled tomb even in Greece.As domes constructed on the horizontal principle, these three are the
largest of which we have any knowledge, though there does not appear to
be any reasonable limit to the extent to which such a form of building
might be carried.When backed by earth,[126] as these were, it is
evident, from the mode of construction, that they cannot be destroyed by
any equable pressure exerted from the exterior.The only danger to be feared is, what is technically called a rising of
the haunches; and to avoid this it might be necessary, where large domes
were attempted, to adopt a form more nearly conical than that used at
Mycenæ.This might be a less pleasing architectural feature, but it is
constructively a better one than the form of the radiating domes we
generally employ.It is certainly to be regretted that more of the decorative features of
this early style have not been discovered.They differ so entirely from
anything else in Greece, and are so purely Asiatic in form, that it
would be exceedingly interesting to be able to restore a complete
decoration of any sort.In all the parts hitherto brought to light, an
Ionic-like scroll is repeated in every part and over every detail,
rather rudely executed, but probably originally heightened by colour.Its counterparts are found in Assyria and at Persepolis, but nowhere
else in Greece.[127]

[Illustration: 126.(From Dodwell’s ‘Greece.’)]

The Pelasgic races soon learnt to adopt for their doorways the more
pleasing curvilinear form with which they were already familiar from
their interiors.126) from a
gateway at Thoricus, in Attica, serves to show its simplest and earliest
form; and the illustration (Woodcut No.129) from Assos, in Asia Minor,
of a far more modern date, shows the most complicated form it took in
ancient times.In this last instance it is merely a discharging arch,
and so little fitted for the purpose to which it is applied, that we can
only suppose that its adoption arose from a strong predilection for this
shape.Another illustration of Pelasgic masonry is found at Delos (Woodcut No.127), consisting of a roof formed by two arch stones, at a certain angle
to one another, similar to the plan adopted in Egypt, and is further
interesting as being associated with capitals of pillars formed of the
front part of bulls, as in Assyria, pointing again to the intimate
connection that existed between Greece and Asia at this early period of
the former’s history.(From Stuart’s ‘Athens.’)]

In all these instances it does not seem to have been so much want of
knowledge that led these early builders to adopt the horizontal in
preference to the radiating principle, as a conviction of its greater
durability, as well, perhaps, as a certain predilection for an ancient
mode.In the construction of their walls they adhered, as a mere matter of
taste, to forms which they must have known to be inferior to others.In
the example, for instance, of a wall in the Peloponnesus (woodcut No.128), we find the polygonal masonry of an earlier age actually placed
upon as perfect a specimen built in regular courses, or what is
technically called _ashlar_ work, as any to be found in Greece; and on
the other side of the gateway at Assos (Woodcut No.129) there exists a
semicircular arch, shown by the dotted lines, which is constructed
horizontally, and could only have been copied from a radiating arch.(From Blouet’s ‘Voyage en
Grèce.’)]

Their city walls are chiefly remarkable for the size of the blocks of
stone used and for the beauty with which their irregular joints and
courses are fitted into one another.Like most fortifications, they are
generally devoid of ornament, the only architectural features being the
openings.These are interesting, as showing the steps by which a
peculiar form of masonry was perfected, and which, in after ages, led to
important architectural results.(From Texier’s ‘Asie Mineure.’)]

One of the most primitive of these buildings is a nameless ruin existing
near Missolonghi (Woodcut No.In it the sides of the opening are
straight for the whole height, and, though making a very stable form of
opening, it is one to which it is extremely difficult to fit doors, or
to close by any known means.It was this difficulty that led to the next
expedient adopted of inserting a lintel at a certain height, and making
the jambs more perpendicular below, and more sloping above.This method
is already exemplified in the tomb of Atreus (Woodcut No.124), and in
the Gate of the Lions at Mycenæ (Woodcut No.131); but it is by no means
clear whether the pediments were always filled up with sculpture, as in
this instance, or left open.In the walls of a town they were probably
always closed, but left open in a chamber.In the gate at Mycenæ the two
lions stand against an altar[128] shaped like a pillar, of a form found
only in Lycia, in which the round ends of the timbers of the roof are
shown as if projecting into the frieze.These are slight remains, it must be confessed, from which to
reconstruct an art which had so much influence on the civilisation of
Greece; but they are sufficient for the archæologist, as the existence
of a few fossil fragments of the bones of an elephant or a tortoise
suffice to prove the pre-existence of those animals wherever they have
been found, and enable the palæontologist to reason upon them with
almost as much certainty as if he saw them in a menagerie.Nor is it
difficult to see why the remnants are so few.When Homer describes the
imaginary dwelling of Alcinous—which he meant to be typical of a perfect
palace in his day—he does not speak of its construction or solidity, nor
tell us how symmetrically it was arranged; but he is lavish of his
praise of its brazen walls, its golden doors with their silver posts and
lintels—just as the writers of the Books of Kings and Chronicles praise
the contemporary temple or palace of Solomon for similar metallic
splendour.The palace of Menelaus is described by the same author as full of brass
and gold, silver and ivory.It was resplendent as the sun and moon, and
appeared to the eye of Telemachus like the mansion of Jupiter himself.On the architecture of the early Greek palaces considerable light has
been thrown through the researches of the late Dr.Schliemann at Tiryns,
on his second visit in 1884, when he was accompanied by Dr.Dörpfield,
who measured and drew out the plan which is here reproduced (Woodcut No.The palace at Tiryns is assumed by Dr.Schliemann to have been
destroyed by fire in the 11th century B.C.It was built in the upper
citadel and faced the south.The citadel was entered through a propylæum
with outer and inner portico, both in antis.A second propylæum of
smaller dimensions on the south of the entrance court gave access to the
chief court of the palace; this court was surrounded by porticoes on
three sides, and on the fourth or south side, a vestibule consisting of
a portico-in-antis leading to an ante-chamber, and the megaron or men’s
hall.The ante-chamber was separated from the portico by three
folding-doors, hung on solid timber framing; a single door, probably
closed by a curtain only, led from the ante-chamber to the men’s hall,
measuring 48 ft.by 33 ft., the roof of which was supported on four
pillars or columns; a circle in the centre of these indicated probably
the hearth.There are various chambers on the west side, one of which,
the bath-room, measuring 13 ft.by 10 ft., had a floor consisting of a
gigantic block of limestone 2 ft.On
the east side of the men’s hall was a second court with vestibule or
south side leading to the women’s hall (thalamos), 24 ft.by 17 ft., and
various other rooms on the west side of it.To the south of the women’s
court was a third court which may be considered to be the court of
service, with a passage leading direct to the entrance propylon of the
citadel.The walls were built in rubble masonry and clay mortar (clay mixed with
straw or hay); the foundations were carried from 6 ft.The walls were protected externally; first by a layer of
clay of various thicknesses and then with a plaster of lime about half
an inch thick.The upper portions of the walls generally consisted of
sun-dried bricks, and in order to give greater strength to the walls,
beams laid on thin slabs of stone (to give a horizontal bed) were built
into the outer surface.Blocks of hard limestone or breccia were used
for all the steps and door cills.The exposed angles of the walls and
the responds or antæ[129] of the columns were built of stone in the
lower part and wood above (in Troy they were always in wood with a stone
base).Opinions differ as to the lighting of the halls; the smaller
chambers were probably lighted through the door, as in Pompeii; but the
men’s and women’s halls must either have received their light through
openings at the side under the roof, or by a raised lantern over the
hearth before referred to.No temples are mentioned by Homer, nor by any early writer; but the
funereal rites celebrated in honour of Patroclus, as described in the
XXIII.Book of the Iliad, and the mounds still existing on the Plains of
Troy, testify to the character of the people whose manners and customs
he was describing, and would alone be sufficient to convince us that,
except in their tombs, we should find little to commemorate their
previous existence.The subject is interesting, and deserves far more attention than has
hitherto been bestowed upon it, and more space than can be devoted to it
here.Not only is this art the art of people who warred before Troy, but
our knowledge of it reveals to us a secret which otherwise might for
ever have remained a mystery.The religion of the Homeric poems is
essentially Anthropic and Ancestral—in other words, of Turanian origin,
with hardly a trace of Aryan feeling running through it.When we know
that the same was the case with the arts of those days, we feel that it
could not well be otherwise; but what most excites our wonder is the
power of the poet, whose song, describing the manners and feelings of an
extinct race, was so beautiful as to cause its adoption as a gospel by a
people of another race, tincturing their religion to the latest hour of
their existence.We have very little means of knowing how long this style of art lasted
in Greece.The treasury built by Myron king of Sicyon at Olympia about
650 B.C.seems to have been of this style, in so far as we can judge of
it by the description of Pausanias.[130] It consisted of two chambers,
one ornamented in the Doric, one in the Ionic style, not apparently with
pillars, but with that kind of decoration which appears at that period
to have been recognised as peculiar to each.But the entire decorations
seem to have been of brass, the weight of metal employed being recorded
in an inscription on the building.The earliest example of a Doric
temple that we know of—that of Corinth—would appear to belong to very
nearly the same age, so that the 7th century B.C.may probably be taken
as the period when the old Turanian form of Pelasgic art gave way before
the sterner and more perfect creations of a purer Hellenic design.Perhaps it might be more correct to say that the Hellenic history of
Greece commenced with the Olympiads (B.C.776), but before that kingdom
bloomed into perfection an older civilisation had passed away, leaving
little beyond a few tombs and works of public utility as records of its
prior existence.It left, however, an undying influence which can be
traced through every subsequent stage of Grecian history, which gave
form to that wonderful artistic development of art, the principal if not
the only cause of the unrivalled degree of perfection to which it
subsequently attained.B. Temple of Niké Apteros.E. Foundations of old Temple of Athena, sixth century B.C.
]The culminating period of the Pelasgic civilisation of Greece was at the
time of the war with Troy—the last great military event of that age, and
the one which seems to have closed the long and intimate connection of
the Greek Pelasgians with their cognate races in Asia.Sixty years later the irruption of the Thessalians, and twenty years
after that event the return of the Heracleidæ, closed, in a political
sense, that chapter in history, and gave rise to what may be styled the
Hellenic civilisation, which proved the great and true glory of Greece.Four centuries, however, elapsed, which may appropriately be called the
dark ages of Greece, before the new seed bore fruit, at least in so far
as art is concerned.These ages produced, it is true, the laws of
Lycurgus, a characteristic effort of a truly Aryan race, conferring as
they did on the people who made them that power of self-government, and
capacity for republican institutions, which gave them such stability at
home and so much power abroad, but which were as inimical to the softer
glories of the fine arts in Sparta as they have proved elsewhere.When, after this long night, architectural art reappeared, it was at
Corinth, under the Cypselidæ, a race of strongly-marked Asiatic
tendencies; but it had in the meantime undergone so great a
transformation as to well-nigh bewilder us.On its reappearance it was
no longer characterised by the elegant and ornate art of Mycenæ and the
cognate forms of Asiatic growth, but had assumed the rude, bold
proportions of Egyptian art, and with almost more than Egyptian
massiveness.DORIC TEMPLES IN GREECE.The age of the Doric temple at Corinth is not, it is true,
satisfactorily determined; but the balance of evidence would lead us to
believe that it belongs to the age of Cypselus, or about 650 B.C.The
pillars are less than four diameters in height, and the architrave—the
only part of the superstructure that now remains—is proportionately
heavy.It is, indeed, one of the most massive specimens of architecture
existing, more so than even the rock-cut prototype at Beni Hasan.As a
work of art, it fails from excess of strength, a fault common to most of
the efforts of a rude people, ignorant of the true resources of art, and
striving, by the expression of physical power alone, to attain its
objects.Next in age to this is the little temple at Ægina.[131] Its date, too,
is unknown, though, judging from the character of its sculpture, it
probably belongs to the middle of the sixth century before Christ.We know that Athens had a great temple on the Acropolis, contemporary
with these, and the frusta of its columns still remain, which, after its
destruction by the Persians, were built into the walls of the citadel.It is more than probable that all the principal cities of Greece had
temples commensurate with their dignity before the Persian War.Many of
these were destroyed during that struggle; but it also happened then, as
in France and England in the 12th and 13th centuries, that the old
temples were thought unworthy of the national greatness, and of that
feeling of exaltation arising from the successful result of the greatest
of their wars, so that almost all those which remained were pulled down
or rebuilt.The consequence is, that nearly all the great temples now
found in Greece were built in the forty or fifty years which succeeded
the defeat of the Persians at Salamis and Platæa.One of the oldest temples of this class is that best known as the
Theseion or Temple of Theseus at Athens, now recognised as the Temple of
Hephaistos mentioned in the “Attica” of Pausanias.By an analysis of the
architectural character of the Temple Dr.Dorpfield contends that it is
posterior to the Parthenon and not anterior, as is generally supposed.Of all the great temples, the best and most celebrated is the Parthenon,
the only octastyle Doric Temple in Greece, and in its own class
undoubtedly the most beautiful building in the world.It is true it has
neither the dimensions nor the wondrous expression of power and eternity
inherent in Egyptian temples, nor has it the variety and poetry of the
Gothic Cathedral; but for intellectual beauty, for perfection of
proportion, for beauty of detail, and for the exquisite perception of
the highest and most recondite principles of art ever applied to
architecture, it stands utterly and entirely alone and unrivalled—the
glory of Greece and a reproach to the rest of the world.Next in size and in beauty to this was the great hexastyle temple of
Jupiter at Olympia, finished two years later than the Parthenon.Its
dimensions were nearly the same, but having only six pillars in front
instead of eight, as in the Parthenon, the proportions were different,
this temple being 95 ft.by 230, the Parthenon 101 ft.The excavations at Olympia, undertaken at the cost of the German
Government in 1876, not only laid bare the site of the Temple of
Jupiter, of which the lower frusta of half the column, the lower
portions of the walls of cella and nearly the whole of the pavement was
found in situ; but led to the recovery of a great portion of the
sculptures which decorated the metopes and filled the pediments, so that
it is not only possible to restore the complete design of the temple
itself but to obtain a distinct idea of its sculptural decoration.The
foundations of other Doric temples were found; of the Temple of Hera,
which seems originally to have been a wooden structure, the wood being
gradually replaced by stone when from its decay it required
renewal.[132] This temple was coeval if not more ancient than that of
Zeus; the interior of the cella would seem to have been subdivided into
bays or niches inside, similar to those of the Temple at Bassæ; a third
hexastyle Doric temple, the Metroum, was also discovered, and many
buildings dating from the Roman occupation.To the same age belongs the exquisite little Temple of Apollo Epicurius
at Bassæ (47 ft.by 125), the Temple of Minerva at Sunium, the greater
temple at Rhamnus, the Propylæa at Athens, and indeed all that is
greatest and most beautiful in the architecture of Greece.The temple of
Ceres at Eleusis also was founded and designed at this period, but its
execution belongs to a later date.The temple at Assos, though not of any great size, is interesting on
account of its having had the outer face of the architrave sculptured in
relief, requiring therefore an architectural frame which was obtained by
leaving a raised fillet along the bottom.The temple was
hexastyle-peristyle with pronaos but no posticum.The date is assumed to
be about 470 B.C., or shortly after the battle of Mycale.[133]


                        DORIC TEMPLES IN SICILY.Owing probably to some local peculiarity, which we have not now the
means of explaining, the Dorian colonies of Sicily and Magna Græcia seem
to have possessed, in the days of their prosperity, a greater number of
temples, and certainly retain the traces of many more, than were or are
to be found in any of the great cities of the mother country.The one
city of Selinus alone possesses six, in two groups,—three in the citadel
and three in the city.Of these the oldest is the central one of the
first-named group.Angell
and Harris, indicate an age only slightly subsequent to the foundation
of the colony, B.C.636, and therefore probably nearly contemporary with
the example above mentioned at Corinth.The most modern is the great
octastyle temple, which seems to have been left unfinished at the time
of the destruction of the city by the Carthaginians, B.C.by 166, and was consequently very much larger than any
temple of its class in Greece.The remaining four range between these
dates, and therefore form a tolerably perfect chronometric series at
that time when the arts of Greece itself fail us.The inferiority,
however, of provincial art, as compared with that of Greece itself,
prevents us from applying such a test with too much confidence to the
real history of the art, though it is undoubtedly valuable as a
secondary illustration.At Agrigentum there are three Doric temples, two small hexastyles, whose
age may be about 500 to 480 B.C., and one great exceptional example,
differing in its arrangements from all the Grecian temples of the age.long by 173 broad, and consequently very
nearly the same as those of the great Temple of Selinus just alluded to.Its date is perfectly known, as it was commenced by Theron, B.C.480,
and left unfinished seventy-five years afterwards, when the city was
destroyed by the Carthaginians.At Syracuse there still exist the ruins of a very beautiful temple of
this age; and at Segesta are remains of another in a much more perfect
state.Pæstum, in Magna Græcia, boasts of the most magnificent group of temples
after that at Agrigentum.One is a very beautiful hexastyle, belonging
probably to the middle of the fifth century B.C., built in a bold and
very pure style of Doric architecture, and still retains the greater
part of its internal columnar arrangement.The other two are more modern, and are far less pure both in plan and in
detail, one having nine columns at each end, the central pillars of
which are meant to correspond with an internal range of pillars,
supporting the ridge of the roof.The other, though of a regular form,
is so modified by local peculiarities, so corrupt, in fact, as hardly to
deserve being ranked with the beautiful order which it most resembles.We have even fewer materials for the history of the Ionic order in
Greece than we have for that of the Doric.The recent discoveries in
Assyria have proved beyond a doubt that the Ionic was even more
essentially an introduction from Asia[134] than the Doric was from
Egypt: the only question is, when it was brought into Greece.My own
impression is, that it existed there in one form or another from the
earliest ages, but owing to its slenderer proportions, and the greater
quantity of wood used in its construction, the examples may have
perished, so that nothing is now known to exist which can lay claim to
even so great an antiquity as the Persian War.The oldest example, probably, was the temple on the Ilissus, now
destroyed, dating from about 484 B.C.; next to this is the little gem of
a temple dedicated to Niké Apteros, or the Wingless Victory, built about
fifteen years later, in front of the Propylæa at Athens.The last and
most perfect of all the examples of this order is the Erechtheium, on
the Acropolis; its date is apparently about 420 B.C., the great epoch of
Athenian art.Nowhere did the exquisite taste and skill of the Athenians
show themselves to greater advantage than here; for though every detail
of the order may be traced back to Nineveh or Persepolis, all are so
purified, so imbued with purely Grecian taste and feeling, that they
have become essential parts of a far more beautiful order than ever
existed in the land in which they had their origin.The largest, and perhaps the finest, of Grecian Ionic temples was that
built about a century afterwards at Tegea, in Arcadia—a regular
peripteral temple of considerable dimensions, but the existence of which
is now known only from the description of Pausanias.[135]

As in the case, however, of the Doric order, it is not in Greece itself
that we find either the greatest number of Ionic temples or those most
remarkable for size, but in the colonies in Asia Minor, and more
especially in Ionia, whence the order most properly takes its name.That an Ionic order existed in Asia Minor before the Persian War is
quite certain, but all examples perished in that memorable struggle; and
when it subsequently reappeared, the order had lost much of its purely
Asiatic character, and assumed certain forms and tendencies borrowed
from the simpler and purer Doric style.If any temple in the Asiatic Greek colonies escaped destruction in the
Persian wars, it was that of Juno at Samos.It is said to have been
built by Polycrates, and appears to have been of the Doric order.The
ruins now found there are of the Ionic order, 346 ft.by 190 ft., and
must have succeeded the first mentioned.The apparent archaisms in the
form of the bases, &c., which have misled antiquarians, are merely
Eastern forms retained in spite of Grecian influence.More remarkable even than this was the celebrated Temple of Diana at
Ephesus, said by Pliny to have been 425 ft.Recent
excavations on the site, however, carried out by Mr.T. Wood, prove that
these dimensions apply only to the platform on which it stood.The
temple itself, measured from the outside of the angle pillars, was only
348 ft.by 164, making the area 57,072 ft., or about the average
dimensions of our mediæval cathedrals.Besides these, there was a splendid decastyle temple, dedicated to
Apollo Didymæus, at Miletus, 156 ft.in length; an
octastyle at Sardis, 261 ft.; an exquisitely beautiful,
though small hexastyle, at Priene, 122 ft.; and another at
Teos, and smaller examples elsewhere, besides many others which have no
doubt perished.German explorations in Pergamon have brought to light the remains of the
Augustæum, a building consisting of two detached wings with columns of
the Ionic order resting on a lofty podium enriched with sculpture and
connected one with the other by a magnificent flight of steps, the whole
block measuring 125 ft.[136]


                          CORINTHIAN TEMPLES.The Corinthian order is as essentially borrowed from the bell-shaped
capitals of Egypt as the Doric is from their oldest pillars.Like
everything they touched, the Greeks soon rendered it their own by the
freedom and elegance with which they treated it.The acanthus-leaf with
which they adorned it is essentially Grecian, and we must suppose that
it had been used by them as an ornament, either in their metal or wood
work, long before they adopted it in stone as an architectural feature.As in everything else, however, the Greeks could not help betraying in
this also the Asiatic origin of their art, and the Egyptian order with
them was soon wedded to the Ionic, whose volutes became an essential
though subdued part of this order.It is in fact a composite order, made
up of the bell-shaped capitals of the Egyptians and the spiral of the
Assyrians, and adopted by the Greeks at a time when national
distinctions were rapidly disappearing, and when true and severer art
was giving place to love of variety.At that time also mere ornament and
carving were supplanting the purer class of forms and the higher
aspirations of sculpture with which the Greeks ornamented their temples
in their best days.In Greece the order does not appear to have been introduced, or at least
generally used, before the age of Alexander the Great; the oldest
authentic example, and also one of the most beautiful, being the
Choragic Monument of Lysicrates (B.C.335), which, notwithstanding the
smallness of its dimensions, is one of the most beautiful works of art
of the merely ornamental class to be found in any part of the world.A
simpler example, but by no means so beautiful, is that of the porticoes
of the small octagonal building commonly called the Tower of the Winds
at Athens.The largest example in Greece of the Corinthian order is the
Temple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens.This, however, may almost be
called a Roman building, though on Grecian soil—having been commenced in
its present form under Antiochus Epiphanes, in the second century B.C.by the Roman architect Cossutius, and only finished by Hadrian, to whom
probably we may ascribe the greatest part of what now remains.by 354 ft., and from the number of its columns,
their size and their beauty, it must have been when complete the most
beautiful Corinthian temple of the ancient world.Judging, however, from some fragments found among the Ionic temples of
Asia Minor, it appears that the Corinthian order was introduced there
before we find any trace of it in Greece Proper.Indeed, _à priori_, we
might expect that its introduction into Greece was part of that reaction
which the elegant and luxurious Asiatics exercised on the severer and
more manly inhabitants of European Greece, and which was in fact the
main cause of their subjection, first to the Macedonians, and finally
beneath the iron yoke of Rome.As used by the Asiatics, it seems to have
arisen from the introduction of the bell-shaped capital of the
Egyptians, to which they applied the acanthus-leaf, sometimes in
conjunction with the honeysuckle ornament of the time, as in Woodcut No.135, and on other and later occasions together with the volutes of the
same order, the latter combination being the one which ultimately
prevailed and became the typical form of the Corinthian capital.DIMENSIONS OF GREEK TEMPLES.Although differing so essentially in plan, the general dimensions of the
larger temples of the Greeks were very similar to those of the mediæval
cathedrals, and although they never reached the altitude of their modern
rivals, their cubic dimensions were probably in about the same ratio of
proportion.The following table gives the approximate dimensions, rejecting
fractions, of the eight largest and best known examples:—

   Juno, at Samos         346 feet long 190 feet wide = 65,740 feet.Jupiter, at Agrigentum 360 feet long 173 feet wide = 62,280 feet.Apollo, at Branchidæ   362 feet long 168 feet wide = 60,816 feet.Diana, at Ephesus      348 feet long 164 feet wide = 57,072 feet.Jupiter, at Athens     354 feet long 135 feet wide = 47,790 feet.Didymæus, at Miletus   295 feet long 156 feet wide = 45,020 feet.Cybele, at Sardis      261 feet long 144 feet wide = 37,884 feet.Parthenon, at Athens   228 feet long 101 feet wide = 23,028 feet.There may be some slight discrepancies in this table from the figures
quoted elsewhere, and incorrectness arising from some of the temples
being measured on the lowest step and others, as the Parthenon, on the
highest; but it is sufficient for comparison, which is all that is
attempted in its compilation.The Doric was the order which the Greeks especially loved and cultivated
so as to make it most exclusively their own; and, as used in the
Parthenon, it certainly is as complete and as perfect an architectural
feature as any style can boast of.When first introduced from Egypt, it,
as before stated, partook of even more than Egyptian solidity, but by
degrees became attenuated to the weak and lean form of the Roman order
of the same name.136, 137, 138 illustrate the three stages
of progress from the oldest example at Corinth to the order as used in
the time of Philip at Delos, the intermediate being the culminating
point in the age of Pericles: the first is 4·47 diameters in height, the
next 6·025, the last 7·015; and if the table were filled up with all the
other examples, the gradual attenuation of the shaft would very nearly
give the relative date of the example.This fact is in itself sufficient
to refute the idea of the pillar being copied from a wooden post, as in
that case it would have been slenderer at first, and would gradually
have departed from the wooden form as the style advanced.[137] This is
the case in all carpentry styles.With the Doric order the contrary
takes place.The earlier the example the more unlike it is to any wooden
original.As the masons advanced in skill and power over their stone
material, it came more and more to resemble posts or pillars of wood.The fact appears to be that, either in Egypt or in early Greece, the
pillar was originally a pier of brickwork, or of rubble masonry,
supporting a wooden roof, of which the architraves, the triglyphs, and
the various parts of the cornice, all bore traces down to the latest
period.Even as ordinarily represented, or as copied in this country, there is a
degree of solidity combined with elegance in this order, and an
exquisite proportion of the parts to one another and to the work they
have to perform, that command the admiration of every person of taste;
but, as used in Greece, its beauty was very much enhanced by a number of
refinements whose existence was not suspected till lately, and even now
cannot be detected but by the most practised eye.The columns were at first assumed to be bounded by straight lines.It is
now found that they have an _entasis_, or convex profile, in the
Parthenon to the extent of 1/550 of the whole height, and are outlined
by a very delicate hyperbolic curve; it is true this can hardly be
detected by the eye in ordinary positions, but the want of it gives that
rigidity and poverty to the column which is observable in modern
examples.[138]

In like manner, the architrave in all temples was carried upwards so as
to form a very flat arch, just sufficient to correct the optical
delusion arising from the interference of the sloping lines of the
pediment.This, I believe, was common to all temples, but in the
Parthenon the curve was applied to the sides also, though from what
motive it is not so easy to detect.Another refinement was making all the columns <DW72> slightly inwards, so
as to give an idea of strength and support to the whole.Add to this,
that all the curved lines used were either hyperbolas or parabolas.With
one exception only, no circular line was employed, nor even an ellipse.Every part of the temple was also arranged with the most unbounded care
and accuracy, and every detail of the masonry was carried out with a
precision and beauty of execution which is almost unrivalled, and it may
be added that the material of the whole was the purest and best white
marble.All these delicate adjustments, this exquisite finish and
attention to even the smallest details, are well bestowed on a design in
itself simple, beautiful, and appropriate.They combine to render this
order, as found in the best Greek temples, as nearly faultless as any
work of art can possibly be, and such as we may dwell upon with the most
unmixed and unvarying satisfaction.The system of definite proportion which the Greeks employed in the
design of their temples, was another cause of the effect they produce
even on uneducated minds.It was not with them merely that the height
was equal to the width, or the length about twice the breadth; but every
part was proportioned to all those parts with which it was related, in
some such ratio as 1 to 6, 2 to 7, 3 to 8, 4 to 9, or 5 to 10, &c. As
the scheme advances these numbers become undesirably high.In this case
they reverted to some such simple ratios as 4 to 5, 5 to 6, 6 to 7, and
so on.We do not yet quite understand the process of reasoning by which the
Greeks arrived at the laws which guided their practice in this respect;
but they evidently attached the utmost importance to it, and when the
ratio was determined upon, they set it out with such accuracy, that even
now the calculated and the measured dimensions seldom vary beyond such
minute fractions as can only be expressed in hundredths of an inch.Though the existence of such a system of ratios has long been suspected,
it is only recently that any measurements of Greek temples have been
made with sufficient accuracy to enable the matter to be properly
investigated and their existence proved.[139]

The ratios are in some instances so recondite, and the correlation of
the parts at first sight so apparently remote, that many would be
inclined to believe they were more fanciful than real.[140] It would,
however, be as reasonable in a person with no ear, or no musical
education, to object to the enjoyment of a complicated concerted piece
of music experienced by those differently situated, or to declare that
the pain musicians feel from a false note was mere affectation.The eyes
of the Greeks were as perfectly educated as our ears.They could
appreciate harmonies which are lost in us, and were offended at false
quantities which our duller senses fail to perceive.But in spite of
ourselves, we do feel the beauty of these harmonic relations, though we
hardly know why; and if educated to them, we might acquire what might
almost be considered a new sense.But be this as it may, there can be no
doubt but that a great deal of the beauty which all feel in
contemplating the architectural productions of the Greeks, arises from
causes such as these, which we are only now beginning to appreciate.To understand, however, the Doric order, we must not regard it as a
merely masonic form.Sculpture was always used, or intended to be used,
with it.The Metopes between the triglyphs, the pediments of the
porticoes, and the acroteria or pedestals on the roof, are all unmeaning
and useless unless filled or surmounted with sculptured figures.Sculpture is, indeed, as essential a part of this order as the
acanthus-leaves and ornaments of the cornice are to the capitals and
entablature of the Corinthian order; and without it, or without its
place being supplied by painting, we are merely looking at the dead
skeleton, the mere framework of the order, without the flesh and blood
that gave it life and purpose.It is when all these parts are combined together, as in the portico of
the Parthenon (Woodcut No.139), that we can understand this order in
all its perfection; for though each part was beautiful in itself, their
full value can be appreciated only as parts of a great whole.Another essential part of the order, too often overlooked, is the
colour, which was as integral a part of it as its form.Till very
lately, it was denied that Greek temples were, or could be, painted: the
unmistakable remains of colour, however, that have been discovered in
almost all temples, and the greater knowledge of the value and use of it
which now prevails, have altered public opinion very much on the matter,
and most people now admit that some colour was used, though few are
agreed as to the extent to which it was carried.It cannot now be questioned that colour was used everywhere internally,
and on every object.Externally too it is generally admitted that the
sculpture was painted and relieved by strongly <DW52> backgrounds; the
lacunaria, or recesses of the roof, were also certainly painted; and all
the architectural mouldings, which at a later period were carved in
relief, have been found to retain traces of their painted ornaments.It is disputed whether the echinus or carved moulding of the capital was
so ornamented.There seems little doubt but that it was; and that the
walls of the cells were also  throughout and covered with
paintings illustrative of the legends and attributes of the divinity to
whom the temple was dedicated or of the purposes for which it was
erected.The plane face of the architrave was probably left white, or
merely ornamented with metal shields or inscriptions, and the shafts of
the columns appear also to have been left plain, or merely slightly
stained to tone down the crudeness of the white marble.Generally
speaking, all those parts which from their form or position were in any
degree protected from the rain or atmospheric influences seem to have
been ; those particularly exposed, to have been left plain.To
whatever extent, however, painting may have been carried, these 
ornaments were as essential a part of the Doric order as the carved
ornaments were of the Corinthian, and made it, when perfect, a richer
and more ornamental, as it was a more solid and stable, order than the
latter.The colour nowhere interfered with the beauty of its forms, but
gave it that richness and amount of ornamentation which is indispensable
in all except the most colossal buildings, and a most valuable adjunct
even to them.The Ionic order, as we now find it, is not without some decided
advantages over the Doric.It is more complete in itself and less
dependent on sculpture.Its frieze was too small for much display of
human life and action, and was probably usually ornamented with lines of
animals,[141] like the friezes at Persepolis.But the frieze of the
little temple of Nikè Apteros is brilliantly ornamented in the same
style as those of the Doric order.It also happened that those details
and ornaments which were only painted in the Doric, were carved in the
Ionic order, and remain therefore visible to the present day, which
gives to this order a completeness in our eyes which the other cannot
boast of.Add to this a certain degree of Asiatic elegance and grace,
and the whole when put together makes up a singularly pleasing
architectural object.But notwithstanding these advantages, the Doric
order will probably always be admitted to be superior, as belonging to a
higher class of art, and because all its forms and details are better
and more adapted to their purpose than those of the Ionic.Ionic order of Erechtheium at Athens.]The principal characteristic of the Ionic order is the Pelasgic or
Asiatic spiral, here called a volute, which, notwithstanding its
elegance, forms at best but an awkward capital.The Assyrian honeysuckle
below this, carved as it is with the exquisite feeling and taste which a
Greek alone knew how to impart to such an object, forms as elegant an
architectural detail as is anywhere to be found; and whether used as the
necking of a column, or on the crowning member of a cornice, or on other
parts of the order, is everywhere the most beautiful ornament connected
with it.Comparing this order with that at Persepolis (Woodcut No.96),
the only truly Asiatic prototype we have of it, we see how much the
Doric feeling of the Greeks had done to sober it down, by abbreviating
the capital and omitting the greater part of the base.This process was
carried much farther when the order was used in conjunction with the
Doric, as in the Propylæa, than when used by itself, as in the
Erechtheium; still in every case all the parts found in the Asiatic
style are found in the Greek.The same form and feelings pervade both;
and, except in beauty of execution and detail, it is not quite clear how
far even the Greek order is an improvement on the Eastern one.The
Persepolitan base is certainly the more beautiful of the two; so are
many parts of the capital.The perfection of the whole, however, depends
on the mode in which it is employed; and it is perfectly evident that
the Persian order could not be combined with the Doric, nor applied with
much propriety as an external order, which was the essential use of all
the Grecian forms of pillars.Ionic order in Temple of Apollo at Bassæ.]Section of half of the Ionic Capital at Bassæ, taken
through the volute.]When used between antæ or square piers, as seems usually to have been
the case in Assyria, the two-fronted form of the Ionic capital was
appropriate and elegant; but when it was employed, as in the
Erechtheium, as an angle column, it presented a difficulty which even
Grecian skill and ingenuity could not quite conquer.When the Persians
wanted the capital to face four ways they turned the side outwards, as
at Persepolis (Woodcut No.96), and put the volutes in the angles—which
was at best but an awkward mode of getting over the difficulty.The instance in which these difficulties have been most successfully met
is in the internal order at Bassæ.There the three sides are equal, and
are equally seen—the fourth is attached to the wall—and the junction of
the faces is formed with an elegance that has never been surpassed.It
has not the richness of the order of the Erechtheium, but it excels it
in elegance.Its widely spreading base still retains traces of the
wooden origin of the order, and carries us back towards the times when a
shoe was necessary to support wooden posts on the floor of an Assyrian
hall.Notwithstanding the amount of carving which the Ionic order displays,
there can be little doubt of its having been also ornamented with colour
to a considerable extent, but probably in a different manner from the
Doric.My own impression is, that the carved parts were gilt, or picked
out with gold, relieved by  grounds, varied according to the
situation in which they were found.The existing remains prove that
colours were used in juxtaposition, to relieve and heighten the
architectural effect of the carved ornaments of this order.In the Ionic temples at Athens the same exquisite masonry was used as in
the Doric; the same mathematical precision and care is bestowed on the
entasis of the columns, the drawing of the volutes, and the execution of
even the minutest details; and much of its beauty and effect are no
doubt owing to this circumstance, which we miss so painfully in nearly
all modern examples.As before mentioned, the Corinthian order was only introduced into
Greece on the decline of art, and never rose during the purely Grecian
age to the dignity of a temple order.It most probably, however, was
used in the more ornate specimens of domestic architecture, and in
smaller works of art, long before any of those examples of it were
executed which we now find in Greece.Order of the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates.]The most typical specimen we now know is that of the Choragic Monument
of Lysicrates (Woodcut No.143), which, notwithstanding all its elegance
of detail and execution, can hardly be pronounced to be perfect, the
Egyptian and Asiatic features being only very indifferently united to
one another.The foliaged part is rich and full, but is not carried up
into the upper or Ionic portion, which is, in comparison, lean and poor;
and though separately the two parts are irreproachable, it was left to
the Romans so to blend the two together as to make a perfectly
satisfactory whole out of them.In this example, as now existing, the junction of the column with the
capital is left a plain sinking, and so it is generally copied in modern
times; but there can be little doubt that this was originally filled by
a bronze wreath, which was probably gilt.Accordingly this is so
represented in the woodcut as being essential to the completion of the
order.The base and shaft have, like the upper part of the capital, more
Ionic feeling in them than the order was afterwards allowed to retain;
and altogether it is, as here practised, far more elegant, though less
complete, than the Roman form which superseded it.Order of the Tower of the Winds, Athens.]The other Athenian example, that of the Tower of the winds (Woodcut No.144), is remarkable as being almost purely Egyptian in its types, with
no Ionic admixture.The columns have no bases, the capitals no volutes,
and the water-leaf clings as closely to the bell as it does in the
Egyptian examples.The result altogether wants richness, and, though
appropriate on so small a scale, would hardly be pleasing on a larger.The great example of the Temple of Jupiter Olympius differs in no
essential part from the Roman order, except that the corners of the
abacus are not cut off; and that, being executed in Athens, there is a
degree of taste and art displayed in its execution which we do not find
in any Roman examples.Strictly speaking, however, it belongs to that
school, and should be enumerated as a Roman, and not as a Grecian,
example.Caryatide Figure in the British Museum.]It has been already explained that the Egyptians never used caryatide
figures, properly so called, to support the entablatures of their
architecture, their figures being always attached to the front of the
columns or piers, which were the real bearing mass.At Persepolis, and
elsewhere in the East, we find figures everywhere employed supporting
the throne or the platform of the palaces of the kings; not, indeed, on
their heads, as the Greeks used them, but rather in their uplifted
hands.The name, however, as well as their being only used in conjunction with
the Ionic order and with Ionic details, all point to an Asiatic origin
for this very questionable form of art.As employed in the little
Portico attached to the Erechtheium, these figures are used with so much
taste, and all the ornaments are so elegant, that it is difficult to
criticise or find fault; but it is nevertheless certain that it was a
mistake which even the art of the Greeks could hardly conceal.To use
human figures to support a cornice is unpardonable, unless it is done as
a mere secondary adjunct to a building.In the Erechtheium it is a
little too prominent for this, though used with as much discretion as
was perhaps possible under the circumstances.Another example of the
sort is shown in Woodcut No.146, which, by employing a taller cap,
avoids some of the objections to the other; but the figure itself, on
the other hand, is less architectural, and so errs on the other side.Caryatide Figure from the Erechtheium.]Another form of this class of support is that of the Giants or
_Telamones_, instances of which are found supporting the roof of the
great Temple at Agrigentum, and in the baths of the semi-Greek city of
Pompeii.As they do not actually bear the entablature, but only seem to
relieve the masonry behind them, their employment is less objectionable
than that of the female figures above described; but even they hardly
fulfil the conditions of true art, and their place might be better
filled by some more strictly architectural feature.The arrangements of Grecian Doric temples show almost less variety than
the forms of the pillars, and no materials exist for tracing their
gradual development in an historical point of view.The temples at
Corinth, and the oldest at Selinus, are both perfect examples of the
hexastyle arrangement to which the Greeks adhered in all ages; and
though there can be little doubt that the peripteral form, as well as
the order itself, was borrowed from Egypt, it still was so much modified
before it appeared in Greece, that it would be interesting, if it could
be done, to trace the several steps by which the change was effected.In an architectural point of view this is by no means difficult.The
simplest Greek temples were mere cells, or small square apartments
suited to contain an image—the front being what is technically called
_distyle in antis_, or with two pillars between _antæ_, or square
pilaster like piers terminating the side walls.Hence the interior
enclosure of Grecian temples is called the cell or cella, however large
and splendid it may be.The next change was to separate the interior into a cell and porch by a
wall with a large doorway in it, as in the small temple at Rhamnus
(Woodcut No.148), where the opening however can scarcely be called a
doorway, as it extends to the roof.A third change was to put a porch of
4 pillars in front of the last arrangement, or, as appears to have been
more usual, to bring forward the screen to the positions of the pillars
as in the last example, and to place the 4 pillars in front of this.None of these plans admitted of a peristyle, or pillars on the flanks.To obtain this it was necessary to increase the number of pillars of the
portico to 6, or, as it is termed, to make it hexastyle, the 2 outer
pillars being the first of a range of 13 or 15 columns, extended along
each side of the temple.The cell in this arrangement was a complete
temple in itself—distyle in antis, most frequently made so at both ends,
and the whole enclosed in its envelope of columns, as in Woodcut No.Sometimes the cell was tetrastyle or with four pillars in front.(From Hittorff,
‘Arch.Antique en Sicile.’) Scale 100 ft.In this form the Greek temple may be said to be complete, very few
exceptions occurring to the rule, though the Parthenon itself is one of
these few.It has an inner hexastyle portico at each end of the cell;
beyond these outwardly are octastyle porticoes, with 17 columns on each
flank.The great Temple at Selinus is also octastyle, but it is neither so
simple nor so beautiful in its arrangement; and, from the decline of
style in the art when it was built, is altogether an inferior example;
still, as one of the largest of Greek Doric temples, its plan is worthy
of being quoted as an illustration of the varying forms of these
temples.Another great exception is the great temple at Agrigentum (Woodcuts Nos.152 and 154), where the architect attempted an order on so gigantic a
scale that he was unable to construct the pillars with their architraves
standing free.The interstices of the columns are therefore built up
with walls pierced with windows, and altogether the architecture is so
bad, that even its colossal dimensions must have failed to render it at
any time a pleasing or satisfactory work of art.A fourth exception is the double temple at Pæstum, with 9 pillars in
front, a clumsy expedient, but which arose from its having a range of
columns down the centre to support the ridge of the roof by a simpler
mode than the triangular truss usually employed for carrying the roof
between two ranges of column.Plan of Great Temple at Agrigentum.With the exception of the temple at Agrigentum, all these were
peristylar, or had ranges of columns all around them, enclosing the cell
as it were in a case, an arrangement so apparently devoid of purpose,
that it is not at first sight easy to account for its universality.It
will not suffice to say that it was adopted merely because it was
beautiful, for the forms of Egyptian temples, which had no pillars
externally, were as perfect, and in the hands of the Greeks would have
become as beautiful, as the one they adopted.Besides, it is natural to
suppose they would rather have copied the larger than the smaller
temples, if no motive existed for their preference of the latter.The
peristyle, too, was ill suited for an ambulatory, or place for
processions to circulate round the temple; it was too narrow for this,
and too high to protect the procession from the rain.Indeed, I know of
no suggestion except that it may have been adopted to protect the
paintings on the walls of the cells from the inclemency of the weather.It hardly admits of a doubt that the walls were painted, and that
without protection of some sort this would very soon have been
obliterated.It seems also very evident that the peristyle was not only
practically, but artistically, most admirably adapted for this purpose.The paintings of the Greeks were, like those of the Egyptians, composed
of numerous detached groups, connected only by the story, and it almost
required the intervention of pillars, or some means of dividing into
compartments the surface to be so painted, to separate these groups from
one another, and to prevent the whole sequence from being seen at once;
while, on the other hand, nothing can have been more beautiful than the
white marble columns relieved against a richly  plane surface.The one appears so necessary to the other, that it seems hardly to be
doubted that this was the cause, or that the effect must have been most
surpassingly beautiful.MODE OF LIGHTING TEMPLES.The arrangement of the interior of Grecian temples necessarily depended
on the mode in which they were lighted.No one will, I believe, now
contend, as was once done, that it was by lamplight alone that the
beauty of their interiors could be seen; and as light certainly was not
introduced through the side walls, nor could be in sufficient quantities
through the doorways, it is only from the roof that it could be
admitted.At the same time it could not have been by a large horizontal
opening in the roof, as has been supposed, as that would have admitted
the rain and snow as well as the light; and the only alternative seems
to be one I suggested some years ago—of a clerestory,[142] similar
internally to that found in all the great Egyptian temples,[143] but
externally requiring such a change of arrangement as was necessary to
adapt it to a sloping instead of a flat roof.This could have been
effected by countersinking it into the roof, so as to make it in fact 3
ridges in those parts where the light was admitted, though the regular
<DW72> of the roof was retained between these openings, so that neither
the ridge nor the continuity of the lines of the roof was interfered
with.This would effect all that was required, and in the most beautiful
manner; it moreover agrees with all the remains of Greek temples that
now exist, as well as with all the descriptions that have been handed
down to us from antiquity.to 1 in]

[Illustration: 154.Part Section, part Elevation, of Great Temple at
Agrigentum.This arrangement will be understood from the section of the Parthenon
(Woodcut No.153), restored in accordance with the above explanation,
which agrees perfectly with all that remains on the spot, as well as
with all the accounts we have of that celebrated temple.The same system
applies even more easily to the great hexastyle at Pæstum and to the
beautiful little Temple of Apollo at Bassæ, in Phigaleia (Woodcut No.149), and in fact to all regular Greek temples.Indeed, it seems
impossible to account for the peculiarities of that temple except on
some such theory as this.Any one who studies the plan (Woodcut No.149)
will see at once what pains were taken to bring the internal columns
exactly into the spaces between those of the external peristyle.The
effect inside is clumsy, and never would have been attempted were it not
that practically their position was seen from the outside, and this
could hardly have been so on any other hypothesis than that now
proposed.An equally important point in the examination of this theory
is that it applies equally to the exceptional ones.The side aisles, for
instance, of the great temple at Agrigentum were, as before mentioned,
lighted by side windows; the central one could only be lighted from the
roof, and it is easy to see how this could be effected by introducing
openings between the telamones, as shown in Woodcut No.In the great Temple of Jupiter Olympius (Woodcut No.196), as described
by Vitruvius,[144] the nave had two storeys of columns all round, and
the middle was open to the sky.Dorpfield that the temple in Vitruvius’s time was incomplete, and that
subsequently when Hadrian erected the great chryselephantine statue in
it the nave may have lost its hypæthral source of light.(In that case
its light may have been introduced through the court or hypæthron in
front of the cell, such as is shown on the plan in Woodcut No.The Ionic temples of Asia are all too much ruined to enable us to say
exactly in what manner, and to what extent, this mode of lighting was
applied to them, though there seems no doubt that the method there
adopted was very similar in all its main features.Elevation of West End of Erechtheium.The little Temple of Nikè Apteros and the temple on the Ilissus, were
both too small to require any complicated arrangement of the sort, but
the Ionic temple of Pandrosus was lighted by windows which still remain
at the west end, so that it is possible the same expedient may have been
adopted to at least some extent in the Asiatic examples.The latter,
however, is, with one exception, the sole instance of windows in any
European-Greek temple, the only other example being in the very
exceptional temple at Agrigentum.It is valuable, besides, as showing
how little the Greeks were bound by rules or by any fancied laws of
symmetry.As is shown in the plan, elevation, and view (Woodcuts Nos.155, 156,
157), the Erechtheium consisted, properly speaking, of 3 temples grouped
together; and it is astonishing what pains the architect took to prevent
their being mistaken for one.The porticoes of two of them are on
different levels, and the third or caryatide porch is of a different
height and different style.Every one of these features is perfectly
symmetrical in itself, and the group is beautifully balanced and
arranged; and yet no Gothic architect in his wildest moments could have
conceived anything more picturesquely irregular than the whole becomes.Indeed, there can be no greater mistake than to suppose that Greek
architecture was fettered by any fixed laws of formal symmetry: each
detail, every feature, every object, such as a hall or temple, which
could be considered as one complete and separate whole, was perfectly
symmetrical and regular; but no two buildings—no two apartments—if for
different purposes, were made to look like one.On the contrary, it is
quite curious to observe what pains they took to arrange their buildings
so as to produce variety and contrast, instead of formality or
singleness of effect.Temples, when near one another, were never placed
parallel, nor were even their propylæa and adjuncts ever so arranged as
to be seen together or in one line.The Egyptians, as before remarked,
had the same feeling, but carried it into even the details of the same
building, which the Greeks did not.In this, indeed, as in almost every
other artistic mode of expression, they seem to have hit exactly the
happy medium, so as to produce the greatest harmony with the greatest
variety, and to satisfy the minutest scrutiny and the most refined
taste, while their buildings produced an immediate and striking effect
on even the most careless and casual beholders.Owing to the Erechtheium having been converted into a Byzantine church
during the Middle Ages, almost all traces of its original internal
arrangements have been obliterated, and this, with the peculiar
combination of three temples in one, makes it more than usually
difficult to restore.The annexed plan, however, meets all the
requirements of the case in so far as they are known.To the east was a
portico of 6 columns, between two of which stood an altar to Dione,
mentioned in the inscription enumerating the repairs in 409 B.C.;[145]
inside, according to Pausanias,[146] were three altars, the principal
dedicated to Poseidon, the others to Butes and Hephaistos.From its
form, it is evident the roof must have been supported by pillars, and
they probably also bore a clerestory, by which, I believe, with rare
exceptions, all Greek temples were lighted.Restored Plan of Erechtheium.The dark parts remain; the shaded are restorations.
]The Temple of Pandrosus was on a lower level, and was approached by a
flight of steps, corresponding with which was a chamber, containing the
well of salt water, and which apparently was the abode of the
serpent-god Erechthonios, mentioned by Herodotus.[147] The central cell
was lighted by the very exceptional expedient of 3 windows in the
western wall, which looked directly into it.Beyond this, on the south,
was the beautiful caryatide porch, where, if anywhere within the temple,
grew the olive sacred to Minerva.Unfortunately, our principal guide,
Pausanias, does not give us a hint where the olive-tree grew, and on the
whole I am inclined to believe it was in the enclosure outside the
western wall of the temple,[148] and to which a doorway leads directly
from the Temple of Pandrosus, as well as one under the north portico,
the use of which it is impossible to explain unless we assume that this
enclosure was really of exceptional importance.TEMPLE OF DIANA AT EPHESUS.A history of Grecian architecture can hardly be considered as complete
without some mention of the great Ephesian temple, which was one of the
largest and most gorgeous of all those erected by the Greeks, and
considered by them as one of the seven wonders of the world.Strange to
say, till very recently even its situation was utterly unknown; and even
now that it has been revealed to us by the energy and intelligence of
Mr.Wood, scarcely enough remains to enable him to restore the plan with
anything like certainty.This is the more remarkable, as it was found
buried under 17 to 20 feet of mud, which must have been the accumulation
of centuries, and might, one would have thought, have preserved
considerable portions of it from the hand of the spoiler.Plan of the Temple of Diana at Ephesus, embodying
Mr.Wood’s researches embodies all the
information he has been able to obtain.The dimensions of the double
peristyle, and the number and position of its 96 columns, are quite
certain.So are the positions of the north, south, and west walls of the
cella; so that the only points of uncertainty are the positions of the
four columns necessary to make up the 100 mentioned by Pliny,[149] and
the internal arrangement of the cella itself and of the opisthodomus.With regard to the first there seems very little latitude for choice.The position of the other two must
be determined either by bringing forward the wall enclosing the stairs,
so as to admit of the intercolumniation east and west being the same as
that of the other columns, or of spacing them so as to divide the inner
roof of the pronaos into equal squares.I have preferred the latter as
that which appears to me the most probable.[150]

The west wall of the cella and the position of the statue having been
found, the arrangement of the pillars surrounding this apartment does
not admit of much latitude.Fragments of these pillars were found, but
not _in situ_, showing that they were in two heights and supported a
gallery.I have spaced them intermediately between the external pillars,
as in the Temple of Apollo at Bassæ (Woodcut No.149), because I do not
know of any other mode by which this temple could be lighted, except by
an opaion, as suggested for that temple; and if this is so they must
have been so spaced.Carrying out this system it leaves an opisthodomus
which is an exact square, which is so likely a form for that apartment
that it affords considerable confirmation to the correctness of this
restoration that it should be so.The four pillars it probably contained
are so spaced as to divide it into nine equal squares.Restored in this manner the temple appears considerably less in
dimensions than might have been supposed from Pliny’s text.His
measurements apply only to the lower step of the platform, which is
found to be 421 ft.But the temple itself, from angle to angle
of the peristyles, is only 342 ft.Assuming this restoration to be correct there can be very little doubt
as to the position of the thirty-six columnæ cælatæ, of which several
specimens have been recovered by Mr.Wood, and are now in the British
Museum.They must have been the sixteen at either end and the four in
the pronaos, shown darker in the woodcut.From the temple standing on a platform so much larger than appears
necessary, it is probable that pedestals with statues stood in front of
each column, and if this were so, the sculptures, with the columnæ
cælatæ and the noble architecture of the temple itself, must have made
up a combination of technic, æsthetic, and phonetic art such as hardly
existed anywhere else, and which consequently the ancients were quite
justified in considering as one of the wonders of the world.MUNICIPAL ARCHITECTURE.Very little now remains of all the various classes of municipal and
domestic buildings which must once have covered the land of Greece, and
from what we know of the exquisite feelings for art that pervaded that
people, they were certainly not less beautiful, though more ephemeral,
than the sacred buildings whose ruins still remain to us.There are, however, two buildings in Athens which, though small, give us
most exalted ideas of their taste in such matters.The first, already
alluded to, usually known as the Tower of the Winds, is a plain
octagonal building about 45 ft.in height by 24 in width, ornamented by
2 small porches of 2 pillars each, of the Corinthian order, the capitals
of which are represented in Woodcut No.Its roof, like the rest of
the building, is of white marble, and of simple but very elegant design,
and below this is a frieze of 8 large figures, symbolical of the 8
winds, from which the tower takes its name, they in fact being the
principal objects and ornaments of the building, the most important use
of which appears to have been to contain a clepsydra or water-clock.The other building, though smaller, is still more beautiful.It is known
as the Choragic Monument of Lysicrates, and consists of a square base 12
ft.wide, on which stands a circular temple adorned by 6
Corinthian columns, which, with their entablature and the roof and
pedestal they support, make up 22 ft.more, so that the whole height of
the monument is only 34 ft.Notwithstanding these insignificant
dimensions, the beauty of its columns (Woodcut No.143) and of their
entablature—above all, the beauty of the roof and of the finial
ornament, which crowns the whole and is unrivalled for elegance even in
Greek art—make up a composition so perfect that nothing in any other
style or age can be said to surpass it.[151] If this is a fair index of
the art that was lavished on the smaller objects, the temples hardly
give a just idea of all that have perished.In extreme contrast with the buildings last described, which were among
the smallest, came the theatres, which were the largest, of the
monuments the Greeks seem ever to have attempted.The annexed plan of one at Dramyssus, the ancient Dodona, will give an
idea of their forms and arrangements.Its dimensions may be said to be
gigantic, being 443 ft.across; but even this, though perhaps the
largest in Greece, is far surpassed by many in Asia Minor.What remains
of it, however, is merely the auditorium, and consists only of ranges of
seats arranged in a semicircle, but without architectural ornament.In
all the examples in Europe, the proscenium,[152] which was the only part
architecturally ornamented, has perished, so that, till we can restore
this with something like certainty, the theatres hardly come within the
class of Architecture as a fine art.The theatre of Dionysus at Athens, which was excavated and laid bare in
1862-63, measures only 165 ft.Built on the south
side of the Acropolis, the natural <DW72> forming the rising ground was
utilised for the foundations of the tiers of seats which, in some cases,
and particularly at the back, were hewn in the rock; so that they were
carried back 294 ft.In the theatre of
Epidaurus, which, according to Pausanias, was the most beautiful theatre
in the world, the lines of the seats are continued on each side of the
orchestra so as to form a horse-shoe on plan; the foundations of the
stage, the projecting side wings with staircases on each side, and other
buildings belonging to the stage are still preserved.In Asia Minor some of the theatres have their proscenia adorned with
niches and columns, and friezes of great richness; but all these belong
to the Roman period, and, though probably copies of the mode in which
the Greeks ornamented theirs, are so corrupt in style as to prevent
their being used with safety in attempting to restore the earlier
examples.Many circumstances would indeed induce us to believe that the proscenia
of the earlier theatres may have been of wood or bronze, or both
combined, and heightened by painting and carving to a great degree of
richness.This, though appropriate and consonant with the origin and
history of the drama, would be fatal to the expectation of anything
being found to illustrate its earliest forms.Like the other Aryan races, the Greeks never were tomb-builders, and
nothing of any importance of this class is found in Greece, except the
tombs of the early Pelasgic races, which were either tumuli, or
treasuries, as they are popularly called.There are, it is true, some
headstones and small pillars of great beauty, but they are monolithic,
and belong rather to the department of Sculpture than of Architecture.In Asia Minor there are some important tombs, some built and others cut
in the rock.Some of the latter have been described before in speaking
of the tombs of the Lycians.The built examples which remain almost all
belong to the Roman period, though the typical and by far the most
splendid example of Greek tombs was that erected by Artemisia to the
memory of her husband Mausolus at Halicarnassus.We scarcely know enough
of the ethnic relations of the Carians to be able to understand what
induced them to adopt so exceptional a mode of doing honour to their
dead.With pure Greeks it must have been impossible, but the inhabitants
of these coasts were of a different race, and had a different mode of
expressing their feelings.View of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, as restored
by the Author.]Till Sir Charles Newton’s visit to Halicarnassus in 1856 the very site
of this seventh wonder of the world was a matter of dispute.We now know
enough to be able to restore the principal parts with absolute
certainty, and to ascertain its dimensions and general appearance within
very insignificant limits of error.[153]

The dimensions quoted by Pliny[154] are evidently extracted from a
larger work, said to have been written by the architect who erected it,
and which existed at his time.Every one of them has been confirmed in
the most satisfactory manner by recent discoveries, and enable us to put
the whole together without much hesitation.Plan of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, from a
Drawing by the Author.Sufficient remains of the quadriga, which crowned the monument, have
been brought home to give its dimensions absolutely.All the parts of
the Ionic order are complete.The steps of the pyramid have been found
and portions of the three friezes, and these, with Pliny’s dimensions
and description, are all that are required to assure us that its aspect
must have been very similar to the form represented in Woodcut No.There can be little doubt with regard to the upper storey, but in order
to work out to the dimensions given by Pliny (411 ft.in circumference)
and those found cut out in the rock (462 ft.), the lower storey must be
spread out beyond the upper to that extent, and most probably something
after the manner shown in the woodcut.The building consisted internally of two chambers superimposed the one
on the other, each 52 ft.by 42 ft.—the lower one being the
vestibule to the tomb beyond—the upper was surrounded by a peristyle of
36 columns.Externally the height was divided into three equal portions
of 37 ft.each (25 cubits), one of which was allotted to the
base—one to the pyramid with its meta—and one to the order between them.These with 14 ft., the height of the quadriga, and the same dimension
belonging to the lower entablature, made up the height of 140 Greek
feet[155] given it by Pliny.Though its height was unusually great for a Greek building, its other
dimensions were small.The admiration
therefore which the Greeks expressed regarding it must have arisen,
first, from the unusual nature of its design and of the purpose to which
it was applied, or perhaps more still from the extent and richness of
its sculptured decorations, of the beauty of which we are now enabled to
judge, and can fully share with them in admiring.Another, but very much smaller, tomb of about the same age was found by
Mr.Newton at Cnidus, and known as the Lion Tomb, from the figure of
that animal, now in the British Museum, which crowned its summit.Like
many other tombs found in Asia and in Africa, it follows the type of the
Mausoleum in its more important features.It possesses a base—a
peristyle—a pyramid of steps—and, lastly, an acroterion or pedestal
meant to support a quadriga or statue, or some other crowning object,
which appropriately terminated the design upwards.Several examples erected during the Roman period will be illustrated
when speaking of the architecture of that people, all bearing the
impress of the influence the Mausoleum had on the tomb architecture of
that age; but unfortunately we cannot yet go backwards and point out the
type from which the design of the Mausoleum itself was elaborated.The
tombs of Babylon and Passargadæ are remote both geographically and
artistically, though not without certain essential resemblances.Perhaps
the missing links may some day reward the industry of some scientific
explorer.At Cyrene there is a large group of tombs of Grecian date and with
Grecian details, but all cut in the rock, and consequently differing
widely in their form from those just described.It is not clear whether
the circumstance of this city possessing such a necropolis arose from
its proximity to Egypt, and consequently from a mere desire to imitate
that people, or from some ethnic peculiarity.Most probably the latter,
though we know so little about them that it is difficult to speak with
precision on such a subject.[156]

These tombs are chiefly interesting from many of the details of the
architecture still retaining the colour with which they were originally
adorned.The triglyphs of the Doric order are still painted blue,[157]
as appears to have been the universal practice, and the pillars are
outlined by red lines.The metopes are darker, and are adorned with
painted groups of figures, the whole making up one of the most perfect
examples of Grecian  decoration which still remain.Rock-cut and structural Tombs at Cyrene.(From
Hamilton’s ‘Wanderings in North Africa.’)]

There is another tomb at the same place—this time structural—which is
interesting not so much for any architectural beauty it possesses as
from its belonging to an exceptional type.It consists now only of a
circular basement—the upper part is gone—and is erected over an
excavated rock-cut tomb.There seem to be several others of the same
class in the necropolis, and they are the only examples known except
those at Marathos, one of which is illustrated above (Woodcut No.As before hinted, the Syrian example does not appear to be very ancient,
but we want further information before speaking positively on this
subject.No one on the spot has attempted to fix with precision the age
of the Cyrenean examples; nor have they been drawn in such detail as is
requisite for others to ascertain the fact.They may be as late as the
time of the Romans, but can hardly be dated as prior to the age of
Alexander the Great.(From Hamilton’s ‘North Africa.’)]


                         DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE.We have nothing left but imperfect verbal descriptions of the domestic,
and even of the palatial architecture of Greece, and, consequently, can
only judge imperfectly of its forms.Unfortunately, too, Pompeii, though
but half a Greek city, belongs to too late and too corrupt an age to
enable us to use it even as an illustration; but we may rest assured
that in this, as in everything else, the Greeks displayed the same
exquisite taste which pervades not only their monumental architecture,
but all their works in metal or clay, down to the meanest object, which
have been preserved to our times.It is probable that the forms of their houses were much more irregular
and picturesque than we are in the habit of supposing them to have been.They seem to have taken such pains in their temples—in the Erechtheium,
for instance, and at Eleusis—to make every part tell its own tale, that
anything like forced regularity must have been offensive to them, and
they would probably make every apartment exactly of the dimensions
required, and group them so that no one should under any circumstances
be confounded with another.This, however, with all the details of their domestic arts, must now
remain to us as mere speculation, and the architectural history of
Greece must be confined to her temples and monumental erections.These
suffice to explain the nature and forms of the art, and to assign to it
the rank of the purest and most intellectual of all the styles which
have yet been invented or practised in any part of the world.ETRUSCAN AND ROMAN ARCHITECTURE.CHAPTER I.

The ethnographical history of art in Italy is in all its essential
features similar to that of Greece, though arriving at widely different
results from causes the influence of which it is easy to trace.Both are
examples of an Aryan development based on a Turanian civilisation which
it has superseded.In Greece—as already remarked—the traces of the
earlier people are indistinct and difficult to seize.In Italy their
features are drawn with a coarser hand, and extend down into a more
essentially historic age.It thus happens that we have no doubt as to
the existence of the Etruscan people—we know very nearly who they were,
and cannot be mistaken as to the amount and kind of influence they
exercised on the institutions and arts of the Romans.The more striking differences appear to have arisen from the fact, that
Greece had some four or five centuries of comparative repose during
which to form herself and her institutions after the Pelasgic
civilisation was struck down at the time of the Dorian occupation of the
Peloponnesus.During that period she was undisturbed by foreign
invasion, and was not tempted by successful conquests to forsake the
gentler social arts for the more vulgar objects of national ambition.Rome’s history, on the other hand, from the earliest aggregation of a
robber horde on the banks of the Tiber till she became the arbiter of
the destinies of the ancient world, is little beyond the record of
continuous wars.From the possession of the seven hills, Rome gradually
carried her sway at the edge of the sword to the dominion of the whole
of Italy and of all the then known world, destroying everything that
stood in the way of her ambition, and seeking only the acquisition of
wealth and power.Greece, in the midst of her successful cultivation of the arts of
commerce and of peace, stimulated by the wholesome rivalry of the
different States of which she was composed, was awakened by the Persian
invasion to a struggle for existence.The result was one of the most
brilliant passages in the world’s history, and no nation was ever more
justified in the jubilant outburst of enthusiastic patriotism that
followed the repulse of the invader, than was Greece in that with which
she commenced her short but brilliant career.A triumph so gained by a
people so constituted led to results at which we still wonder, though
they cause us no surprise.If Greece attained her manhood on the
battle-fields of Marathon and Salamis, Rome equally reached the maturity
of her career when she cruelly and criminally destroyed Corinth and
Carthage, and the sequel was such as might be expected from such a
difference of education.Rome had no time for the cultivation of the
arts of peace, and as little sympathy for their gentler influences.Conquest, wealth, and consequent power, were the objects of her
ambition—for these she sacrificed everything, and by their means she
attained a pinnacle of greatness that no nation had reached before or
has since.Her arts have all the impress of this greatness, and are
characterised by the same vulgar grandeur which marks everything she
did.Very different they are from the intellectual beauty found in the
works of the Greeks, but in some respects they are as interesting to
those who can read the character of nations in their artistic
productions.In the earlier part of her career Rome was an Etruscan city under
Etruscan kings and institutions.After she had emancipated herself from
their yoke, Etruria long remained her equal and her rival in political
power, and her instructress in religion and the arts of peace.This
continued so long, and the architectural remains of that people are so
numerous, and have been so thoroughly investigated, that we have no
difficulty in ascertaining the extent of influence the older nation had
on the nascent empire.It is more difficult to ascertain exactly who the
Etruscans themselves were, or whence they came.But on the whole there
seems every reason to believe they migrated from Asia Minor some twelve
or thirteen centuries before the Christian era, and fixed themselves in
Italy, most probably among the Umbrians, or some people of cognate race,
who had settled there before—so long before, perhaps, as to entitle them
to be considered among the aboriginal inhabitants.It would have been only natural that the expatriated Trojans should have
sought refuge among such a kindred people, though we have nothing but
the vaguest tradition to warrant a belief that this was the case.They
may too from time to time have received other accessions to their
strength; but they were a foreign people in a strange land, and scarcely
seem ever to have become naturalised in the country of their adoption.But what stood still more in their way was the fact that they were an
old Turanian people in presence of a young and ambitious community of
Aryan origin, and, as has always been the case when this has happened,
they were destined to disappear.Before doing so, however, they left
their impress on the institutions and the arts of their conquerors to
such an extent as to be still traceable in every form.It may have been
that there was as much Pelasgic blood in the veins of the Greeks as
there was Etruscan in those of the Romans; but the civilisation of the
former had passed away before Greece had developed herself.Etruria, on
the other hand, was long contemporary with Rome: in early times her
equal, and sometimes her mistress, and consequently in a position to
force her arts upon her to an extent that was never effected on the
opposite shore of the Adriatic.Nothing can prove more clearly the Turanian origin of the Etruscans than
the fact that all we know of them is derived from their tombs.These
exist in hundreds—it may almost be said in thousands—at the gates of
every city; but no vestige of a temple has come down to our days.Had
any Semitic blood flowed in their veins, as has been sometimes
suspected, they could not have been so essentially sepulchral as they
were, or so fond of contemplating death, as is proved by the fact that a
purely Semitic tomb is still a desideratum among antiquaries, not one
having as yet been discovered.What we should like to find in Etruria
would be a square pyramidal mound with external steps leading to a cella
on its summit; but no trace of any such has yet been detected.Their
other temples—using the word in the sense in which we usually understand
it—were, as might be expected, insignificant and ephemeral.So much so,
indeed, that except from one passage in Vitruvius,[158] and our being
able to detect the influence of the Etruscan style in the buildings of
Imperial Rome, we should hardly be aware of their existence.The truth
seems to be that the religion of the Etruscans, like that of most of
their congeners, was essentially ancestral, and their worship took the
form of respect for the remains of the dead and reverence for their
memory.Tombs consequently, and not temples, were the objects on which
they lavished their architectural resources.They certainly were not
idolaters, in the sense in which we usually understand the term.They
had no distinct or privileged priesthood, and consequently had no motive
for erecting temples which by their magnificence should be pleasing to
their gods or tend to the glorification of their kings or priests.Still
less were they required for congregational purposes by the people at
large.The only individual temple of Etruscan origin of which we have any
knowledge, is that of Capitoline Jupiter at Rome.[159] Originally small,
it was repaired and rebuilt till it became under the Empire a splendid
fane.But not one vestige of it now remains, nor any description from
which we could restore its appearance with anything like certainty.From the chapter of the work of Vitruvius just alluded to, we learn that
the Etruscans had two classes of temples: one circular, like their
structural tombs, and dedicated to one deity; the other class
rectangular, but these, always possessing three cells, were devoted to
the worship of three gods.Plan and Elevation of an Etruscan Temple.]The general arrangement of the plan, as described by Vitruvius, was that
shown on the plan above (Fig.1), and is generally assented to by all
those who have attempted the restoration.In larger temples in Roman
times the number of pillars in front may have been doubled, and they
would thus be arranged like those of the portico of the Pantheon, which
is essentially an Etruscan arrangement.The restoration of the elevation
is more difficult, and the argument too long to be entered upon
here;[160] but its construction and proportions seem to have been very
much like those drawn in the above diagram (Fig.Of course, as
wooden structures, they were richly and elaborately carved, and the
effect heightened by colours, but it is in vain to attempt to restore
them.Without a single example to guide us, and with very little
collateral evidence which can at all be depended upon, it is hardly
possible that any satisfactory restoration could now be made.Moreover,
their importance in the history of art is so insignificant, that the
labour such an attempt must involve would hardly be repaid by the
result.The original Etruscan circular temple seems to have been a mere circular
cell with a porch.The Romans surrounded it with a peristyle, which
probably did not exist in the original style.They magnified it
afterwards into the most characteristic and splendid of all their
temples, the Pantheon, whose portico is Etruscan in arrangement and
design, and whose cell still more distinctly belongs to that order; nor
can there be any doubt that the simpler Roman temples of circular form
are derived from Etruscan originals.[161] It would therefore be of great
importance if we could illustrate the later buildings from existing
remains of the older: but the fact is that such deductions as we may
draw from the copies are our only source of information respecting the
originals.We know little of any of the civil buildings with which the cities of
Etruria were adorned, beyond the knowledge obtained from the remains of
their theatres and amphitheatres.The form of the latter was essentially
Etruscan, and was adopted by the Romans, with whom it became their most
characteristic and grandest architectural object.Of the amphitheatres
of ancient Etruria only one now remains in so perfect a state as to
enable us to judge of their forms.It is that at Sutrium, which,
however, being entirely cut in the rock, neither affords information as
to the mode of construction nor enables us to determine its age.in its greatest length by 265 in breadth,
and it is consequently much nearer a circular form than the Romans
generally adopted: but in other respects the arrangements are such as
appear to have usually prevailed in after times.Besides these, we have numerous works of utility, but these belong more
strictly to engineering than to architectural science.The city walls of
the Etruscans surpass those of any other ancient nation in extent and
beauty of workmanship.Their drainage works and their bridges, as well
as those of the kindred Pelasgians in Greece, still remain monuments of
their industrial science and skill, which their successors never
surpassed.On the whole, perhaps we are justified in asserting that the Etruscans
were not an architectural people, and had no temples or palaces worthy
of attention.It at least seems certain that nothing of the sort is now
to be found, even in ruins, and were it not that the study of Etruscan
art is a necessary introduction to that of Roman, it would hardly be
worth while trying to gather together and illustrate the few fragments
and notices of it that remain.The tombs of the Etruscans now found may be divided into two
classes—first, those cut in the rock, and resembling dwelling-houses;
secondly, the circular tumuli, which latter are by far the most numerous
and important class.Each of these may be again subdivided into two kinds.The rock-cut tombs
include, firstly, those with only a façade on the face of the rock and a
sepulchral chamber within; secondly, those cut quite out of the rock and
standing free all round.To this class probably once belonged an immense
number of tombs built in the ordinary way; but all these have totally
disappeared, and consequently the class, as now under consideration,
consists entirely of excavated examples.The second class may be divided into those tumuli erected over chambers
cut in the tufaceous rock which is found all over Etruria, and those
which have chambers built above-ground.In the present state of our knowledge it is impossible to say which of
these classes is the older.We know that the Egyptians buried in caves
long before the Etruscans landed in Italy, and at the same time raised
pyramids over rock-cut and built chambers.We know too that Abraham was
buried in the Cave of Machpelah in Syria.On the other hand, the tombs
at Smyrna (Woodcut No.113), the treasuries of Mycenæ (Woodcut No.124),
the sepulchre of Alyattes (Woodcut No.115), and many others, are proofs
of the antiquity of the tumuli, which are found all over Europe and
Asia, and appear to have existed from the earliest ages.The comparative antiquity of the different kinds of tombs being thus
doubtful, it will be sufficient for the purposes of the present work to
classify them architecturally.It may probably be assumed, with safety,
that all the modes which have been enumerated were practised by the
Etruscans at a period very slightly subsequent to their migration into
Italy.Of the first class of the rock-cut tombs—those with merely a façade
externally—the most remarkable group is that at Castel d’Asso.At this
place there is a perpendicular cliff with hundreds of these tombs ranged
along its face, like houses in a street.A similar arrangement is found
in Egypt at Benihasan, at Petra, and Cyrene, and around all the more
ancient cities of Asia Minor.In Etruria they generally consist of one chamber lighted by the doorway
only.Their internal arrangement appears to be an imitation of a
dwelling chamber, with furniture, like the apartment itself, cut out of
the rock.Externally they have little or no pretension to architectural
decoration.It is true that some tombs are found adorned with
frontispieces of a debased Doric or Ionic order; but these were executed
at a much later period and under Roman domination, and cannot therefore
be taken as specimens of Etruscan art, but rather of that corruption of
style sure to arise from a conquered people trying to imitate the arts
of their rulers.Tombs at Castel d’Asso.(From the ‘Annale del
Instituto.’)]

The general appearance of the second class of rock-cut tombs will be
understood from the woodcut (No.168), representing two monuments at
Castel d’Asso.Unfortunately neither is complete, nor is there any
complete example known to exist of this class.Perhaps the apex was
added structurally and that these, like all such things in Etruria, have
perished.Possibly, if cut in the rock, the terminals were slender
carved ornaments, and therefore liable to injury.They are usually
restored by antiquaries in the shape of rectilinear pyramids, but so far
as I know, there is no authority for this.On the contrary, it is more
in accordance with what we know of the style and its affinities to
suppose that the termination of these monuments, even if added in
masonry, was curvilinear.Mouldings from Tombs at Castel d’Asso.]One remarkable thing about the rock-cut tombs is the form of their
mouldings, which differ from any found elsewhere in Europe.Two of these
are shown in the annexed woodcut (No.They are very numerous and
in great variety, but do not in any instance show the slightest trace of
a cornice, nor of any tendency towards one.On the contrary, in place of
this, we find nothing but a reverse moulding.It is probable that
similar forms may be found in Asia Minor, while something resembling
them actually occurs at Persepolis and elsewhere.It is remarkable that
this feature did not penetrate to Rome, and that no trace of its
influence is found there, as might have been expected.[162]


                                TUMULI.The simplest, and therefore perhaps the earliest, monument which can be
erected over the graves of the dead, by a people who reverence their
departed relatives, is a mound of earth or a cairn of stones, and such
seems to have been the form adopted by the Turanian or Tartar races of
mankind from the earliest days to the present hour.It is scarcely
necessary to remark how universal such monuments were among the ruder
tribes of Northern Europe.The Etruscans improved upon this by
surrounding the base with a _podium_, or supporting wall of masonry.This not only defined its limits and gave it dignity, but enabled
entrances to be made in it, and otherwise converted it from a mere
hillock into a monumental structure.It is usually supposed that this
basement was an invariable part of all Etruscan tumuli, and when it is
not found, it is assumed that it has been removed, or that it is buried
in the rubbish of the mound.No doubt such a stone basement may easily
have been removed by the peasantry, or buried, but it is by no means
clear that this was invariably the case.It seems that the enclosure was
frequently a circle of stones or monumental steles, in the centre of
which the tumulus stood.The monuments have hitherto been so carelessly
examined and restored, that it is difficult to arrive at anything like
certainty with regard to the details of their structure.Nor can we draw
any certain conclusion from a comparison with other tumuli of cognate
races.The description by Herodotus of the tomb of Alyattes at Sardis
(Woodcut No.115), those described by Pausanias as existing in the
Peloponnesus, and the appearances of those at Mycenæ and Orchomenos,
might be interpreted either way; but those at Smyrna (Woodcut No.113),
and a great number at least of those in Etruria, have a structural
circle of stone as a supporting base to the mound.Plan of the Regulini Galeassi Tomb.These tumuli are found existing in immense numbers in every necropolis
of the Etruscans.A large space was generally set apart for the purpose
outside the walls of all their great cities.In these cemeteries the
tumuli are arranged in rows, like houses in streets.Even now we can
count them by hundreds, and in the neighbourhood of the largest
cities—at Vulci, for instance—almost by thousands.Most of them are now worn down by the effect of time to nearly the level
of the ground, though some of the larger ones still retain an imposing
appearance.Nearly all have been rifled at some early period, though the
treasures still discovered almost daily in some places show how vast
their extent was, and how much even now remains to be done before this
vast mine of antiquity can be said to be exhausted.One of the most remarkable among those that have been opened in modern
times is at Cervetri, the ancient Cære, known as the Regulini Galeassi
tomb, from the names of its discoverers.Sections of the Regulini Galeassi Tomb.(From
Canina’s ‘Etruria Antica.’) Scale for large section, 50 ft.Like a Nubian pyramid or Buddhist tope, it consists of an inner and
older tumulus, around and over which another has been added.In the
outer mound are five tombs either of dependent or inferior personages.These were rifled long ago; but the outer pyramid having effectually
concealed the entrance to the principal tomb, it remained untouched till
very lately, when it yielded to its discoverers a richer collection of
ornaments and utensils in gold and bronze than has ever been found in
one place before.The dimensions and arrangements of this tumulus will be understood from
Woodcuts Nos.170, 171, and from the two sections of the principal tomb
which are annexed to them.These last display an irregularity of
construction very unusual in such cases, for which no cause can be
assigned.The usual section is perfectly regular, as in the annexed
woodcut (No.172), taken from another tomb at the same place.These chambers, like all those of the early Etruscans, are vaulted on
the horizontal principle, like the tombs at Mycenæ and Orchomenos,
though none are found in Italy at all equal to those of Greece in
dimensions or beauty of construction.173 is a perspective view of the principal chamber in the
Regulini Galeassi tomb, showing the position of the furniture found in
it when first opened, consisting of biers or bedsteads, shields, arrows,
and vessels of various sorts.A number of vases are hung in a curious
recess in the roof, the form of which would be inexplicable but for the
utensils found in it.With this clue to its meaning we can scarcely
doubt that it represents a place for hanging such vessels in the houses
of the living.All the treasures found in this tomb are in the oldest style of Etruscan
art, and are so similar to the bronzes and ornaments brought by Layard
from Assyria as to lead to the belief that they had a common origin.The
tomb, with its contents, probably dates from the 9th or 10th century
before the Christian era.The largest tomb hitherto discovered in Etruria is now known as the
Cocumella, in the necropolis at Vulci.in
diameter, and originally could not have been less than 115 or 120 ft.in
height, though now it only rises to 50 ft.View of principal Chamber in the Regulini Galeassi
Tomb.]Near its centre are the remains of two solid towers, one circular, the
other square, neither of them actually central, nor are they placed in
such a way that we can understand how they can have formed a part of any
symmetrical design.A plan and a view of the present appearance of this
monument are given in Woodcuts 174 and 175.This tumulus, with its principal remaining features thus standing on one
side of the centre, may possibly assist us to understand the curious
description found in Pliny[163] of the tomb of Porsenna.This
description is quoted from Varro, being evidently regarded by Pliny
himself as not a little apocryphal.According to this account it
consisted of a square basement 300 ft.each way, from which arose five
pyramids, united at the summit by a bronze circle or cupola.This was
again surmounted by four other pyramids, the summits of which were again
united at a height of 300 ft.From this point rose
still five more pyramids, whose height Varro (from modesty, as Pliny
surmises) omits to state, but which was estimated in Etruscan traditions
at the same height as the rest of the monument.This last statement,
which does not rest on any real authority, may well be regarded as
exaggerated; but if we take the total height as about 400 ft., it is
easy to understand that in the age of Pliny, when all the buildings were
low, such a structure, as high as the steeple at Salisbury, would appear
fabulous; but the vast piles that have been erected by tomb-building
races in other parts of the earth render it by no means improbable that
Varro was justified in what he asserted.[164]

Near the gate of Albano is found a small tomb of five pyramidal pillars
rising from a square base, exactly corresponding with Varro’s
description of the lower part of the tomb of Porsenna.It is called by
tradition the tomb of Aruns, the son of Porsenna, though the character
of the mouldings with which it is adorned would lead us to assign to it
a more modern date.It consists of a lofty podium, on which are placed
five pyramids, a large one in the centre and four smaller ones at the
angles.Its present appearance is shown in the annexed woodcut (No.There are not in Etruria any features sufficiently marked to
characterise a style of architecture, nor any pillars with their
accessories which can be considered to constitute an order.It is true
that in some of the rock-cut tombs square piers support the roof; and in
one or two instances rounded pillars are found, but these are either
without mouldings or ornamented only with Roman details, betraying the
lateness of their execution.The absence of built examples of the class
of tombs found in the rock prevents us from recognising any of those
peculiarities of construction which sometimes are as characteristic of
the style and as worthy of attention as the more purely ornamental
parts.From their city gates, their aqueducts and bridges, we know that the
Etruscans used the radiating arch at an early age, with deep voussoirs
and elegant mouldings, giving it that character of strength which the
Romans afterwards imparted to their works of the same class.The Cloaca
Maxima of Rome (Woodcut No.104) must be considered as a work executed
under Etruscan superintendence, and a very perfect specimen of the
class.At the same time the Etruscans used the pointed arch, constructed
horizontally, and seem to have had the same predilection for it which
characterised the cognate Pelasgian race in Greece.A gateway at Arpino
(Woodcut No.177) is almost identical with that at Thoricus (Woodcut No.126), but larger and more elegant; and there are many specimens of the
same class found in Italy.The portion of an aqueduct at Tusculum, shown
in Woodcut No.178, is a curious transition specimen, where the two
stones meeting at the apex (usually called the Egyptian form, being the
first step towards the true arch) are combined with a substructure of
horizontal converging masonry.In either of these instances the horizontal arch is a legitimate mode of
construction, and may have been used long after the principle of the
radiating arch was known.The great convenience of the latter, as
enabling large spaces to be spanned even with brick or the smallest
stones, and thus dispensing with the necessity for stones of very large
dimensions, led ultimately to its universal adoption.Subsequently, when
the pointed form of the radiating arch was introduced, no motive
remained for the retention of the horizontal method, and it was entirely
abandoned.We now approach the last revolution that completed and closed the great
cycle of the arts and civilisation of the ancient world.We have seen
Art spring Minerva-like, perfect from the head of her great parent, in
Egypt.We have admired it in Assyria, rich, varied, but unstable; aiming
at everything, but never attaining maturity or perfection.We have tried
to trace the threads of early Pelasgic art in Asia, Greece, and Etruria,
spreading their influence over the world, and laying the foundation of
other arts which the Pelasgi were incapable of developing.We have seen
all these elements gathered together in Greece, the essence extracted
from each, and the whole forming the most perfect and beautiful
combinations of intellectual power that the world has yet witnessed.We
have now only to contemplate the last act in the great drama, the
gorgeous but melancholy catastrophe by which all these styles of
architecture were collected in wild confusion in Rome, and there
perished beneath the luxury and crimes of that mighty people, who for a
while made Rome the capital of Europe.View them as we will, the arts of Rome were never an indigenous or
natural production of the soil or people, but an aggregation of foreign
styles in a state of transition from the old and time-honoured forms of
Pagan antiquity to the new development introduced by Christianity.We
cannot of course suppose that the Romans foresaw the result to which
their amalgamation of previous styles was tending; still they advanced
as steadily towards that result as if a prophetic spirit had guided them
to a well-defined conception of what was to be.It was not however
permitted to the Romans to complete this task.Long before the ancient
methods and ideas had been completely moulded into the new, the power of
Rome sank beneath her corruption, and a long pause took place, during
which the Christian arts did not advance in Western Europe beyond the
point they had reached in the age of Constantine.Indeed, in many
respects, they receded from it during the dark ages.When they
reappeared in the 10th and 11th centuries it was in an entirely new garb
and with scarcely a trace of their origin—so distinct indeed that it
appears more like a reinvention than a reproduction of forms long since
familiar to the Roman world.Had Rome retained her power and
pre-eminence a century or two longer, a style might have been elaborated
as distinct from that of the ancient world, and as complete in itself,
as our pointed Gothic, and perhaps more beautiful.Such was not the
destiny of the world; and what we have now to do is to examine this
transition style as we find it in ancient Rome, and familiarise
ourselves with the forms it took during the three centuries of its
existence, as without this knowledge all the arts of the Gothic era
would for ever remain an inexplicable mystery.The chief value of the
Roman style consists in the fact that it contains the germs of all that
is found in the Middle Ages, and affords the key by which its mysteries
may be unlocked, and its treasures rendered available.Had the
transition been carried through in the hands of an art-loving and
artistic people, the architectural beauties of Rome must have surpassed
those of any other city in the world, for its buildings surpass in scale
those of Egypt and in variety those of Greece, while they affect to
combine the beauties of both.In constructive ingenuity they far surpass
anything the world had seen up to that time, but this cannot redeem
offences against good taste, nor enable any Roman productions to command
our admiration as works of art, or entitle them to rank as models to be
followed either literally or in spirit.During the first two centuries and a half of her existence, Rome was
virtually an Etruscan city, wholly under Etruscan influence; and during
that period we read of temples and palaces being built and of works of
immense magnitude being undertaken for the embellishment of the city;
and we have even now more remains of kingly than we have of consular
Rome.After expelling her kings and shaking off Etruscan influence, Rome
existed as a republic for five centuries, and during this long age of
barbarism she did nothing to advance science or art.Literature was
almost wholly unknown within her walls, and not one monument has come
down to our time, even by tradition, worthy of a city of a tenth part of
her power and magnitude.There is probably no instance in the history of
the world of a capital city existing so long, populous and peaceful at
home, prosperous and powerful abroad, and at the same time so utterly
devoid of any monuments or any magnificence to dignify her existence.When, however, Carthage was conquered and destroyed, when Greece was
overrun and plundered, and Egypt, with her long-treasured art, had
become a dependent province, Rome was no longer the city of the Aryan
Romans, but the sole capital of the civilised world.Into her lap were
poured all the artistic riches of the universe; to Rome flocked all who
sought a higher distinction or a more extended field for their ambition
than their own provincial capitals could then afford.She thus became
the centre of all the arts and of all the science then known; and, so
far at least as quantity is concerned, she amply redeemed her previous
neglect of them.It seems an almost indisputable fact that, during the
three centuries of the Empire, more and larger buildings were erected in
Rome and her dependent cities than ever were erected in a like period in
any part of the world.For centuries before the establishment of the Roman Empire, progressive
development and increasing population, joined to comparative peace and
security, had accumulated around the shores of the Mediterranean a mass
of people enjoying material prosperity greater than had ever been known
before.All this culminated in the first centuries of the Christian era.The greatness of the ancient world was then full, and a more
overwhelming and gorgeous spectacle than the Roman Empire then displayed
never dazzled the eyes of mankind.From the banks of the Euphrates to
those of the Tagus, every city vied with its neighbour in the erection
of temples, baths, theatres, and edifices for public use or private
luxury.In all cases these display far more evidence of wealth and power
than of taste and refinement, and all exhibit traces of that haste to
enjoy, which seems incompatible with the correct elaboration of anything
that is to be truly great.Notwithstanding all this, there is a
greatness in the mass, a grandeur in the conception, and a certain
expression of power in all these Roman remains which never fail to
strike the beholder with awe and force admiration from him despite his
better judgment.These qualities, coupled with the associations that
attach themselves to every brick and every stone, render the study of
them irresistibly attractive.It was with Imperial Rome that the ancient
world perished; it was in her dominions that the new and Christian world
was born.All that was great in Heathendom was gathered within her
walls, tied, it is true, into an inextricable knot, which was cut by the
sword of those barbarians who moulded for themselves out of the
fragments that polity and those arts which will next occupy our
attention.To Rome all previous history tends; from Rome all modern
history springs: to her, therefore, and to her arts, we inevitably turn,
if not to admire, at least to learn, and if not to imitate, at any rate
to wonder at and to contemplate a phase of art as unknown to previous as
to subsequent history, and, if properly understood, more replete with
instruction than any other form hitherto known.Though the lesson we
learn from it is far oftener what to avoid than what to follow, still
there is such wisdom to be gathered from it as should guide us in the
onward path, which may lead us to a far higher grade than it was given
to Rome herself ever to attain.Origin of style—The arch—Orders: Doric, Ionic, Corinthian,

The earliest inhabitants of Rome were an Aryan or, as they used to be
called, Indo-Germanic race, who established themselves in a country
previously occupied by Pelasgians.Their principal neighbour on one side
was Etruria, a Pelasgian nation.On the other hand was Magna Græcia,
which had been colonised in very early ages by Hellenic settlers of
kindred origin.It was therefore impossible that the architecture of the
Romans should not be in fact a mixture of the styles of these two
people.As a transition order, it was only a mechanical juxtaposition of
both styles, the real fusion taking place many long centuries
afterwards.Throughout the Roman period the two styles remain distinct,
and there is no great difficulty in referring almost every feature in
Roman architecture to its origin.From the Greeks were borrowed the rectangular peristylar temple, with
its columns and horizontal architraves, though they seldom if ever used
it in its perfect purity, the cella of the Greek temples not being
sufficiently large for their purposes.The principal Etruscan temples,
as we have already shown, were square in plan, and the inner half
occupied by one or more cells, to the sides and back of which the
portico never extended.The Roman rectangular temple is a mixture of
these two: it is generally, like the Greek examples, longer than its
breadth, but the colonnade never seems to have entirely surrounded the
building.Sometimes it extends to the two sides as well as the front,
but more generally the cella occupies the whole of the inner part though
frequently ornamented by a false peristyle of three-quarter columns
attached to its walls.Besides this, the Romans borrowed from the Etruscans or Greeks a
circular form of temple.As applied by the Romans it was generally
encircled by a peristyle of columns, though it is not clear that the
Etruscans so used it; this may therefore be an improvement adopted from
the Greeks on an Etruscan form.In early times these circular temples
were dedicated to Vesta, Cybele, or some god or goddess either unknown
or not generally worshipped by the Aryan races; but in later times this
distinction was lost sight of.A more important characteristic which the Romans borrowed from the
Etruscans was the circular arch.It was known, it is true, to the
Egyptians, Assyrians, and Greeks; yet none of these people, perhaps
excepting the Assyrians, seem to have used it as a feature in their
ornamental architecture; but the Etruscans appear to have had a peculiar
predilection for it, and from them the Romans adopted it boldly, and
introduced it into almost all their buildings.It was not at first used
in temples of Grecian form, nor even in their peristylar circular ones.In the civil buildings of the Romans it was a universal feature, but was
generally placed in juxtaposition with the Grecian orders.In the
Colosseum, for instance, the whole construction is arched; but a useless
network of ill-designed and ill-arranged Grecian columns, with their
entablatures, is spread over the whole.This is a curious instance of
the mixture of the two styles, and as such is very characteristic of
Roman art; but in an artistic point of view the place of these columns
would have been far better supplied by buttresses or panels, or some
expedient more correctly constructive.After having thoroughly familiarised themselves with the forms of the
arch as an architectural feature, the Romans made a bold stride in
advance by applying it as a vault both to the circular and rectangular
forms of buildings.The most perfect examples of this are the rotunda of
the Pantheon and the basilica of Maxentius, commonly called the Temple
of Peace, strangely like each other in conception, though apparently so
distant in date.In these buildings the Roman architects so completely
emancipated themselves from the trammels of former styles as almost to
entitle them to claim the invention of a new order of architecture.It
would have required some more practice to invent details appropriate to
the purpose; still these two buildings are to this hour unsurpassed for
boldness of conception and just appreciation of the manner in which the
new method ought to be applied.This is almost universally acknowledged
so far as the interior of the Pantheon is concerned.In simple grandeur
it is as yet unequalled; its faults being principally those of detail.It is not so easy, however, to form an opinion of the Temple of Peace in
its present ruined state; but in so far as we can judge from what yet
remains of it, in boldness and majesty of conception it must have been
quite equal to the other example, though it must have required far more
familiarity with the style adopted to manage its design as appropriately
as the simpler dome of the Pantheon.These two buildings may be considered as exemplifying the extent to
which the Romans had progressed in the invention of a new style of
architecture and the state in which they left it to their successors.It
may however be worth while pointing out how, in transplanting Roman
architecture to their new capital on the shores of the Bosphorus, the
semi-Oriental nation seized on its own circular form, and, modifying and
moulding it to its purpose, wrought out the Byzantine style; in which
the dome is the great feature, almost to the total exclusion of the
rectangular form with its intersecting vaults.On the other hand, the
rectangular form was appropriated by the nations of the West with an
equally distinct rejection of the circular and domical forms, except in
those cases in which we find an Eastern people still incorporated with
them.Thus in Italy both styles continued long in use, the one in
baptisteries, the other in churches, but always kept distinct, as in
Rome.In France they were so completely fused into each other that it
requires considerable knowledge of architectural analysis to separate
them again into their component parts.In England we rejected the
circular form altogether, and so they did eventually in Germany, except
when under French influence.Each race reclaimed its own among the
spoils of Rome, and used it with the improvements it had acquired during
its employment in the Imperial city.The first thing that strikes the student in attempting to classify the
numerous examples of Roman architecture is the immense variety of
purposes to which it is applied, as compared with previous styles.In
Egypt architecture was applied only to temples, palaces and tombs.In
Greece it was almost wholly confined to temples and theatres; and in
Etruria to tombs.It is in Rome that we first feel that we have not to
deal with either a Theocracy or a kingdom, but with a great people, who
for the first time in the world’s history rendered architecture
subservient to the myriad wants of the many-headed monster.It thus
happens that in the Roman cities, in addition to temples we find
basilicas, theatres and amphitheatres, baths, palaces, tombs, arches of
triumph and pillars of victory, gates, bridges, and aqueducts, all
equally objects of architectural skill.The best of these, in fact, are
those which from previous neglect in other countries are here stamped
with originality.These would have been noble works indeed had it not
been that the Romans unsuccessfully applied to them those orders and
details of architecture which were intended only to be applied to
temples by other nations.In the time of Constantine these orders had
nearly died out, and were only subordinately used for decorative
purposes.In a little while they would have died out altogether, and the
Roman would have become a new and complete style; but, as before
remarked, this did not take place, and the most ancient orders therefore
still remain an essential part of Roman art.We find the old orders
predominating in the age of Augustus, and see them gradually die out as
we approach that of Constantine.Adopting the usual classification, the first of the Roman orders is the
Doric, which, like everything else in this style, takes a place about
half-way between the Tuscan wooden posts and the nobly simple order of
the Greeks.It no doubt was a great improvement on the former, but for
monumental purposes infinitely inferior to the latter.It was, however,
more manageable; and for forums or courtyards, or as a three-quarter
column between arcades, it was better adapted than the severer Greek
style, which, when so employed, not only loses almost all its beauty,
but becomes more unmeaning than the Roman.This fact was apparently
recognised; for there is not, so far as is known, a single Doric temple
throughout the Roman world.It would in consequence be most unfair to
institute a comparison between a mere utilitarian prop used only in
civil buildings and an order which the most refined artists in the world
spent all their ingenuity in rendering the most perfect, because it was
devoted to the highest religious purposes.The addition of an independent base made the order much more generally
useful, and its adoption brought it much more into harmony with the
other two existing orders, which would appear to have been the principal
object of its introduction.The keynote of Roman architecture was the
Corinthian order; and as, from the necessities of their tall,
many-storeyed buildings, the Romans were forced to use the three orders
together, often one over the other, it was indispensable that the three
should be reduced to something like harmony.This was accordingly done,
but at the expense of the Doric order, which, except when thus used in
combination, must be confessed to have very little claim to our
admiration.The Romans were much more unfortunate in their modifications of the
Ionic order than in those which they introduced into the Doric.They
never seem to have either liked or understood it, nor to have employed
it except as a _mezzo termine_ between the other two.In its own native
East this order had originally only been used in porticoes between piers
or _antæ_, where of course only one face was shown, and there were no
angles to be turned.When the Greeks adopted it they used it in temples
of Doric form, and in consequence were obliged to introduce a capital at
each angle, with two voluted faces in juxtaposition at right angles to
one another.In some instances—internally at least—as at Bassæ (Woodcut
No.142) they used a capital with four faces.The Romans, impatient of
control, eagerly seized on this modification, but never quite got over
the extreme difficulty of its employment.With them the angular volutes
became mere horns, and even in the best examples the capital wants
harmony and meaning.When used as a three-quarter column these alterations were not required,
and then the order resembled more its original form; but even in this
state it was never equal to the Greek examples, and gradually
deteriorated to the corrupt application of it in the Temple of Concord
in the Forum, which is the most degenerate example of the order now to
be found in Roman remains.The fate of this order in the hands of the Romans was different from
that of the other two.The Doric and Ionic orders had reached their acme
of perfection in the hands of the Grecian artists, and seem to have
become incapable of further improvement.The Corinthian, on the
contrary, was a recent conception; and although nothing can surpass the
elegance and grace with which the Greeks adorned it, the new capital
never acquired with them that fulness and strength so requisite to
render it an appropriate architectural ornament.These were added to it
by the Romans, or rather perhaps by Grecian artists acting under their
direction, who thus, as shown in Woodcut No.181, produced an order
which for richness combined with proportion and architectural fitness
has hardly been surpassed.The base is elegant and appropriate; the
shaft is of the most pleasing proportion, and the fluting gives it just
the requisite degree of richness and no more; while the capital, though
bordering on over-ornamentation, is so well arranged as to appear just
suited to the work it has to do.The acanthus-leaves, it is true,
approach the very verge of that degree of direct imitation of nature
which, though allowable in architectural ornaments, is seldom advisable;
they are, however, disposed so formally, and there still remains so much
that is conventional in them, that, though perhaps not justly open to
criticism on this account, they are nevertheless a very extreme example.The entablature is not so admirable as the column.The architrave is too
richly carved.It is evident, however, that this arose from the artist
having copied in carving what the Greeks had only painted, and thereby
produced a complexity far from pleasing.The frieze, as we now find it, is perfectly plain; but this undoubtedly
was not the case when originally erected.It either must have been
painted (in which case the whole order of course was also painted), or
ornamented with scrolls or figures in bronze, which may probably have
been gilt.The cornice is perhaps open to the same criticism as the architrave, of
being over-rich, though this evidently arose from the same cause, viz.,
reproducing in carving what was originally only painted; which to our
Northern eyes at least appears more appropriate for internal than for
external decoration, though, under the purer skies where it was
introduced and used, this remark may be hardly applicable.The order of the portico of the Pantheon is, according to our notions, a
nobler specimen of what an external pillar should be than that of the
Temple of Jupiter Stator.The shafts are of one block, unfluted; the
capital plainer; and the whole entablature, though as correctly
proportional, is far less ornamented and more suited to the greater
simplicity of the whole.The order of the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina is another example
intermediate between these two.The columns are in this instance very
similar to those of the Pantheon, and the architrave is plain.The
frieze, however, is ornamented with more taste than any other in Rome,
and is a very pleasing example of those conventional representations of
plants and animals which are so well suited to architectural
purposes—more like Nature than those of the Greeks, but still avoiding
direct imitation sufficiently to escape the affectation of pretending to
appear what it is not and cannot be.The Maison Carrée at Nîmes presents an example of a frieze ornamented
with exquisite taste, while at Baalbec, and in some other examples, we
have them so over-ornamented that the effect is far more offensive, from
utter want of repose, than the frieze in the Temple of Jupiter Stator
ever could be from its baldness.Besides these there are at least fifty varieties of Corinthian capitals
to be found, either in Rome or in various parts of the Roman Empire, all
executed within the three centuries during which Rome continued to be
the imperial city.Some of them are remarkable for that elegant
simplicity which so evidently betrays the hand of a Grecian artist,
while others again show a lavish exuberance of ornament which is but too
characteristic of Roman art in general.Many, however, contain the germs
of something better than was accomplished in that age; and a collection
of them would afford more useful suggestions for designing capitals than
have yet been available to modern artists.Among their various attempts to improve the order which has just been
described, the Romans hit upon one which is extremely characteristic of
their whole style of art.This is known by the distinguishing name of
the Composite order, though virtually more like the typical examples of
the Corinthian order than many of those classed under the latter
denomination.The greatest defect of the Corinthian capital is the weakness of the
small volutes supporting the angles of the abacus.A true artist would
have remedied this by adding to their strength and carrying up the
fulness of the capital to the top.The Romans removed the whole of the
upper part and substituted an Ionic capital instead.Their only original
idea, if it may be so called, in art was that of putting two dissimilar
things together to make one which should combine the beauties of both,
though as a rule the one generally serves to destroy the other.In the
Composite capital they never could hide the junction; and consequently,
though rich, and in some respects an improvement on the order out of
which it grew, this capital never came into general use, and has seldom
found favour except amongst the blindest admirers of all that the Romans
did.Corinthian Base, found in Church of St.In the latter days of the Empire the Romans attempted another innovation
which promised far better success, and with very little more elaboration
would have been a great gain to the principles of architectural design.This was the introduction of the Persian or Assyrian base, modified to
suit the details of the Corinthian or Composite orders.If they had
always used this instead of the square pedestals on which they mounted
their columns, and had attenuated the pillars slightly when used with
arcades, they would have avoided many of the errors they fell into.This
application, however, came too late to be generally used; and the forms
already introduced continued to prevail.At the same time it is evident
that a Persepolitan base for an Ionic and even for a Corinthian column
would be amongst the greatest improvements that could now be introduced,
especially for internal architecture.The true Roman order, however, was not any of these columnar ordinances
we have been enumerating, but an arrangement of two pillars placed at a
distance from one another nearly equal to their own height, and having a
very long entablature, which in consequence required to be supported in
the centre by an arch springing from piers.This, as will be seen from
the annexed woodcut, was in fact merely a screen of Grecian architecture
placed in front of a construction of Etruscan design.Though not without
a certain richness of effect, still, as used by the Romans, these two
systems remain too distinctly dissimilar for the result to be pleasing,
and their use necessitated certain supplemental arrangements by no means
agreeable.In the first place, the columns had to be mounted on
pedestals, or otherwise an entablature proportional to their size would
have been too heavy and too important for a thing so useless and so
avowedly a mere ornament.A projecting keystone was also introduced into
the arch.This was unobjectionable in itself, but when projecting so far
as to do the duty of an intermediate capital, it overpowered the arch
without being equal to the work required of it.The Romans used these arcades with all the 3 orders, frequently one over
the other, and tried various expedients to harmonise the construction
with the ornamentation, but without much effect.They seem always to
have felt the discordance as a blemish, and at last got rid of it, but
whether they did so in the best way is not quite clear.The most obvious
mode of effecting this would no doubt have been by omitting the pillars
altogether, bending the architrave, as is usually done, round the arch,
and then inserting the frieze and cornices into the wall, using them as
a string-course.A slight degree of practice would soon have enabled
them—by panelling the pier, cutting off its angles, or some such
expedient—to have obtained the degree of lightness or of ornament they
required, and so really to have invented a new order.This, however, was not the course that the Romans pursued.What they did
was to remove the pier altogether, and to substitute for it the pillar
taken down from its pedestal.This of course was not effected at once,
but was the result of many trials and expedients.One of the earliest of
these is observed in the Ionic Temple of Concord before alluded to, in
which a concealed arch is thrown from the head of each pillar, but above
the entablature, so as to take the whole weight of the superstructure
from off the cornice between the pillars.When once this was done it was
perceived that so deep an entablature was no longer required, and that
it might be either wholly omitted, as was sometimes done in the centre
intercolumniation, or very much reduced.There is an old temple at
Talavera in Spain, which is a good example of the former expedient; and
the Roman gateway at Damascus is a remarkable instance of the latter.There the architrave, frieze and cornice are carried across in the form
of an arch from pier to pier, thus constituting a new feature in
architectural design.View in Courtyard of Palace at Spalato]

In Diocletian’s reign we find all these changes already introduced into
domestic architecture, as shown in Woodcut No.185, representing the
great court of his palace at Spalato, where, at one end, the entablature
is bent into the form of an arch over the central intercolumniation,
while on each side of the court the arches spring directly from the
capitals of the columns.Had the Romans at this period been more desirous to improve their
external architecture, there is little doubt that they would have
adopted the expedient of omitting the entire entablature: but at this
time almost all their efforts were devoted to internal improvement, and
not unfrequently at the expense of the exterior.Indeed the whole
history of Roman art, from the time of Augustus to that of Constantine,
is a transition from the external architecture of the Greeks to the
internal embellishment of the Christians.At first we see the cells of
the temple gradually enlarged at the expense of the peristyle, and
finally, in some instances, entirely overpowering them.Their basilicas
and halls become more important than their porticoes, and the exterior
is in almost every instance sacrificed to internal arrangements.For an
interior, an arch resting on a circular column is obviously far more
appropriate than one resting on a pier.Externally, on the contrary, the
square pier is most suitable, because a pillar cannot support a wall of
sufficient thickness.This defect was not remedied until the Gothic
architects devised the plan of coupling two or more pillars together;
but this point had not been reached at the time when with the fall of
Rome all progress in art was effectually checked for a time.There is perhaps nothing that strikes the inquirer into the
architectural history of Rome more than the extreme insignificance of
her temples, as compared with the other buildings of the imperial city
and with some contemporary temples found in the provinces.The only
temple which remains at all worthy of such a capital is the Pantheon.All others are now mere fragments, from which we can with difficulty
restore even the plans of the buildings, far less judge of their effect.We have now no means of forming an opinion of the great national temple
of the Capitoline Jove, no trace of it, nor any intelligible
description, having been preserved to the present time.Its having been
of Etruscan origin, and retaining its original form to the latest day,
would lead us to suppose that the temple itself was small, and that its
magnificence, if any, was confined to the enclosure and to the
substructure, which may have been immense.Of the Augustan age we have nothing but the remains of three temples,
each consisting of only three columns; and the excavations that have
been made around them have not sufficed to make even their plans
tolerably clear.The most remarkable was that of Jupiter Stator in the Forum, the
beautiful details of which have been already alluded to and described.It was raised on a stylobate 22 ft.in height, the extreme width of which was 98 ft., and this corresponds
as closely as possible with 100 Roman ft.The height of the pillars was 48 ft., and
that of the entablature 12 ft.[165] It is probable that the whole
height to the apex of the pediment was nearly equal to the extreme
width, and that it was designed to be so.The pillars certainly extended on both flanks, and the temple is
generally restored as peristylar, but apparently without any authority.From the analogy of the other temples it seems more probable that there
were not more than eight or ten pillars on each side, and that the apse
of the cella formed the termination opposite the portico.The temple nearest to this in situation and style is that of Jupiter
Tonans.[166] The order in this instance is of slightly inferior
dimensions to that of the temple just described, and of very inferior
execution.The temple, too, was very much smaller, having only six
columns in front, and from its situation it could not well have had more
than that number on the flanks, so that its extreme dimensions were
probably about 70 ft.The third is the Temple of Mars Ultor, of which a plan is annexed; for
though now as completely decayed as the other two, in the time of Ant.Sabacco and Palladio there seem to have been sufficient remains to
justify an attempt at restoration.As will be seen, it is nearly square
in plan (112 ft.The cella is here a much more important part
than is usual in Greek temples, and terminates in an apse, which
afterwards became characteristic of all places of worship.Behind the
cella, and on each side, was a lofty screen of walls and arches, part of
which still remain, and form quite a new adjunct, unlike anything
hitherto met with attached to any temple now known.(From Cresy’s ‘Rome.’) Scale
100 ft.The next class of temples, called pseudo-peripteral (or those in which
the cella occupies the whole of the after part), are generally more
modern, certainly more completely Roman, than these last.One of the
best specimens at Rome is the Temple of Antoninus and Faustina, a small
building measuring 72 ft.There is also a very elegant little
Ionic temple of this class called that of Fortuna Virilis; while the
Ionic Temple of Concord, built by Vespasian, and above alluded to,
appears also to have been of this class.So was the temple in the forum
at Pompeii; but the finest specimen now remaining to us is the so-called
Maison Carrée at Nîmes, which is indeed one of the most elegant temples
of the Roman world, owing probably a great deal of its beauty to the
taste of the Grecian colonists long settled in its neighbourhood.It is
hexastyle, with 11 columns in the flanks, 3 of which stand free, and
belong to the portico; the remaining 8 are attached to the walls of the
cella.by 85; but such is the beauty of
its proportions and the elegance of its details that it strikes every
beholder with admiration.Plan of Maison Carrée at Nîmes.The date of this temple has not been satisfactorily ascertained.From
the nail-holes of the inscription on the frieze it has been attempted to
make out the names of Caius and Lucius Cæsar, and there is nothing in
the style of its architecture to contradict this hypothesis.Even if the
buildings in the capital were such as to render this date ambiguous, it
would scarcely be safe to apply any argument derived from them to a
provincial example erected in the midst of a Grecian colony.But for
their evidence we might almost be inclined to fancy its style
represented the age of Trajan.The temple of Diana in the same city is another edifice of singular
beauty of detail, and interesting from the peculiarity of its plan.Exclusive of the portico it is nearly square, 70 ft.by 65, and consists
of a cella which is covered with a stone ribbed vault, the thrust of
which is counteracted by smaller vaults thrown across two side passages
or aisles which are, however, not thrown open to the cella.The columns
in the cella are detached from the wall, which is singularly interesting
as the origin of much which we find afterwards in Gothic work.(A
somewhat similar arrangement is found in the small temple at Baalbec
(Woodcut No.197) where, however, the peristyle occupies the position
and serves the same purpose as the aisles at Nîmes, viz., to resist the
thrust of the vault over the cella.)Plan of Temple of Diana at Nîmes.Throughout this building the details of the architecture are unsurpassed
for variety and elegance by anything found in the metropolis, and are
applied here with a freedom and elegance bespeaking the presence of a
Grecian mind even in this remote corner of the Empire.This was supported by four slender
columns of singularly elegant design, but placed so widely apart that
they could not have carried a stone entablature.It is difficult to
guess what could have been the form of the wooden ones; but a mortice
which still exists in the walls of the temple shows that it must have
been eight or ten feet deep, and therefore probably of Etruscan form
(Woodcut No.167); though it may have assumed a circular arched form
between the pillars.[167]

[Illustration: 189.View of the Interior of the Temple of Diana at
Nîmes.Another peculiarity is, that the light was introduced over the portico
by a great semicircular window, as is done in the Buddhist caves in
India; which, so far as I know, is the most perfect mode of lighting the
interior of a temple which has yet been discovered.Not far from the Colosseum, in the direction of the Forum, are still to
be seen the remains of a great double temple built by the Emperor
Hadrian, and dedicated to Venus and Rome, and consisting of the ruins of
its two cells, each about 70 ft.square, covered with tunnel-vaults, and
placed back to back, so that their apses touch one another.long by 330 wide; and it is generally supposed
that on the edge of this once stood 56 great columns, 65 ft.in height,
thus moulding the whole into one great peripteral temple.Some fragments
of such pillars are said to be found in the neighbourhood, but not one
is now erect,—not even a base is in its place,—nor can any of its
columns be traced to any other buildings.This part, therefore, of the
arrangement is very problematical, and I should be rather inclined to
restore it, as Palladio and the older architects have done, with a
corridor of ten small columns in front of each of the cells.If we could
assume the plan of this temple to have been really peripteral, as
supposed, it must have been a building worthy of the imperial city and
of the magnificence of the emperor to whom its erection is ascribed.More perfect and more interesting than any of these is the Pantheon,
which is undoubtedly one of the finest temples of the ancient world.Externally its effect is very much destroyed by its two parts, the
circular and the rectangular, being so dissimilar in style and so
incongruously joined together.The portico especially, in itself the
finest which Rome exhibits, is very much injured by being prefixed to a
mass which overpowers it and does not harmonise with any of its lines.The pitch, too, of its pediment is perhaps somewhat too high, but,
notwithstanding all this, its sixteen columns, the shaft of each
composed of a single block, and the simple grandeur of the details,
render it perhaps the most satisfactory example of its class.The pillars are arranged in the Etruscan fashion, as they were
originally disposed in front of three-celled temples.As they now stand,
however, they are added unsymmetrically to a rotunda, and in so clumsy a
fashion that the two are certainly not part of the same design and do
not belong to the same age.Either it was that the portico was added to
the pre-existing rotunda, or that the rotunda is long subsequent to the
portico.Unfortunately the two inscriptions on the portico hardly help
to a solution of the difficulty.The principal one states that it was
built by M. Agrippa, but the “it” may refer to the rotunda only, and may
have been put there by those who in the time of Aurelius[168] repaired
the temple which had “fallen into decay from age.” This hardly could,
under any circumstances, be predicated of the rotunda, which shows no
sign of decay during the last seventeen centuries of ill-treatment and
neglect, and may last for as many more without injury to its stability,
but might be said of a portico which, if of wood, as Etruscan porticoes
usually were, may easily in 200 years have required repairs and
rebuilding.From a more careful examination on the spot, I am convinced
that the portico was added at some subsequent period to the rotunda.If
by Agrippa, then the dome must belong to Republican times; if by Severus
it may have been, as is generally supposed, the hall of the Baths of
Agrippa.[169] Altogether I know of no building whose date and
arrangements are so singular and so exceptional as this.Though it is,
and always must have been, one of the most prominent buildings in Rome,
and most important from its size and design, I know of no other building
in Rome whose date or original destination it is so difficult to
determine.Half Elevation, half Section, of the Pantheon at
Rome.Internally perhaps the greatest defect of the building is a want of
height in the perpendicular part, which the dome appears to overpower
and crush.This mistake is aggravated by the lower part being cut up
into two storeys, an attic being placed over the lower order.The former
defect may have arisen from the architect wishing to keep the walls in
some proportion to the portico.The latter is a peculiarity of the age
in which I suppose this temple to have been remodelled, when two or more
storeys seem to have become indispensable requisites of architectural
design.We must ascribe also to the practice of the age the method of
cutting through the entablature by the arches of the great niches, as
shown in the sectional part of the last woodcut.It has already been
pointed out that this was becoming a characteristic of the style at the
time when the circular part of this temple was arranged as it at present
appears.Notwithstanding these defects and many others of detail that might be
mentioned, there is a grandeur and a simplicity in the proportions of
this great temple that render it still one of the very finest and most
sublime interiors in the world, and the dimensions of its dome, 145 ft.span by 147 in height, have not yet been surpassed by any
subsequent erection.Though it is deprived of its bronze covering[170]
and of the greater part of those ornaments on which it mainly depended
for effect, and though these have been replaced by tawdry and
incongruous modernisms, still nothing can destroy the effect of a design
so vast and of a form so simply grand.It possesses moreover one other
element of architectural sublimity in having a single window, and that
placed high up in the building.I know of no other temples which possess
this feature except the great rock-cut Buddhist basilicas of India.In
them the light is introduced even more artistically than here; but,
nevertheless, that one great eye opening upon heaven is by far the
noblest conception for lighting a building to be found in Europe.Besides this great rotunda there are two other circular temples in or
near Rome.The one at Tivoli, shown in plan and elevation in the annexed
woodcuts (Nos.192 and 193), has long been known and admired; the other,
near the mouth of the Cloaca Maxima, has a cell surrounded by twenty
Corinthian columns of singularly slender proportions.Both these
probably stand on Etruscan sites; they certainly are Etruscan in form,
and are very likely sacred to Pelasgic deities, either Vesta or Cybele.Restored Elevation of Temple at Tivoli.Both in dimensions and design they form a perfect contrast to the
Pantheon, as might be expected from their both belonging to the Augustan
age of art: consequently the cella is small, its interior is
unornamented, and all the art and expense is lavished on the external
features, especially on the peristyle; showing more strongly than even
the rectangular temple the still remaining predominance of Grecian
taste, which was gradually dying out during the whole period of the
Empire.It is to be regretted that the exact dates of both these temples are
unknown, for, as that at Tivoli shows the stoutest example of a
Corinthian column known and that in Rome the slenderest, it might lead
to some important deductions if we could be certain which was the older
of the two.It may be, however, that this difference of style has no
connection with the relative age of the two buildings, but that it is
merely an instance of the good taste of the age to which they belong.The Roman example, being placed in a low and flat situation, required
all the height that could be given it; that at Tivoli, being placed on
the edge of a rock, required as much solidity as the order would admit
of to prevent its looking poor and insecure.A Gothic or a Greek
architect would certainly have made this distinction.One more step towards the modern style of round temples was taken before
the fall of the Western Empire, in the temple which Diocletian built in
his palace at Spalato.Internally the temple is circular, 28 ft.in
diameter, and the height of the perpendicular part to the springing of
the dome is about equal to its width.This is a much more pleasing
proportion than we find in the Pantheon; perhaps the very best that has
yet been employed.Externally the building is an octagon, surrounded by
a low dwarf peristyle, very unlike that employed in the older examples.This angularity is certainly a great improvement, giving expression and
character to the building, and affording flat faces for the entrances or
porches; but the peristyle is too low, and mars the dignity of the
whole.[171]

[Illustration: 194.Plan and Elevation of Temple in Diocletian’s Palace
at Spalato.To us its principal interest consists in its being so extremely similar
to the Christian baptisteries which were erected in the following
centuries, and which were copies, but very slightly altered, from
buildings of this class.Even assuming that Hadrian completed the great Temple of Venus at Rome
in the manner generally supposed, it must have been very far surpassed
by the great Temple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens, which, though
probably not entirely erected, was certainly finished, by that Emperor.It was octastyle in front,[172] with a double range of 20 columns on
each flank so that it could not well have had less than 106 columns, all
about 58 ft.in height, and of the most elegant Corinthian order,
presenting altogether a group of far greater magnificence than any other
temple we are acquainted with of its class in the ancient world.Its
lineal dimensions also, as may be seen from the plan (Woodcut No.195),
were only rivalled by the two great Sicilian temples at Selinus and
Agrigentum (Woodcuts Nos.wide by 354 in
length, or nearly the same dimensions as the great Hypostyle Hall at
Karnac, from which, however, it differs most materially, that being a
beautiful example of an interior, this depending for all its
magnificence on the external arrangement of its columns.Penrose’s
discoveries in 1884 show that there was an opisthodomus at the rear and
a vestibule or court in front of the cella which may have been hypæthral
so as to admit light into the interior.This arrangement became so
common in the early Christian world that there must have been some
precedent for it; which, in addition to other reasons,[173] strongly
inclines me to believe that the arrangement shown in the plan is
correct.Ruins of the Temple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens.]Plan of Temple of Jupiter Olympius at Athens.]The temples of Palmyra and Kangovar have been already mentioned in
speaking of that of Jerusalem, to which class they seem to belong in
their general arrangements, though their details are borrowed from Roman
architecture.This, however, is not the case with the temples at
Baalbec, which taken together and with their accompaniments, form the
most magnificent temple group now left to us of their class and age.The
great temple, if completed (which, however, probably it never was),
would have been about 160 ft.by 290, and therefore, as a Corinthian
temple, only inferior to that of Jupiter Olympius at Athens.Only nine
of its colossal columns are now standing, but the bases of most of the
others are _in situ_.Scarcely less magnificent than the temple itself
was the court in which it stood, above 380 ft.square, and surrounded on
three sides by recessed porticoes of most exuberant richness, though in
perhaps rather questionable taste.In front of this was a hexagonal
court of very great beauty, with a noble portico of 12 Corinthian
columns, with two square blocks of masonry at each end.The whole extent
of the portico is 260 ft., and of its kind it is perhaps unrivalled,
certainly among the buildings of so late a date as the period to which
it belongs.Elevation of Small Temple at Baalbec.The other, or smaller temple, stands close to the larger.Its
dimensions, to the usual scale, are shown in the plan (Woodcut No.It is larger than any of the Roman peripteral temples, being 117 ft.by
227 ft., or rather exceeding the dimensions of the Parthenon at Athens,
and its portico is both wider and higher than that of the Pantheon at
Rome.Had this portico been applied to that building, the <DW72> of its
pediment would have coincided exactly with that of the upper sloping
cornice, and would have been the greatest possible improvement to that
edifice.As it is, it certainly is the best proportioned and the most
graceful Roman portico of the first class that remains to us in a state
of sufficient completeness to allow us to judge of its effect.The interior of the cella was richly ornamented with niches and
pilasters, and covered with a ribbed and coffered vault, remarkable,
like every part of this edifice, rather for the profusion than for the
good taste of its ornaments.One of the principal peculiarities of this group of buildings is the
immense size of some of the stones used in the substructure of the great
temple: three of these average about 63 ft.A fourth, of similar dimensions, is lying
in the quarry, which it is calculated must weigh alone more than 1100
tons in its rough state, or nearly as much as one of the tubes of the
Britannia Bridge.It is not easy to see why such masses were employed.If they had been used as foundation stones their use would have been
apparent, but they are placed over several courses of smaller stones,
about half-way up the terrace wall, as mere binding stones, apparently
for show.It is true that in many places in the Bible and in Josephus
nothing is so much insisted upon as the immense size of the stones used
in the building of the Temple and the walls of Jerusalem, the bulk of
the materials used appearing to have been thought a matter of far more
importance than the architecture.It probably was some such feeling as
this which led to their employment here, though, had these huge stones
been set upright, as the Egyptians would have placed them, we might more
easily have understood why so great an expense should have been incurred
on their account.As it is, there seems no reason for doubting their
being of the same age as the temples they support, though their use is
certainly exceptional in Roman temples of this class.BASILICAS, THEATRES, AND BATHS.Basilicas of Trajan and Maxentius—Provincial basilicas—Theatre at
  Orange—Colosseum—Provincial amphitheatres—Baths of Diocletian.We have already seen that in size and magnificence the temples of Rome
were among the least remarkable of her public buildings.It may be
doubted whether in any respect, in the eyes of the Romans themselves,
the temples were as important and venerable as the basilicas.The people
cared for government and justice more than for religion, and
consequently paid more attention to the affairs of the basilicas than to
those of the temples.Our means for the restoration of this class of
buildings are now but small, owing to their slight construction in the
first instance, and to their materials having been so suitable for the
building of Christian basilicas as to have been extensively used for
that purpose.It happens, however, that the remains which we do possess
comprise what we know to be the ruins of the two most splendid buildings
of this class in Rome, and these are sufficiently complete to enable us
to restore their plans with considerable confidence.It is also
fortunate that one of these, the Ulpian or Trajan’s basilica, is the
typical specimen of those with wooden roofs; the other, that of
Maxentius, commonly called the Temple of Peace, is the noblest of the
vaulted class.Plan of Trajan’s Basilica at Rome.The part shaded darker is all that is uncovered.
]Restored Section of Trajan’s Basilica.The rectangular part of Trajan’s basilica was 180 ft.in width and a
little more than twice that in length, but, neither end having yet been
excavated, its exact longitudinal measurement has not been ascertained.It was divided into five aisles by four rows of columns, each about 35
ft.wide, and the side-aisles 23 ft.The centre was covered by a wooden roof of semicircular
form,[174] covered apparently with bronze plates richly ornamented and
gilt.Above the side aisles was a gallery, the roof of which was
supported by an upper row of columns.From the same columns also sprang
the arches of the great central aisle.The total internal height was
thus probably about 120 ft., or higher than any English cathedral,
though not so high as some German and French churches.At one end was a great semicircular apse, the back part of which was
raised, being approached by a semicircular range of steps.In the centre
of this platform was the raised seat of the quæstor or other magistrate
who presided.On each side, upon the steps, were places for the
assessors or others engaged in the business being transacted.In front
of the apse was placed an altar, where sacrifice was performed before
commencing any important public business.[175]

Externally this basilica could not have been of much magnificence.It
was entered on the side of the Forum (on the left hand of the plan and
section) by one triple doorway in the centre and two single ones on
either side, flanked by shallow porticoes of columns of the same height
as those used internally.These supported statues, or rather, to judge
from the coins representing the building, rilievos, which may have set
off, but could hardly have given much dignity to, a building designed as
this was.At the end opposite the apse a similar arrangement seems to
have prevailed.This mode of using columns only half the height of the edifice must have
been very destructive of their effect and of the general grandeur of the
structure, but it became about this time rather the rule than the
exception, and was afterwards adopted for temples and every other class
of buildings, so that it was decidedly an improvement when the arch took
the place of the horizontal architrave and cornice; the latter always
suggested a roof, and became singularly incongruous when applied as a
mere ornamental adjunct at half the height of the façade.The interior
of the basilica was, however, the important element to which the
exterior was entirely sacrificed, a transition in architectural design
which we have before alluded to, taking place much faster in basilicas,
which were an entirely new form of building, than in temples, whose
conformation had become sacred from the traditions of past ages.Longitudinal Section of Basilica of Maxentius.Transverse Section of Basilica of Maxentius.The basilica of Maxentius, which was probably not entirely finished till
the reign of Constantine, was rather broader than that of Trajan, being
195 ft.between the walls, but it was 100 ft.The
central aisle was very nearly of the same width, being 83 ft.There was, however, a vast difference
in the construction of the two; so much so, that we are startled to see
how rapid the progress had been during the interval, of less than two
centuries, that had elapsed between the construction of the two
basilicas.Pillar of Maxentian Basilica.(From an old print
quoted by Letarouilly.)]In this building no pillars were used with the exception of eight great
columns in front of the piers, employed merely as ornaments, or as
vaulting shafts were in Gothic cathedrals, to support in appearance,
though not in construction, the springing of the vaults.[176] The
side-aisles were roofed by three great arches, each 74 ft.in span, and
the centre by an immense intersecting vault in three compartments.The
form of these will be understood from the annexed sections (Woodcuts
Nos.202 and 203), one taken longitudinally, the other across the
building.As will be seen from them, all the thrusts are collected to a
point and a buttress placed there to receive them: indeed almost all the
peculiarities afterwards found in Gothic vaults are here employed on a
far grander and more gigantic scale than the Gothic architects ever
attempted; but at the same time it must be allowed that the latter, with
smaller dimensions, often contrived by a more artistic treatment of
their materials to obtain as grand an effect and far more actual beauty
than ever were attained in the great transitional halls of the Romans.The largeness of the parts of the Roman buildings was indeed their
principal defect, as in consequence of this they must all have appeared
smaller than they really were, whereas in all Gothic cathedrals the
repetition and smallness of the component parts has the effect of
magnifying their real dimensions.The roofs of these halls had one peculiarity which it would have been
well if the mediæval architects had copied, inasmuch as they were all,
or at least might have been, honestly used as roofs without any
necessity for their being covered with others of wood, as all Gothic
vaults unfortunately were.It is true this is perhaps one of the causes
of their destruction, for, being only overlaid with cement, the rain
wore away the surface, as must inevitably be the case with any
composition of the sort exposed horizontally to the weather, and that
being gone, the moisture soon penetrated through the crevices of the
masonry, destroying the stability of the vault.Still, some of these in
Rome have resisted for fifteen centuries, after the removal of any
covering they ever might have had, all the accidents of climate and
decay, while there is not a Gothic vault of half their dimensions that
would stand for a century after the removal of its wooden protection.The construction of a vault capable of resisting the destructive effects
of exposure to the atmosphere still remains a problem for modern
architects to solve.Until this is accomplished we must regard roofs
entirely of honest wood as preferable to the deceptive stone ceilings
which were such favourites in the Middle Ages.Plan of the Basilica at Trèves.Internal View of the Basilica at Trèves.]The provincial basilicas of the Roman Empire have nearly all perished,
probably from their having been converted, first into churches, for
which they were so admirably adapted, and then rebuilt to suit the
exigencies and taste of subsequent ages.One example, however, still
exists in Trèves of sufficient completeness to give a good idea of what
such structures were.As will be seen by the annexed plan, it consists
of a great hall, 85 ft.in width internally, and rather more than twice
that dimension in length.in height and
pierced with two rows of windows; but whether they were originally
separated by a gallery or not is now by no means clear.At one end was
the apse, rather more than a semicircle of 60 ft.The floor
of the apse was raised considerably above that of the body of the
building, and was no doubt adorned by a hemicycle of seats raised on
steps, with a throne in the centre for the judge.The building has been
used for so many purposes since the time of the Romans, and has been so
much altered, that it is not easy now to speak with certainty of any of
its minor arrangements.Its internal and external appearance, as it
stood before the recent restoration, are well expressed in the annexed
woodcuts; and though ruined, it was the most complete example of a Roman
basilica to be found anywhere out of the capital.A building of this
description has been found at Pompeii, which may be considered a fair
example of a provincial basilica of the second class.Its plan is
perfectly preserved, as shown in Woodcut No.The most striking
difference existing between it and those previously described is the
square termination instead of the circular apse.It must, however, be
observed that Pompeii was situated nearer to Magna Græcia than to Rome,
and was indeed far more a Greek than a Roman city.Very slight traces of
any Etruscan designs have been discovered there, and scarcely any
buildings of the circular form so much in vogue in the capital.Though
the ground-plan of this basilica remains perfect, the upper parts are
entirely destroyed, and we do not even know for certain whether the
central portion was roofed or not.[177]

[Illustration: 207.External View of the Basilica at Trèves.]There is a small square building at Otricoli, which is generally
supposed to be a basilica, but its object as well as its age is so
uncertain that nothing need be said of it here.In the works of
Vitruvius, too, there is a description of one built by him at Fano, the
restoration of which has afforded employment for the ingenuity of the
admirers of that worst of architects.Even taking it as restored by
those most desirous of making the best of it, it is difficult to
understand how anything so bad could have been erected in such an age.It is extremely difficult to trace the origin of these basilicas, owing
principally to the loss of all the earlier examples.Their name is
Greek, and they may probably be considered as derived from the Grecian
Lesche, or perhaps as amplifications of the cellæ of Greek temples,
appropriated to the purposes of justice rather than of religion; but
till we know more of their earlier form and origin, it is useless
speculating on this point.The greatest interest to us, arises rather
from the use to which their plan was afterwards applied, than from the
source from which they themselves sprang.All the larger Christian
churches in the early times were copies, more or less exact, of the
basilicas of which that of Trajan is an example.The abundance of
pillars, suitable to such an erection, that were found everywhere in
Rome, rendered their construction easy and cheap; and the wooden roof
with which they were covered was also as simple and as inexpensive a
covering as could well be designed.The very uses of the Christian
basilicas at first were by no means dissimilar to those of their heathen
originals, as they were in reality the assembly halls of the early
Christian republic, before they became liturgical churches of the
Catholic hierarchy.The more expensive construction of the bold vaults of the Maxentian
basilica went far beyond the means of the early Church, established in a
declining and abandoned capital, and this form therefore remained
dormant for seven or eight centuries before it was revived by the
mediæval architects on an infinitely smaller scale, but adorned with a
degree of appropriateness and taste to which the Romans were strangers.It was then used with a completeness and unity which entitle it to be
considered as an entirely new style of architecture.The theatre was by no means so essential a part of the economy of a
Roman city as it was of a Grecian one.With the latter it was quite as
indispensable as the temple; and in the semi-Greek city of Herculaneum
there was one, and in Pompeii two, on a scale quite equal to those of
Greece when compared with the importance of the town itself.In the
capital there appears only to have been one, that of Marcellus,[178]
built during the reign of Augustus.It it is very questionable whether
what we now see—especially the outer arcades—belong to that age, or
whether the theatre may not have been rebuilt and these arcades added at
some later period.It is so completely built over by modern houses, and
so ruined, that it is extremely difficult to arrive at any satisfactory
opinion regarding it.Its dimensions were worthy of the capital, the
audience part being a semicircle of 410 ft.in diameter, and the scena
being of great extent in proportion to the other part, which is a
characteristic of all Roman theatres, as compared with Grecian edifices
of this class.One of the most striking Roman provincial theatres is that of Orange, in
the south of France.Perhaps it owes its existence, or at all events its
splendour, to the substratum of Grecian colonists that preceded the
Romans in that country.in diameter, but much
ruined, in consequence of the Princes of Orange having used this part as
a bastion in some fortification they were constructing.It shows well the increased
extent and complication of arrangements required for the theatrical
representations of the age in which it was constructed, being a
considerable advance towards the more modern idea of a play, as
distinguished from the stately semi-religious spectacle in which the
Greeks delighted.The noblest part of the building is the great wall at
the back, an immense mass of masonry 340 ft.in
height, without a single opening above the basement, and no ornament
except a range of blank arches, about midway between the basement and
the top, and a few projecting corbels to receive the footings of the
masts that supported the velarium.Nowhere does the architecture of the
Romans shine so much as when their gigantic buildings are left to tell
their own tale by the imposing grandeur of their masses.Whenever
ornament is attempted, their bad taste comes out.The size of their
edifices, and the solidity of their construction, were only surpassed by
the Egyptians, and not always by them; and when, as here, the mass of
material heaped up stands unadorned in all its native grandeur,
criticism is disarmed, and the spectator stands awe-struck at its
majesty, and turns away convinced that truly “there were giants in those
days.” This is not, it is true, the most intellectual way of obtaining
architectural effect, but it has the advantage of being the easiest, the
most certain to secure the desired result, and at the same time the most
permanent.The deficiency of theatres erected by the Romans is far more than
compensated by the number and splendour of their amphitheatres, which,
with their baths, may be considered as the true types of Roman art,
although it is possible that they derived this class of public buildings
from the Etruscans.At Sutrium there is a very noble one cut out of the
tufa rock,[179] which was no doubt used by that people for festal
representations long before Rome attempted anything of the kind.It is
uncertain whether gladiatorial fights or combats of wild beasts formed
any part of the amusements of the arena in those days, though boxing,
wrestling, and contests of that description certainly did; but whether
the Etruscans actually proceeded to the shedding of blood and to
slaughter is more than doubtful.Even in the remotest parts of Britain, in Germany and Gaul, wherever we
find a Roman settlement, we find the traces of their amphitheatres.Their soldiery, it seems, could not exist without the enjoyment of
seeing men engaged in doubtful and mortal combats—either killing one
another, or torn to pieces by wild beasts.It is not to be wondered at
that a people who delighted so much in the bloody scenes of the arena
should feel but very little pleasure in the mimic sorrows and tame
humour of the stage.The brutal exhibition of the amphitheatre fitted
them, it is true, to be a nation of conquerors, and gave them the empire
of the world, but it brought with it feelings singularly inimical to all
the softer arts, and was perhaps the great cause of their ultimate
debasement.Elevation and Section of part of the Flavian
Amphitheatre at Rome.Quarter-plan of the Seats and quarter-plan of the
Basement of the Flavian Amphitheatre.As might be expected, the largest and most splendid of these buildings
is that which adorns the capital; and of all the ruins which Rome
contains, none have excited such universal admiration as the Flavian
Amphitheatre.Poets, painters, rhapsodists, have exhausted all the
resources of their arts in the attempt to convey to others the
overpowering impression this building produces on their own minds.With
the single exception, perhaps, of the Hall at Karnac, no ruin has met
with such universal admiration as this.Its association with the ancient
mistress of the world, its destruction, and the half-prophetic destiny
ascribed to it, all contribute to this.In spite of our better judgment
we are forced to confess that

                 “The gladiators’ bloody circus stands
                 A noble wreck in ruinous perfection,”

and worthy of all or nearly all the admiration of which it has been the
object.Its interior is almost wholly devoid of ornament, or anything
that can be called architecture—a vast inverted pyramid.The exterior
does not possess one detail which is not open to criticism, and indeed
to positive blame.Notwithstanding all this, its magnitude, its form,
and its associations, all combine to produce an effect against which the
critic struggles in vain.Still, all must admit that the pillars and
their entablature are useless and are added incongruously, and that the
upper storey, not being arched like the lower, but solid, and with ugly
pilasters, is a painful blemish.This last defect is so striking that,
in spite of the somewhat dubious evidence of medals, I should feel
inclined to suspect that it was a subsequent addition, and meant wholly
for the purpose of supporting and working the great velarium or awning
that covered the arena during the representation, which may not have
been attempted when the amphitheatre was first erected.Be this as it may, it certainly now very much mars the effect of the
building.The lower storeys are of bad design, but this is worse.But
notwithstanding these defects, there is no building of Rome where the
principle of reduplication of parts, of which the Gothic architects
afterwards made so much use, is carried to so great an extent as in
this.The Colosseum is principally indebted to this feature for the
effect which it produces.Had it, for instance, been designed with only
one storey of the height of the four now existing, and every arch had
consequently been as wide as the present four, the building would have
scarcely appeared half the size it is now seen to be.For all this,
however, when close under it, and comparing it with moving figures and
other objects, we could scarcely eventually fail to realise its
wonderful dimensions.In that case, a true sense of the vast size of the
building would have had to be acquired, as is the case with the façade
of St.Now it forces itself on the mind at the first glance.It
is the repetition of arch beyond arch and storey over storey that leads
the mind on, and gives to this amphitheatre its imposing grandeur, which
all acknowledge, though few give themselves the trouble to inquire how
this effect is produced.Fortunately, too, though the face of the building is much cut up by the
order, the entablatures are unbroken throughout, and cross the building
in long vanishing lines of the most graceful curvatures.The oval, also,
is certainly more favourable for effect than a circular form would be.A
building of this shape may perhaps look smaller than it really is to a
person standing exactly opposite either end; but in all other positions
the flatter side gives a variety and an appearance of size, which the
monotonous equality of a circle would never produce.The length of the building, measured over all along its greatest
diameter, is 620 ft., its breadth 513, or nearly in the ratio of 6 to 5,
which may be taken as the general proportion of these buildings, the
variations from it being slight, and apparently either mistakes in
setting out the work in ancient times, or in measuring it in modern
days, rather than an intentional deviation.The height of the three
lower storeys, or of what I believe to have been the original building,
is 120 ft.; the total height as it now stands is 157 ft.The whole area of
the building has been calculated to contain 250,000 square feet, of
which the arena contains 40,000; then deducting 10,000 for the external
wall, 200,000 square feet will remain available for the audience.If we
divide this by 5,[180] which is the number of square feet it has been
found necessary to allow for each spectator in modern places of
amusement, room will be afforded for 40,000 spectators; at 4 feet, which
is a possible quantity, with continuous seats and the scant drapery of
the Romans, the amphitheatre might contain 50,000 spectators at one
time.The area of the supports has also been calculated at about 40,000 square
feet, or about one-sixth of the whole area; which for an unroofed
edifice of this sort[181] is more than sufficient, though the excess
accounts for the stability of the building.Next in extent to this great metropolitan amphitheatre was that of
Capua; its dimensions were 558 ft.It had three storeys, designed similarly to those of the Colosseum, but
all of the Doric order, and used with more purity than in the Roman
example.Next in age, though not in size, is that at Nîmes, 430 ft.by 378, and
72 in height, in two storeys.Both these storeys are more profusely and
more elegantly ornamented with pillars than those of either of the
amphitheatres mentioned above.The entablature is however broken over
each column, and pediments are introduced on each front.All these
arrangements, though showing more care in design and sufficient elegance
in detail, make this building very inferior in grandeur to the two
earlier edifices, whose simplicity of outline makes up, to a great
extent, for their faults of detail.A more beautiful example than this is that at Verona.high, in three storeys beautifully
proportioned.Here the order almost entirely disappears to make way for
rustication, showing that it must be considerably more modern than
either of the three examples above quoted, though hardly so late as the
time of Maximianus, to whom it is frequently ascribed.[182] The arena of
this amphitheatre is very nearly perfect, owing to the care taken of it
during the Middle Ages, when it was often used for tournaments and other
spectacles; but of its outer architectural enclosure only four bays
remain, sufficient to enable an architect to restore the whole, but not
to allow of its effect being compared with that of more entire examples.The amphitheatre at Pola, which is of about the same age as that of
Verona, and certainly belonging to the last days of the Western Empire,
presents in its ruin a curious contrast to the other.That at Verona has
a perfect arena and only a fragment of its exterior decoration, while
the exterior of Pola is perfect, but not a trace remains of its arena,
or of the seats that surrounded it.This is probably owing to their
having been of wood, and consequently having either decayed or been
burnt.Like that at Verona, it presents all the features of the last
stage of transition; the order is still seen, or rather is everywhere
suggested, but so concealed and kept subordinate that it does not at all
interfere with the general effect.But for these faint traces we should
possess in this amphitheatre one specimen entirely emancipated from
incongruous Grecian forms, but, as before remarked, Rome perished when
just on the threshold of the new style.Elevation of the Amphitheatre at Verona.The dimensions of the amphitheatre at Pola are very nearly the same as
of that at Nîmes, being 436 ft.It has, however, three storeys,
and thus its height is considerably greater, being 97 ft.Owing to the
inequality of the ground on which it is built, the lower storey shows
the peculiarity of a sub-basement, which is very pleasingly managed, and
appears to emancipate it more from conventional forms than is the case
with its contemporary at Verona.The third storey, or attic, is also
more pleasing than elsewhere, as it is avowedly designed for the support
of the masts of the velarium.The pilasters and all Greek forms are
omitted, and there is only a groove over every column of the middle
storey to receive the masts.There is also a curious sort of open
battlement on the top, evidently designed to facilitate the working of
the awning, though in what manner is not quite clear.There is still one
other peculiarity about the building, the curvature of its lines is
broken by four projecting wings, intended apparently to contain
staircases; in a building so light and open as this one is in its
present state there can be no doubt but that the projections give
expression and character to the outline, though such additions would go
far to spoil any of the greater examples above quoted.At Otricoli there is a small amphitheatre, 312 ft.by 230, in two
storeys, from which the order has entirely disappeared; it is therefore
possibly the most modern of its class, but the great flat pilasters that
replace the pillars are ungraceful and somewhat clumsy.Perhaps its
peculiarities ought rather to be looked on as provincialisms than as
genuine specimens of an advanced style.Still there is a pleasing
simplicity about it that on a larger scale would enable it to stand
comparison with some of its greater rivals.Besides these, which are the typical examples of the style, there are
the “Castrense” at Rome, nearly circular, and possessing all the faults
and none of the beauties of the Colosseum; one at Arles, very much
ruined; and a great number of provincial ones, not only in Italy and
Gaul, but in Germany and Britain.Almost all these were principally if
not wholly excavated from the earth, the part above-ground being the
mound formed by the excavation.If they ever possessed any external
decoration to justify their being treated as architectural objects, it
has disappeared, so that in the state at least in which we now find them
they do not belong to the ornamental class of works of which we are at
present treating.Next in splendour to the amphitheatres of the Romans were their great
thermal establishments: in size they were perhaps even more remarkable,
and their erection must certainly have been more costly.The
amphitheatre, however, has the great advantage in an architectural point
of view of being one object, one hall in short, whereas the baths were
composed of a great number of smaller parts, not perhaps very
successfully grouped together.They were wholly built of brick covered
with stucco (except perhaps the pillars), and have, therefore, now so
completely lost their architectural features that it is with difficulty
that even the most practised architect can restore them to anything like
their original appearance.In speaking of the great Thermæ of Imperial Rome, they must not be
confounded with such establishments as that of Pompeii for instance.The
latter was very similar to the baths now found in Cairo or
Constantinople, and indeed in most Eastern cities.These are mere
establishments for the convenience of bathers, consisting generally of
one or two small circular or octagonal halls, covered by domes, and one
or two others of an oblong shape, covered with vaults or wooden roofs,
used as reception-rooms, or places of repose after the bath.These have
never any external magnificence beyond an entrance-porch; and although
those at Pompeii are decorated internally with taste, and are well
worthy of study, their smallness of size and inferiority of design do
not admit of their being placed in the same category as those of the
capital, which are as characteristic of Rome as her amphitheatres, and
are such as could only exist in a capital where the bulk of the people
were able to live on the spoils of the conquered world rather than by
the honest gains of their own industry.Agrippa is said to have built baths immediately behind the Pantheon, and
Palladio and others have attempted restorations of them, assuming that
building to have been the entrance-hall.Nothing, however, can be more
unlikely than that, if he had first built the rotunda as a hall of his
baths, he should afterwards have added the portico, and converted it
from its secular use into a temple dedicated to all the gods.As before remarked, the two parts are certainly not of the same age.If
Agrippa built the rotunda as a part of his baths, the portico was added
a century and a half or two centuries afterwards, and it was then
converted into a temple.If Agrippa built the portico, he added it to a
building belonging to Republican times, which may always have been
dedicated to sacred purposes.As the evidence at present stands, I am
rather inclined to believe the first hypothesis most correctly
represents the facts of the case.[183]

Nero’s baths, too, are a mere heap of shapeless ruins, and those of
Vespasian, Domitian, and Trajan in like manner are too much ruined for
their form, or even their dimensions, to be ascertained with anything
like correctness.Those of Titus are more perfect, but the very
discrepancies that exist between the different systems upon which their
restoration has been attempted show that enough does not remain to
enable the task to be accomplished in a satisfactory manner.They owe
their interest more to the beautiful fresco paintings that adorn their
vaults than to their architectural character.These paintings are
invaluable, as being the most extensive and perfect relics of the
painted decoration of the most flourishing period of the Empire, and
give a higher idea of Roman art than other indications would lead us to
expect.The baths of Constantine are also nearly wholly destroyed, so that out
of the great Thermæ two only, those of Diocletian and of Caracalla, now
remain sufficiently perfect to enable a restoration to be made of them
with anything like certainty.Baths of Caracalla, as restored by A.The great hall belonging to the baths of Diocletian is now the Church of
Sta.Maria degli Angeli, and has been considerably altered to suit the
changed circumstances of its use; while the modern buildings attached to
the church have so overlaid the older remains that it is not easy to
follow out the complete plan.This is of less consequence, as both in
dimensions and plan they are extremely similar to those of Caracalla,
which seem to have been among the most magnificent, as they certainly
are the best preserved, of these establishments.[184]

The general plan of the whole enclosure of the baths of Caracalla was a
square of about 1150 ft.each way, with a bold but graceful curvilinear
projection on two sides, containing porticoes, gymnasia, lecture-rooms,
and other halls for exercise of mind or body.In the rear were the
reservoirs to contain the requisite supply of water and below them the
hypocaust or furnace, by which it was warmed with a degree of scientific
skill we hardly give the Romans of that age credit for.Opposite to this
and facing the street was one great portico extending the whole length
of the building, into which opened a range of apartments, meant
apparently to be used as private baths, which extend also some way up
each side.In front of the hypocaust, facing the north-east, was a
semicircus or _theatridium_, 530 ft.long, where youths performed their
exercises or contended for prizes.These parts were, however, merely the accessories of the establishment
surrounding the garden, in which the principal building was placed.by 380, with a projection covered by a dome on
the south-western side, which was 167 ft.There were two small courts (A A) included in the
block, but nearly the whole of the rest appears to have been roofed
over.The modern building which approaches nearest in extent to this is
probably our Parliament Houses.in length, with
an average breadth of about 300, and, with Westminster Hall, cover as
nearly as may be the same area as the central block of these baths.But
there the comparison stops; there is no building of modern times on
anything like the same scale arranged wholly for architectural effect as
this one is, irrespective of any utilitarian purpose.On the other hand,
the whole of the walls being covered with stucco, and almost all the
architecture being expressed in that material, must have detracted
considerably from the monumental grandeur of the effect.Judging,
however, from what remains of the stucco ornament of the roof of the
Maxentian basilica (Woodcut No.202), it is wonderful to observe what
effects may be obtained with even this material in the hands of a people
who understand its employment.While stone and marble have perished, the
stucco of these vaults still remains, and is as impressive as any other
relic of ancient Rome.In the centre was a great hall (B), almost identical in dimensions with
the central aisle of the basilica of Maxentius already described, being
82 ft.wide by 170 in length, and roofed in the same manner by an
intersecting vault in three compartments, springing from eight great
pillars.This opened into a smaller apartment at each end, of
rectangular form, and then again into two other semicircular halls
forming a splendid suite 460 ft.This central room is
generally considered as the _tepidarium_, or warmed apartment, having
four warm baths opening out of it.On the north-east side was the
frigidarium, or cold water bath, a hall[185] of nearly the same
dimensions as the central Hall.Between this and the circular hall (D)
was the sudatorium or sweating-bath, with a hypocaust underneath, and
flue-tiles lining its walls.The laconicum or caldarium (D) is an
immense circular hall, 116 ft.in diameter, also heated by a hypocaust
underneath, and by flue tiles in the walls.This rotunda is said to be
of later date than Caracalla.There are four other rooms on this side,
which seem also to have been cold baths.None of these points have,
however, yet been satisfactorily settled, nor the uses of the smaller
subordinate rooms; every restorer giving them names according to his own
ideas.For our purpose it suffices to know that no groups of state
apartments in such dimensions, and wholly devoted to purposes of display
and recreation, were ever before or since grouped together under one
roof.The taste of many of the decorations would no doubt be faulty, and
the architecture shows those incongruities inseparable from its state of
transition; but such a collection of stately halls must have made up a
whole of greater splendour than we can easily realise from their bare
and weather-beaten ruins, or from anything else to which we can compare
them.Even allowing for their being almost wholly built of brick, and
for their being disfigured by the bad taste inseparable from everything
Roman, there is nothing in the world which for size and grandeur can
compare with these imperial places of recreation.[186]




                               CHAPTER V.

             TRIUMPHAL ARCHES, TOMBS, AND OTHER BUILDINGS.Arches at Rome; in France—Arch at Trèves—Columns of
  Victory—Tombs—Minerva Medica—Provincial tombs—Eastern tombs—Domestic
  architecture—Spalato—Pompeii—Bridges—Aqueducts.Triumphal Arches were among the most peculiar of the various forms of
art which the Romans borrowed from those around them, and used with that
strange mixture of splendour and bad taste which characterises all their
works.(From a plate in
Gailhabaud’s ‘Architecture.’)]

These were in the first instance no doubt borrowed from the Etruscans,
as was also the ceremony of the triumph with which they were ultimately
associated.At first they seem rather to have been used as festal
entrances to the great public roads, the construction of which was
considered one of the most important benefits a ruler could confer upon
his country.There was one erected at Rimini in honour of an important
restoration of the Flaminian way by Augustus; another at Susa in
Piedmont, to commemorate a similar act of the same Emperor.Trajan built
one on the pier at Ancona, when he restored that harbour, and another at
Beneventum, when he repaired the Via Appia, represented in the preceding
woodcut (No.It is one of the best preserved as well as most
graceful of its class in Italy.The Arch of the Sergii at Pola in Istria
seems also to have been erected for a like purpose.That of Hadrian at
Athens, and another built by him at Antinoë in Egypt, were monuments
merely commemorative of the benefits which he had conferred on those
cities by the architectural works he had erected within their walls.By
far the most important application of these gateways, in Rome at least,
was to commemorate a triumph which may have passed along the road over
which the arch was erected, and perhaps in some instances they may have
been erected beforehand, for the triumphal procession to pass through,
and of which they would remain memorials.The Arch of Titus at Rome is well known for the beauty of its detail, as
well as from the extraordinary interest which it derives from having
been erected to commemorate the conquest of Jerusalem, and consequently
representing in its bassi-rilievi the spoils of the Temple.From the
annexed elevation, drawn to the usual scale, it will be seen that the
building is not large, and it is not so well proportioned as that at
Beneventum, represented in the preceding woodcut, the attic being
overpoweringly high.The absence of sculpture on each side of the arch
is also a defect, for the real merit of these buildings is their being
used as frameworks for the exhibition of sculptural representations of
the deeds they were erected to commemorate.In the later days of the Empire two side arches were added for
foot-passengers, in addition to the carriage-way in the centre.This
added much to the splendour of the edifice, and gave a greater
opportunity for sculptural decoration than the single arch afforded.The
Arch of Septimius Severus, represented to the same scale in Woodcut No.217, is perhaps the best specimen of the class.That of Constantine is
very similar and in most respects equal to this—a merit which it owes to
most of its sculptures being borrowed from earlier monuments.More splendid than either of these is the Arch at Orange.It is not
known by whom it was erected, or even in what age: it is, however,
certainly very late in the Roman period, and shows a strong tendency to
treat the order as entirely subordinate, and to exalt the plain masses
into that importance which characterises the late transitional period.Unfortunately its sculptures are so much destroyed by time and violence
that it is not easy to speak with certainty as to their age; but more
might be done than has hitherto been effected to illustrate this
important monument.At Rheims there is an arch which was probably much more magnificent than
this.When in a perfect state it was 110 ft.in width, and had three
openings, the central one 17 ft.high, and those on each
side 10 ft.in width, each separated by two Corinthian columns.From the
style of the sculpture it certainly was of the last age of the Roman
Empire, but having been built into the walls of the city, it has been so
much injured that it is difficult to say what its original form may have
been.Besides these there is in France a very elegant single-arched gateway at
St.Rémi, similar to and probably of the same age as that at Beneventum;
another at Cavallon, and one at Carpentras, each with one arch.There is
also one with two similar arches at Langres; and one, the Porta Nigra,
at Besançon, which shows so complete a transition from the Roman style
that it is difficult to believe that it does not belong to the
Renaissance.[187] (From Laborde’s
‘Monumens de la France.’)]

There still remains in France another class of arches, certainly not
triumphal, but so similar to those just mentioned that it is difficult
to separate the one from the other.The most important of these are two
at Autun, called respectively the Porte Arroux and the Porte St.André,
a view of which is given in Woodcut No.Each of these has two
central large archways for carriages, and one on each side for
foot-passengers.Their most remarkable peculiarity is the light arcade
or gallery that runs across the top of them, replacing the attic of the
Roman arch, and giving a degree of lightness combined with height that
those never possessed.These gates were certainly not meant for defence,
and the apartment over them could scarcely be applied to utilitarian
purposes; so that we may, I believe, consider it as a mere ornamental
appendage, or as a balcony for display on festal occasions.It appears,
however, to offer a better hint for modern arch-builders than any other
example of its class.Plan of Porta Nigra at Trèves.View of the Porta Nigra at Trèves.]Even more interesting than these gates at Autun is that called the Porta
Nigra at Trèves; for though far ruder in style and coarser in detail, as
might be expected from the remoteness of the province where it is found,
it is far more complete.Indeed it is the only example of its class
which we possess in anything like its original state.Its front consists
of a double archway surmounted by an arcaded gallery, like the French
examples.Within this is a rectangular court which seems never to have
been roofed, and beyond this a second double archway similar to the
first.At the ends of the court, projecting each way beyond the face of
the gateway and the gallery surmounting it, are two wings four storeys
in height, containing a series of apartments in the form of small
basilicas, all similar to one another, and measuring about 55 ft.It is not easy to understand how these were approached, as there is no
stair and no place for one.Of course there must have been some mode of
access, and perhaps it may have been on the site of the apse, shown in
the plan (Woodcut No.219), which was added when the building was
converted into a church in the Middle Ages.These apartments were
probably originally used as courts or chambers of justice, thus
realising, more nearly than any other European example I am acquainted
with, the idea of a gate of justice.Notwithstanding its defects of detail, there is a variety in the outline
of this building and a boldness of profile that render it an extremely
pleasing example of the style adopted; and though exhibiting many of the
faults incidental to the design of the Colosseum, it possesses all that
repetition of parts and Gothic feeling of design which give such value
to its dimensions, though these are far from being contemptible, the
building being 115 ft.wide by 95 in height to the top of the wings.(From Laborde’s ‘Monumens de la
France.’)]

There probably were many similar gates of justice in the province, but
all have perished, unless we except those at Autun just described.I am
convinced that at that place there were originally such wings as these
at Trèves, and that the small church, the apse of which is seen on the
right hand (woodcut No.220), stands upon the foundations of one of
these.A slight excavation on the opposite side would settle this point
at once.If it could be proved that these gateways at Autun had such
lateral adjuncts, it would at once explain the use of the gallery over
the arch, which otherwise looks so unmeaning, but would be intelligible
as a passage connecting the two wings together.Another form also is that of an arch at the entrance of a bridge,
generally bearing an inscription commemorative of its building.Its
purpose is thus closely connected with that of the arches before
mentioned, which commemorate the execution of roads.Most of the great
bridges of Italy and Spain were so adorned; but unfortunately they have
either been used as fortifications in the Middle Ages, or removed in
modern times to make room for the increased circulation of traffic.That
built by Trajan on his noble bridge at Alcantara in Spain is well known;
and there exists a double-arched bridge at Saintes, in the south of
France.The most elegant and most perfect specimen, however, of this
class is that of St.Chamas in Provence, represented in woodcut No.It consists of two arches, one at each end of the bridge, of singular
elegance of form and detail.Although it bears a still legible
inscription, it is uncertain to what age it belongs, probably that of
the Antonines: and I would account for the purity of its details by
referring to the Greek element that pervades the south of France.Whether this is so or not, it is impossible not to admire not only the
design of the whole bridge with its two arches, but the elegance with
which the details have been executed.Used in this mode as commencements of roads, or entrances to bridges, or
as festal entrances to unfortified towns, there are perhaps no monuments
of the second class more appropriate or more capable of architectural
expression than these arches, though all of them have been more or less
spoiled by an incongruous order being applied to them.Used, however, as
they were in Rome, as monuments of victory, without offering even an
excuse for a passage through them, the taste displayed in them is more
than questionable: the manner, too, in which they were cut up by broken
cornices and useless columns placed on tall pedestals, with other
trivial details highly objectionable, deprive them of that largeness of
design which is the only true merit and peculiar characteristic of Roman
art, while that exquisite elegance with which the Greeks knew so well
how to dignify even the most trivial objects was in them almost entirely
lost.Columns of Victory are a class of monuments which seem to have been used
in the East in very early times, though their history it must be
confessed is somewhat fragmentary and uncertain, and they seem to have
been adopted by the Romans in those provinces where they had been
employed by the earlier inhabitants.Whatever the original may have
been, the Romans were singularly unsuccessful in their application of
the form.They never, in fact, rose above the idea of taking a column of
construction, magnifying it, and placing it on a pedestal, without any
attempt to modify its details or hide the original utilitarian purpose
for which the column was designed.When they attempted more than this,
they failed entirely in elaborating any new form at all worthy of
admiration.The Columna Rostrata, or that erected to celebrate naval
victories, was, so far as we can judge from representations (for no
perfect specimen exists), one of the ugliest and clumsiest forms of
column it is possible to conceive.Of those of Victory, one of the most celebrated is that erected by
Diocletian at Alexandria.A somewhat similar one exists at Arsinoë,
erected by Alexander Severus; and a third at Mylassa in Caria.All these
are mere Corinthian columns of the usual form, and with the details of
those used to support entablatures in porticoes.However beautiful these
may be in their proper place, they are singularly inappropriate and
ungraceful when used as minarets or single columns.(From Laborde’s ‘Monumens de la
France.’)]

There are two in Rome not quite so bad as these, both being of the Doric
order.Had the square abacus in these been cut to a round form, and
ornamented with an appropriate railing, we might almost have forgotten
their original, and have fancied that they really were round towers with
balconies at the top.The great object of their erection was to serve as
vehicles for sculpture, though, as we now see them, or as they are
caricatured at Paris and elsewhere, they are little more than instances
of immense labour bestowed to very little purpose.As originally used,
these columns were placed in small courts surrounded by open porticoes,
whence the spectator could at two or perhaps at three different levels
examine the sculpture at his leisure and at a convenient distance, while
the absurdity of the column supporting nothing was not apparent, from
its not being seen from the outside.This arrangement is explained in
woodcut No.200, which is a section through the basilica of Trajan,
showing the position of his column, not only with reference to that
building, but to the surrounding colonnade.The same was almost
certainly the case with the column of Marcus Aurelius, which, with
slight modifications, seems to have been copied from that of Trajan; but
even in the most favourable situations no monuments can be less worthy
of admiration or of being copied than these.A far better specimen of this class is that at Cussi, near Beaune, in
France.It probably belongs to the time of Aurelian, but it is not known
either by whom it was erected or what victory it was designed to
celebrate; still that it is a column of victory seems undoubted; and its
resemblance to columns raised with the same object in India is quite
striking.The arrangement of the base serving as a pedestal for eight statues is
not only elegant but appropriate.The ornament which covers the shaft
takes off from the idea of its being a mere pillar, and at the same time
is so subdued as not to break the outline or interfere with constructive
propriety.Supposed Capital of Column at Cussi.]The capital, of the Corinthian order, is found in the neighbourhood used
as the mouth of a well.In its original position it no doubt had a hole
through it, which being enlarged suggested its application to its
present ignoble purpose, the hole being no doubt intended either to
receive or support the statue or emblem that originally crowned the
monument, but of that no trace now remains.There cannot be a more natural mode of monumental expression than that
of a simple upright stone set up by the victors to commemorate their
prowess and success.Accordingly steles or pillars erected for this
purpose are found everywhere, and take shapes as various as the
countries where they stand or the people who erected them.In Northern
Europe they are known as Cath or battle-stones, and as rude unhewn
monoliths are found everywhere.In India they are as elegant and as
elaborately adorned as the Kutub Minar at Delhi, but nowhere was their
true architectural expression so mistaken as in Rome.There, by
perverting a feature designed for one purpose to a totally different
use, an example of bad taste was given till then unknown, though in our
days it has become not uncommon.In that strange collection of the styles of all nations which mingled
together makes up the sum of Roman art, nothing strikes the
architectural student with more astonishment than the number and
importance of their tombs.If the Romans are of Aryan origin, as is
generally assumed, they are the only people of that race among whom
tomb-building was not utterly neglected.The importance of the tombs
among the Roman remains proves one of two things.Either a considerable
proportion of Etruscan blood was mixed up with that of the dominant race
in Rome, or that the fierce and inartistic Romans, having no art of
their own, were led blindly to copy that of the people among whom they
were located.Of the tombs of Consular Rome nothing remains except perhaps the
sarcophagus of Scipio; and it is only on the eve of the Empire that we
meet with the well-known one of Cæcilia Metella, the wife of Crassus,
which is not only the best specimen of a Roman tomb now remaining to us,
but the oldest architectural building of the imperial city of which we
have an authentic date.It consists of a bold square basement about 100
ft.square, which was originally ornamented in some manner not now
intelligible.From this rose a circular tower about 94 ft.in diameter,
of very bold masonry, surmounted by a frieze of ox-skulls with wreaths
joining them, and a well-profiled cornice: two or three courses of
masonry above this seem to have belonged to the original work; and above
this, almost certainly, in the original design rose a conical roof,
which has perished.The tower having been used as a fortress in the
Middle Ages, battlements have been added to supply the place of the
roof, and it has been otherwise disfigured, so as to detract much from
its beauty as now seen.Still we have no tomb of the same importance so
perfect, nor one which enables us to connect the Roman tombs so nearly
with the Etruscan.The only addition in this instance is that of the
square basement or podium, though even this was not unknown at a much
earlier period, as for instance in the tomb of Aruns (Woodcut No.The exaggerated height of the circular base is also remarkable.Here it
rises to be a tower instead of a mere circular base of stones for the
earthen cone of the original sepulchre.The stone roof which probably
surmounted the tower was a mere reproduction of the original earthen
cone.Tomb of Cæcilia Metella.]Next in age and importance was the tomb of Augustus in the Campus
Martius.It is now so completely ruined that it is extremely difficult
to make out its plan, and those who drew and restored it in former days
were so careless in their measurements that even its dimensions cannot
be ascertained; it appears, however, to have consisted of a circular
basement about 300 ft.in height, adorned
with 12 large niches.Above this rose a cone of earth as in the Etruscan
tombs, not smooth like those, but divided into terraces, which were
planted with trees.We also learn from Suetonius that Augustus laid out
the grounds around his tomb and planted them with gardens for public use
during his lifetime.More like the practice of a true Mogul in the East
than the ruler of an Indo-Germanic people in Europe.This tomb, however, was far surpassed, not only in solidity but in
splendour, by that which Hadrian erected for himself on the banks of the
Tiber, now known as the Mole of Hadrian, or more frequently the Castle
of St.The basement of this great tomb was a square, about 340
ft.Above this rose a circular tower 235
ft.The whole was crowned either by a
dome or by a conical roof in steps, which, with its central ornament,
must have risen to a height of not less than 300 ft.The circular or
tower-like part of this splendid building was ornamented with columns,
but in what manner restorers have not been quite able to agree; some
making two storeys, both with pillars, some, one of pillars and the
upper one of pilasters.It would require more correct measurements than
we have to enable us to settle this point, but it seems probable that
there was only one range of columns on a circular basement of some
height surmounted by an attic of at least equal dimensions.The order
might have been 70 ft., the base and attic 35 ft.Internally the mass was nearly solid, there being only one sepulchral
apartment, as nearly as may be in the centre of the mass, approached by
an inclined plane, winding round the whole building, from the entrance
in the centre of the river face.Besides these there was another class of tombs in Rome, called
columbaria, generally oblong or square rooms below the level of the
ground, the walls of which were pierced with a great number of little
pigeon-holes or cells just of sufficient size to receive an urn
containing the ashes of the body, which had been burnt according to the
usual Roman mode of disposing of the dead.Externally of course they had
no architecture, though some of the more important family sepulchres of
this class were adorned internally with pilasters and painted ornaments
of considerable beauty.In the earlier ages of the Roman Empire these two forms of tombs
characterised with sufficient clearness the two races, each with their
distinctive customs, which made up the population of Rome.Long before
its expiration the two were fused together so thoroughly that we lose
all trace of the distinction, and a new form of tomb arose compounded of
the two older, which became the typical form with the early Christians,
and from them passed to the Saracens and other Eastern nations.The new form of tomb retained externally the circular form of the
Pelasgic sepulchre, though constructive necessities afterwards caused it
to become polygonal.Instead however of being solid, or nearly so, the
walls were only so thick as was necessary to support the dome, which
became the universal form of roof of these buildings.The sepulchres of Rome have as yet been far too carelessly examined to
enable us to trace all the steps by which the transformation took place,
but as a general rule it may be stated that the gradual enlargement of
the central circular apartment is almost a certain test of the age of a
tomb; till at last, before the age of Constantine, they became in fact
representations of the Pantheon on a small scale, almost always with a
crypt or circular vault below the principal apartment.Section of Sepulchre at San Vito.One of the most curious transitional specimens is that found near San
Vito, represented in Woodcut No.Here, as in all the earlier
specimens, the principal apartment is the lower, in the square basement.The upper, which has lost its decoration, has the appearance of having
been hollowed out of the frustum of a gigantic Doric column, or rather
out of a solid tower like the central one of the Tomb of Aruns (Woodcut
No.Shortly after the age of this sepulchre the lower apartment
became a mere crypt, and in such examples as those of the sepulchres of
the Cornelia and Tossia families we have merely miniature Pantheons
somewhat taller in proportion, and with a crypt.This is still more
remarkable in a building called the Torre dei Schiavi, which has had a
portico attached to one side, and in other respects looks very like a
direct imitation of that celebrated temple.It seems certainly, however,
to have been built for a tomb.Another tomb, very similar to that of the Tossia family, is called that
of Sta.If it is not hers, it belongs
at any rate to the last days of the Empire, and may be taken as a fair
specimen of the tombs of that age and class.It is a vast transition
from the tomb of Cæcilia Metella, though, like all the changes
introduced by the Romans, it shows the never-failing tendency to
transfer all architectural embellishments from the exterior to the
interior of every style of building.On
this stands a circular tower in two storeys.In the lower storey is a
circular apartment about 66 ft.in diameter, surrounded by eight niches;
in the upper the niches are external, and each is pierced with a window.The dimensions of the tomb are nearly the same as those of Cæcilia
Metella, and it thus affords an excellent opportunity of comparing the
two extremes of the series, and of contrasting the early Roman with the
early Christian tomb.The typical example of a sepulchre of this age is the tomb or baptistery
of Sta.Costanza, the daughter of Constantine (Woodcut No.In this
building the pillars that adorned the exterior of such a mausoleum, for
instance, as that of Hadrian, are introduced internally.Externally the
building never can have had much ornament.But the breaks between the
lower aisle and the central compartment, pierced with the clerestory,
must have had a very pleasing effect.In this example there is still
shown a certain degree of timidity, which does not afterwards reappear.The columns are coupled and are far more numerous than they need have
been, and are united by a fragment of an entablature, as if the
architect had been afraid to place his vault directly on the capitals.Notwithstanding these defects, it is a pleasing and singularly
instructive example of a completed transformation, and is just what we
miss in those secular buildings for which the Christians had no use.Another building, which is now known as the Lateran Baptistery (Woodcut
No.422), was also undoubtedly a place of sepulture.Its erection is
generally ascribed to Constantine, and it is said was intended by him to
be the place of his own sepulture.Whether this is correct or not, it
certainly belongs to his age, and exhibits all the characteristics of
the architecture of his time.Here the central apartment, never having
been designed to support a dome, is of a far lighter construction, an
upper order of pillars being placed on the lower, with merely a slight
architrave and frieze running between the two orders, the external walls
being slight in construction and octagonal in plan.[188] We must not in
this place pursue any further the subject of the transition of style, as
we have already trespassed within the pale of Christian architecture and
passed beyond the limits of Heathen art.So gradual, however, was the
change, and so long in preparation, that it is impossible to draw the
line exactly where the separation actually took place between the two.TEMPLE OF MINERVA MEDICA.One important building remains to be mentioned before leaving this part
of the subject.It commonly goes by the name of the Temple of Minerva
Medica, though this is certainly a misnomer.[189] Recently it has become
the fashion to assume that it was the hall of some bath; no building of
that class, however, was known to exist in the neighbourhood, and it is
extremely improbable that any should be found outside the Servian walls
in this direction; moreover, it is wanting in all the necessary
accompaniments of such an establishment.It is here placed with the tombs, because its site is one that would
justify its being so classed, and its form being just such as would be
applicable to that purpose and to no other.It is not by any means
certain, however, that it is a tomb, though there does not seem to be
any more probable supposition.It certainly belongs to the last days of
the Roman Empire, if indeed it be not a Christian building, which I am
very much inclined to believe it is, for, on comparing it with the
Baptistery of Constantine and the tomb of Sta.Costanza, it shows a
considerable advance in construction on both these buildings, and a
greater similarity to San Vitale at Ravenna, and other buildings of
Justinian’s time, than to anything else now found in Rome.As will be seen from the plan and section (Woodcuts Nos.228 and 229),
it has a dome, 80 ft.in diameter, resting on a decagon of singularly
light and elegant construction.Nine of the compartments contain niches
which give great room on the floor, as well as great variety and
lightness to the general design.Above this is a clerestory of ten
well-proportioned windows, which give light to the building, perhaps not
in so effective a manner as the one eye of the Pantheon, though by a far
more convenient arrangement, to protect from the elements a people who
did not possess glass.So far as I know, all the domed buildings erected
by the Romans up to the time of Constantine, and indeed long afterwards,
were circular in the interior, though, like the temple built by
Diocletian at Spalato, they were sometimes octagonal externally.This,
however, is a Polygon both internally and on the outside, and the mode
in which the dome is placed on the polygon shows the first rudiments of
the pendentive system, which was afterwards carried to such perfection
by the Byzantine architects, but is nowhere else to be found in Rome.It
probably was for the purpose of somewhat diminishing the difficulties of
this construction that the architect adopted a figure with ten instead
of eight sides.Plan of Minerva Medica at Rome, as restored in
Isabelle’s ‘Édifices Circulaires,’ on the theory of its being a Bath.Section of Minerva Medica (from Isabelle.)Rib of the Roof of the Minerva Medica at Rome.]This, too, is, I believe, the first building in which buttresses are
applied so as to give strength to the walls exactly at the point where
it is most wanted.By this arrangement the architect was enabled to
dispense with nearly one-half the quantity of material that was thought
necessary when the dome of the Pantheon was constructed, and which he
must have employed had he copied that building.Besides this, the dome
was ribbed with tiles, as shown in Woodcut No.230, and the space
between the ribs filled in with inferior, perhaps lighter masonry,
bonded together at certain heights by horizontal courses of tiles where
necessary.(From Laborde’s ‘Monumens de la
France.’)]

Besides the lightness and variety which the base of this building
derives from the niches, it is 10 ft.higher than its diameter, which
gives to it that proportion of height to width, the want of which is the
principal defect of the Pantheon.It is not known what the side
erections are which are usually shown in the ground-plans, nor even
whether they are coeval with the main central edifice.I suspect they
have never been very correctly laid down.Taking it altogether, the building is certainly, both as concerns
construction and proportion, by far the most scientific of all those in
ancient Rome, and in these respects as far superior to the Pantheon as
it is inferior to that temple in size.Indeed there are few inventions
of the Middle Ages that are not attempted here or in the Temple of
Peace—but more in this than in the latter; so much so, indeed, that I
cannot help believing that it is much more modern than is generally
supposed.As might be expected from our knowledge of the race that inhabited the
European provinces of the Roman Empire, there are very few specimens of
tombs of any importance to be found in them.One very beautiful example
exists at St.Rémi, represented in the annexed woodcut (No.It can
hardly, however, be correctly called a tomb, but is rather a cenotaph or
a monument, erected as the inscription on it tells us, by Sextus and
Marcus, of the family of the Julii, to their parents, whose statues
appear under the dome of the upper storey.There is nothing funereal
either in the inscription or the form, nor anything to lead us to
suppose that the bodies of the parents repose beneath its foundation.The lower portion of this monument is the square basement which the
Romans always added to the Etruscan form of tomb.Upon this stands a
storey pierced with an archway in each face, with a three-quarter pillar
of the Corinthian order at every angle.The highest part is a circular
colonnade, a miniature copy of that which we know to have once encircled
Hadrian’s Mole.The open arrangement of the arches and colonnade, while it takes off
considerably from the tomb-like simplicity appropriate to such
buildings, adds very much to the lightness and elegance of the whole.Altogether the building has much more of the aspiring character of
Christian art than of the more solid and horizontal forms which were
characteristic of the style then dying out.Another monument of very singular and exceptional form is found at Igel,
near Trèves, in Germany.It is so unlike anything found in Italy, or
indeed anything of the Roman age, that were its date not perfectly known
from the inscription upon it, one might rather be inclined to ascribe it
to the age of Francis I. than to the latter days of the Roman Empire.The form is graceful, though the pilasters and architectural ornaments
seem somewhat misplaced.It is covered with sculptures from top to
bottom.These, however, as is generally the case with Roman funereal
monuments, have no reference to death, nor to the life or actions of the
person to whom the monument is sacred, but are more like the scenes
painted on a wall or ornamental stele anywhere.The principal object on
the face represented in the woodcut is the sun, but the subjects are
varied on each face, and, though much time-worn, they still give a very
perfect idea of the rich ornamentation of the monuments of the last age
of the Empire.Monument at Igel, near Trèves.(From Schmidt’s
‘Antiquities of Trèves.’)]

The Tour Magne at Nîmes is too important a monument to be passed over,
though in its present ruined state it is almost more difficult to
explain than any other Roman remains that have reached our times.It
consists of an octagonal tower 50 ft.The basement is extended beyond this tower on every side by a
series of arches supporting a terrace to which access was obtained by an
external flight of steps, or rather an inclined plane.From the marks in
the walls it seems evident that this terrace originally supported a
peristyle, or, possibly, a range of chambers.Within the basement is a
great chamber covered by a dome of rubble masonry, to which no access
could be obtained from without, but the interior may have been reached
through the eye of the dome.From the terrace an important flight of
steps led upwards to—what?It is almost impossible to refrain from
answering, to a cella, like those which crowned the tomb temples of
Assyria.That the main object of the building was sepulchral seems
hardly doubtful, but we have no other instance in Europe of a tomb with
such a staircase leading to a chamber above it.That Marseilles was a Phœnician and then a Phocian colony long before
Roman times seems generally to be admitted, and that in the Temple of
Diana (Woodcuts Nos.188 and 189) and in this building there is an
Etruscan or Eastern element which can hardly be mistaken, and may lead
to very important ethnographical indications when more fully
investigated and better understood.This scarcity of tombs in the western part of the Roman Empire is to a
great extent made up for in the East; but the history of those erected
under the Roman rule in that part of the world is as yet so little known
that it is not easy either to classify or to describe them; and as
nearly all those which have been preserved are cut in the rock, it is
sometimes difficult—as with other rock-cut objects all over the world—to
understand the form of building from which they were copied.The three principal groups of tombs of the Roman epoch are those of
Petra, Cyrene, and Jerusalem.Though many other important tombs exist in
those countries, they are so little known that they must be passed over
for the present.From the time when Abraham was laid in the cave of Machpelah until after
the Christian era, we know that burying in the rock was not the
exception but the general practice among the nations of this part of the
East.So far as can be known, the example was set by Egypt, which was
the parent of much of their civilisation.In Egypt the façades of their
rock-cut tombs were—with the solitary exception of those of Beni
Hasan[190]—ornamented so simply and unobtrusively as rather to belie
than to announce their internal magnificence.All the oldest Asiatic
tombs seem to have been mere holes in the rock, wholly without
architectural decorations.(From Laborde’s ‘Petra and Mount Sinai.’)]

We have seen, however, how the Persian kings copied their palace façades
to adorn their last resting-places, and how about the same time in Lycia
the tomb-builders copied, first their own wooden structures, and
afterwards the architectural façades which they had learned from the
Greeks how to construct.But it was not till the Roman period that this
species of magnificence extended to the places enumerated above; when to
such an extent did it prevail at Petra as to give to that now deserted
valley the appearance of a petrified city of the dead.The typical and most beautiful tomb of this place is that called the
Khasné or Treasury of Pharaoh—represented in elevation and section in
the annexed woodcuts, Nos.As will be seen, it consists of
a square basement, adorned with a portico of four very beautiful
Corinthian pillars, surmounted by a pediment of low Grecian pitch.Above
this are three very singular turrets, the use and application of which
it is extremely difficult to understand.The central one is circular,
and is of a well-understood sepulchral form, the use of which, had it
been more important, or had it stood alone, would have been intelligible
enough; but what are the side turrets?If one might hazard so bold a
conjecture, I would suggest that the original from which this is derived
was a five-turreted tomb, like that of Aruns (Woodcut No.176), or that
of Alyattes at Sardis, which in course of time became translated into so
foreign a shape as this; but where are the intermediate forms?and by
whom and when was this change effected?Before forming any theories on
this subject, it will be well to consider whether all these buildings
really are tombs.Most of them undoubtedly are so; but may not the name
_el Deir_, or the Convent, applied by the Arabs to one of the principal
rock-cut monuments of Petra, be after all the true designation?Are none
of them, in short, cells for priests, like the _viharas_ found in India?All who have hitherto visited these spots have assumed at once that
everything cut in the rock must be a tomb, but I am much mistaken if
this is really the case with all.(From Laborde’s ‘Mount
Sinai,’ p.To return, however, to the Khasné.Though all the forms of the
architecture are Roman, the details are so elegant and generally so well
designed as almost to lead to the suspicion that there must have been
some Grecian influence brought to bear upon the work.The masses of rock
left above the wings show how early a specimen of its class it is, and
how little practice its designers could have had in copying in the rock
the forms of their regular buildings.(From Laborde’s ‘Sinai,’ p.A little further within the city is found another very similar in design
to this, but far inferior to it in detail and execution, and showing at
least a century of degradation, though at the same time presenting an
adaptation to rock-cut forms not found in the earlier examples.A third is that above alluded to, called _el Deir_.This is the same in
general outline as the two former—of an order neither Greek nor Roman,
but with something like a Doric frieze over a very plain Corinthian
capital.In other respects it presents no new feature except the
apparent absence of a door, and on the whole it seems, if finished, to
deserve its name less than either of the other two.(From Laborde’s ‘Sinai,’
p.Perhaps the most singular object among these tombs, if tombs they are,
is the flat façade with three storeys of pillars one over the
other—slightly indicated on the left of the Corinthian tomb in Woodcut
No.It is like the proscenium of some of the more recent Greek
theatres.If it was really the frontispiece to a tomb, it was totally
unsuitable to the purpose, and is certainly one of the most complete
misapplications of Greek architecture ever made.Generally speaking, the interiors of these buildings are so plain that
travellers have not cared either to draw or measure them; one, however,
represented in the annexed woodcut (No.236), is richly ornamented, and,
as far as can be judged from what is published, is as unlike a tomb as
it is like a _vihara_.But, as before remarked, they all require
re-examination before the purpose for which they were cut can be
pronounced upon with any certainty.Façade of Herod’s Tombs, from a Photograph.]The next group of tombs is that at Jerusalem.These are undoubtedly all
sepulchres.By far the greater number of them are wholly devoid of
architectural ornament.To the north of the city is a group known as the
Tombs of the Kings, with a façade of a corrupt Doric order, similar to
some of the latest Etruscan tombs.[191] These are now very much ruined,
but still retain sufficient traces of the original design to fix their
date within or subsequently to the Herodian period without much
possibility of doubt.A somewhat similar façade, but of a form more like
the Greek Doric, found in the Valley of Jehoshaphat, bears the name of
the Sepulchre of St.So-called “Tomb of Zechariah.”]

Close to this is a square tomb, known as that of Zechariah, cut in the
rock, but standing free.Each face is adorned with Ionic pillars and
square piers at the angles, the whole being crowned with a pyramidal
roof.Perhaps this building should properly be called a cenotaph, as it
is perfectly solid, and no cave or sepulchral vault has been found
beneath it, though judging from analogies one might yet be found if
properly looked for.A tomb with an architectural façade, similar to
that of the so-called Tomb of the Judges, does exist behind it cut in
rock, and is consequently of more modern construction.It may be to mark
this that the architectural monolith was left.Close to this is another identical with it in as far as the basement is
concerned, and which is now popularly known as the Tomb of Absalom; but
in this instance the pyramid has been replaced with a structural spire,
and it is probable when this was done that the chamber which now exists
in its interior was excavated.The so-called Tomb of Absalom.]One of the remarkable points in these tombs is the curious jumble of the
Roman orders which they present.The pillars and pilasters are Ionic,
the architraves and frieze Doric, and the cornice Egyptian.The capitals
and frieze are so distinctly late Roman, that we can feel no hesitation
as to their date being either of the age of Herod or subsequent to that
time.In an architectural point of view the cornice is too plain to be
pleasing if not painted; it probably therefore was so treated.Another class of these tombs is represented by the so-called Tomb of the
Judges (Woodcut No.These are ornamented by a tympanum of a Greek
or Roman temple filled with a scroll-work of rich but debased pattern,
and is evidently derived from something similar, though Grecian in
design.In age it is certainly more recent than the so-called Tomb of
Zechariah, as one of precisely similar design is found cut into the face
of the rock out of which that monument was excavated.Façade of the Tomb of the Judges.]The third group is that of Cyrene, on the African coast.Notwithstanding
the researches of Admiral Beechey and of M. Pacho,[192] and the still
more recent explorations of Messrs.Smith and Porcher, above referred to
(p.285), they are still much less perfectly known to us than they
should be.Their number is immense, and they almost all have
architectural façades, generally consisting of two or more columns
between pilasters, like the grottoes of Beni-Hasan, or the Tomb of St.Many of them show powerful evidence of Greek taste,
while some may be as old as the Grecian era, though the greater part are
undoubtedly of Roman date, and the paintings with which many of them are
still adorned are certainly Roman in design.Two of them are illustrated
by Woodcuts Nos.165 and 166: one as showing more distinct evidence of
Greek taste and colour than is to be found elsewhere, though it is
doubtful if it belongs to the Grecian period any more than the so-called
Tomb of St.James at Jerusalem; the other, though of equally uncertain
date, is interesting as being a circular monument built over a cave like
that at Amrith (Woodcut No.122), and is the only other example now
known.None of them have such splendid architectural façades as the
Khasné at Petra; but the number of tombs which are adorned with
architectural features is greater than in that city, and, grouped as
they are together in terraces on the hill-side, they constitute a
necropolis which is among the most striking of the ancient world.Altogether this group, though somewhat resembling that at Castel d’Asso,
is more extensive and far richer in external architecture.[193]


Time has not left us any perfect structural tombs in all these places,
though there can be little doubt but they were once numerous.Almost the
only tomb of this class constructed in masonry known to exist, and which
in many respects is perhaps the most interesting of all, is found in
Asia Minor, at Mylassa in Caria.In form it is something like the
free-standing rock-cut examples at Jerusalem.As shown in the woodcut
(No.242), it consists of a square base, which supports twelve columns,
of which the eight inner ones support a dome, the outer four merely
completing the square.The dome itself is constructed in the same manner
as all the Jaina domes are in India (as will be explained hereafter when
describing that style), and, though ornamented with Roman details, is so
unlike anything else ever built by that people, and is so completely and
perfectly what we find reappearing ten centuries afterwards in the far
East, that we are forced to conclude that it belongs to a style once
prevalent and long fixed in these lands, though this one now stands as
the sole remaining representative of its class.(From ‘Antiquities of Ionia,’
published by the Dilettanti Society.)]Another example, somewhat similar in style, though remotely distant in
locality, is found at Dugga, near Tunis, in Africa.This, too, consists
of a square base, taller than in the last example, surmounted by twelve
Ionic columns, which are here merely used as ornaments.There were
probably square pilasters at the angles, like that at Jerusalem
(Woodcuts Nos.238, 239), while the Egyptian form of the cornice is
similar to that found in these examples, though with the omission of the
Doric frieze.It apparently originally terminated in a pyramid of steps like the
Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, and a large number of structural tombs which
copied that celebrated model.Nothing of this now remains but the four
corner-stones, which were architecturally most essential to accentuate
the weak lines of a sloping pyramid in such a situation.Taken
altogether, perhaps no more graceful monument of its class has come down
to our days than this must have been when complete.Besides these there are in Algeria two tombs of very great interest,
both from their size and the peculiarity of their forms.The best known
is that on the coast a short distance from Algiers to the westward.It
is generally known as the Kubr Roumeïa, or Tomb of the Christian
Virgin—a name it acquired from its having four false doors, each of a
single stone divided into four panels, and the stile between them
forming a cross, which has consequently been assumed to be the Christian
symbol.The building itself, which is circular, and as nearly as may be
200 ft.in diameter, stands on a square platform measuring 210 ft.The
perpendicular part is ornamented by 60 engaged columns of the Ionic
order, and by the four false doors just mentioned; above this rose a
cone—apparently in 40 steps—making the total height about 130 ft.It is,
however, so ruined that it is very difficult to feel sure about its
exact dimensions or form.Plan of the Kubr Roumeïa.(From a plate in Blakesley’s ‘Four
Months in Algeria.’)]

From objects and scribblings of various kinds found in the interior, it
appears to have remained open till nearly the time of the Moslem
conquest, but shortly afterwards to have been closed, and to have defied
all the ingenuity of explorers till a passage was forced in 1866 by
Messrs.MacCarthy and Berbrugger, acting under the orders and at the
expense of the late Emperor Napoleon III.[194] The entrance was found
passing under the sill of the false door on the east from a detached
building standing outside the platform, and which seems to have been
originally constructed to cover and protect the entrance.From this a
winding passage, 560 ft.in length, led to the central chamber where it
is assumed the royal bodies were once deposited, but when opened no
trace of them remained, nor anything to indicate who they were, nor in
what manner they were buried.The other tomb, the Madracen, is very similar to this one, but smaller.Its peristyle is of a sort of Doric order, without bases, and surmounted
by a quasi-Egyptian cornice, not unlike that on the Tomb of Absalom at
Jerusalem (Woodcut No.240), or that at Dugga (Woodcut No.Altogether its details are more elegant, and from their general
character there seems no reason for doubting that this tomb is older
than the Kubr Roumeïa, though they are so similar to each other that
their dates cannot be far distant.[195]

There seems almost no reason for doubting that the Kubr Roumeïa was the
“Monumentum commune Regiæ gentis” mentioned by Pomponius Mela,[196]
about the middle of the first century of our era, and if so, this could
only apply to the dynasty that expired with Juba II., A.D.23, and in
that case the older monument most probably belonged to the previous
dynasty, which ceased to reign with Bocchus III., 33 years before the
birth of Christ.One of the most interesting points connected with these Mauritanian
tombs is their curious similarity to that of Hadrian at Rome.The square
base, the circular colonnade, the conical roof, are all the same.At
Rome they are very much drawn out, of course, but that arose from the
“Mole” being situated among tall objects in a town, and more than even
that, perhaps, from the tendency towards height which manifested itself
so strongly in the architecture of that age.The greatest similarity, however, exists in the interior.The long
winding corridor terminating in an oblong apartment in the centre is an
identical feature in both, but has not yet been traced elsewhere, though
it can be hardly doubted that it must have existed in many other
examples.If we add to these the cenotaph at St.231), we have a
series of monuments of the same type extending over 400 years; and,
though many more are wanted before we can fill up the gaps and complete
the series, there can be little doubt that the missing links once
existed which connected them together.Beyond this we may go still
further back to the Etruscan tumuli and the simple mounds of earth on
the Tartar steppes.At the other end of the series we are evidently
approaching the verge of the towers and steeples of Christian art; and,
though it may seem the wildest of hypotheses to assert that the design
of the spire of Strasbourg grew out of the mound of Alyattes, it is
nevertheless true, and it is only non-apparent because so many of the
steps in the progress from the one to the other have disappeared in the
convulsions of the interval.We know, not only from the descriptions and incidental notices that have
come down to us, but also from the remains found at Pompeii and
elsewhere, that the private dwellings of the Romans were characterised
by that magnificence and splendour which we find in all their works,
accompanied, probably, with more than the usual amount of bad taste.In Rome itself no ancient house—indeed no trace of a domestic
edifice—exists except the palaces of the Cæsars on the Palatine Mount,
and the house of the Vestal Virgins[197] at its foot; and these even are
now a congeries of shapeless ruins, so completely destroyed as to make
it difficult even for the most imaginative of restorers to make much of
them.The extent of these ruins, however, coupled with the descriptions
that have been preserved, suffice to convince us that, of all the
palaces ever built, either in the East or the West, these were probably
the most magnificent and the most gorgeously adorned.Never in the
world’s history does it appear that so much wealth and power were at the
command of one man as was the case with the Cæsars; and never could the
world’s wealth have fallen into the hands of men more inclined to lavish
it for their own personal gratification than these emperors were.They
could, moreover, ransack the whole world for plunder to adorn their
buildings, and could command the best artists of Greece, and of all the
subject kingdoms, to assist in rendering their golden palaces the most
gorgeous that the world had then seen, or is likely soon to see again.The whole area of the palace may roughly be described as a square
platform measuring 1500 ft.east and west, with a mean breadth of 1300
ft.Owing, however, to its deeply indented
and irregular outline, it hardly covers more ground than the Baths of
Caracalla.Recent excavations have laid bare nearly the whole of the western
portion of this area, and have disclosed the plan of the building, but
all has been so completely destroyed that it requires considerable skill
and imagination to reinstate it in its previous form.The one part that
remains tolerably perfect is the so-called house of Livia the wife of
Augustus, who is said to have lived in it after the death of her
husband.In dimensions and arrangement it is not unlike the best class
of Pompeian houses, but its paintings and decorations are very superior
to anything found in that city.They are, in fact, as might be expected
from their age and position, the finest mural decorations that have come
down to us, and as they are still wonderfully perfect, they give a very
high idea of the perfection of art attained in the Augustan age, to
which they certainly belong.That part of the palace on the Palatine which most impresses the visitor
is the eastern half, which looks on one hand to the Amphitheatre, on the
other to the Baths of Caracalla, and overhangs the Circus Maximius.Though all their marble or painted decorations are gone, the enormous
masses of masonry which here exist convey that impression of grandeur
which is generally found in Roman works.It is not of Æsthetic beauty
arising from ornamental or ornamented construction, but the Technic
expression of power and greatness arising from mass and stability.It is
the same feeling with which we contemplate the aqueducts and engineering
works of this great people; and, though not of the highest class, few
scenes of architectural grandeur are more impressive than the now ruined
Palace of the Cæsars.Notwithstanding all this splendour, this palace was probably as an
architectural object inferior to the Thermæ.The thousand and one
exigencies of private life render it impossible to impart to a
residence—even to that of the world’s master—the same character of
grandeur as may be given to a building wholly devoted to show and public
purposes.In its glory the Palace of the Cæsars must have been the
world’s wonder; but as a ruin deprived of its furniture and ephemeral
splendour, it loses much that would tend to make it either pleasing or
instructive.We must not look for either beauty of proportion or
perfection of construction, or even for appropriateness of material, in
the hastily constructed halls of men whose unbounded power was only
equalled by the coarse vulgarity of their characters.The only palace of the Roman world of which sufficient remains are still
left to enable us to judge either of its extent or arrangements is that
which Diocletian built for himself at Spalato, in Dalmatia, and in which
he spent the remaining years of his life, after shaking off the cares of
Empire.It certainly gives us a most exalted idea of what the splendour
of the imperial palace at Rome must have been when we find one
emperor—certainly neither the richest nor the most powerful—building,
for his retirement, a villa in the country of almost exactly the same
dimensions as the Escurial in Spain, and consequently surpassing in
size, as it did in magnificence, most of the modern palaces of Europe.It is uncertain how far it resembles or was copied from that in Rome,
more especially as it must be regarded as a fortified palace, which
there is no reason to believe that at Rome was, while its model would
seem to have been the prætorian camp rather than any habitation built
within the protection of the city walls.In consequence of this its
exterior is plain and solid, except on the side next the sea, where it
was least liable to attack.The other three sides are only broken by the
towers that flank them, and by those that defend the great gates which
open in the centre of each face.Palace of Diocletian at Spalato.The building is nearly a regular parallelogram, though not quite so.The
south side is that facing the sea, and is 592 ft.from angle to angle;
the one opposite being only 570 in length;[198] while the east and west
sides measure each 698 ft., the whole building thus covering about 9½
English acres.The principal entrance to the palace is on the north, and is called the
Golden Gate, and, as represented in the annexed woodcut (No.247), shows
all the peculiarities of Roman architecture in its last stage.The
horizontal architrave still remains over the doorway, a useless
ornament, under a bold discharging arch, which usurps its place and does
its duty.Above this, a row of Corinthian columns, standing on brackets,
once supported the archivolts of a range of niches—a piece of pleasing
decoration, it must be confessed, but one in which the original purpose
of the column has been entirely overlooked or forgotten.Entering this portal, we pass along a street ornamented with arcades on
either side, till exactly in the centre of the building this is crossed
at right angles by another similar street, proceeding from the so-called
Iron and Brazen Gates, which are similar to the Golden Gate in design,
but are far less richly ornamented.These streets divided the building into four portions: those to the
north are so much ruined that it is not now easy to trace their plan, or
to say to what purpose they were dedicated; but probably the one might
have been the lodgings of the guests, the other the residence of the
principal officers of the household.The whole of the southern half of the building was devoted to the palace
properly so called.It contained two temples, as they are now
designated.That on the right is said to have been dedicated to Jupiter,
though, judging from its form, it would appear to have been designed
rather as the mausoleum of the founder than as a temple of that god.On
the assumption that it was a temple it has been illustrated at a
previous page.[199] Opposite to it is another small temple, dedicated,
it is said, to Æsculapius.Between these two is the arcade represented in Woodcut No.185, at the
upper end of which is the vestibule—circular, as all buildings dedicated
to Vesta, or taking their name from that goddess, should be.This opened
directly on to a magnificent suite of nine apartments, occupying the
principal part of the south front of the palace.Beyond these, on the
right hand, were the private apartments of the emperor, and behind them
his baths.The opposite side is restored as if it exactly corresponded,
but this is more than doubtful; and, indeed, there is scarcely
sufficient authority for many of the details shown in the plan, though
they are, probably, on the whole, sufficiently exact to convey a general
idea of the arrangements of a Roman imperial palace.(From Sir Gardner
Wilkinson’s ‘Dalmatia.’)]

Perhaps, however, the most splendid feature in this palace was the great
southern gallery, 515 ft.in length by 24 in width, extending along the
whole seaward face of the building.Besides its own intrinsic beauty as
an architectural feature, it evinces an appreciation of the beauties of
nature which one would hardly expect in a Roman.This great arcade is
the principal feature in the whole design, and commands a view well
worthy the erection of such a gallery for its complete enjoyment.POMPEII AND HERCULANEUM.Failing to discover any example of domestic architecture in Rome, we
turn to Pompeii and Herculaneum, where we find numerous and most
interesting examples of houses of all classes, except, perhaps, the
best; for there is nothing there to compare with the Laurentian villa of
Pliny, or with some others of which descriptions have come down to us.Pompeii, moreover, was far more a Grecian than a Roman city, and its
buildings ought to be considered rather as illustrative of those of
Greece, or at least of Magna Græcia, than of anything found to the
northward.Still these cities belonged to the Roman age, and, except in
taste and in minor arrangements, we have no reason to doubt that the
buildings did resemble those of Rome, at least to a sufficient extent
for illustration.With scarcely an exception, all the houses of Pompeii were of one storey
only in height.It is true that in some we find staircases leading to
the roof, and traces of an upper storey, but where this latter is the
case the apartments would appear to have been places for washing and
drying clothes, or for some such domestic purpose rather than for living
or even sleeping rooms.All the principal apartments were certainly on
the ground floor, and as an almost inevitable corollary from this, they
all faced inwards, and were lighted from courtyards or _atria_, and not
from the outside; for, with a people who had not glass with which to
glaze their windows, it was impossible to enjoy privacy or security
without at the same time excluding both light and air, otherwise than by
lighting their rooms from the interior.Hence it arose that in most
instances the outside of the better class of houses was given up to
shops and smaller dwellings, which opened on to the street, while the
residence, with the exception of the principal entrance, and sometimes
one or two private doors that opened outwards, was wholly hidden from
view by their entourage.Even in the smallest class of tradesmen’s houses which opened on the
street, one apartment seems always to have been left unroofed to light
at least two rooms on each side of it, used as bedrooms; but as the
roofs of all are now gone, it is not always easy to determine which were
so treated.It is certain that, in the smallest houses which can have belonged to
persons at all above the class of shopkeepers, there was always a
central apartment, unroofed in the centre, into which the others opened.Sometimes this was covered by two beams placed in one direction, and two
crossing them at right angles, framing the roof into nine compartments,
generally of unequal dimensions, the central one being open, and with a
corresponding sinking in the floor to receive the rain and drainage
which inevitably came through it.When this court was of any extent,
four pillars were required at the intersection of the beams, or angles
of the opening, to support the roof.In larger courts eight, twelve,
sixteen, or more columns were so employed, often apparently more as
decorative objects than as required by the constructive necessities of
the case, and very frequently the numbers of these on either side of the
apartment did not correspond.Frequently the angles were not right
angles, and the pillars were spaced unequally with a careless disregard
of symmetry that strikes us as strange, though in such cases this may
have been preferable to cold and formal regularity, and even more
productive of grace and beauty.Besides these courts, there generally
existed in the rear of the house another bounded by a dead wall at the
further extremity, and which in the smaller houses was painted, to
resemble the garden which the larger mansions possessed in this
direction.The apartments looking on this court were of course perfectly
private, which cannot be said of any of those looking inwards on the
_atrium_.The house called that of Pansa at Pompeii is a good illustration of
these peculiarities, and, as one of the most regular, has been
frequently chosen for the purpose of illustration.(From Gell’s ‘Pompeii’)
Scale 100 ft to 1 in.]248) all the parts that do not belong
to the principal mansion are shaded darker except the doubtful part
marked A, which may either have been a separate house, or the women’s
apartments belonging to the principal one, or, what is even more
probable, it may have been designed so as to be used for either purpose.B is certainly a separate house, and the whole of the remainder of this
side, of the front, and of the third side, till we come opposite to A,
was let off as shops.At C we have the kitchen and servants’ apartments,
with a private entrance to the street, and an opening also to the
principal peristyle of the house.Returning to the principal entrance or front door D, you enter through a
short passage into the outer court E, on each side of which are several
small apartments, used either by the inferior members of the household
or by guests.A wider passage than the entrance leads from this to the
peristyle, or principal apartment of the house.On the left hand are
several small rooms, used no doubt as sleeping apartments, which were
probably closed by half-doors open above and below, so as to admit air
and light, while preserving sufficient privacy, for Roman tastes at
least.In front and on the right hand are two larger rooms, either of
which may have been the triclinium or dining-room, the other being what
we should call the drawing-room of the house.A passage between the
kitchen and the central room leads to a verandah which crosses the whole
length of the house, and is open to the garden beyond.As will be observed, architectural effect has been carefully studied in
this design, a vista nearly 300 ft.in length being obtained from the
outer door to the garden wall, varied by a pleasing play of light and
shade, and displaying a gradually increasing degree of spaciousness and
architectural richness as we advance.All these points must have been
productive of the most pleasing effect when complete, and of more beauty
than has been attained in almost any modern dwelling of like dimensions.Generally speaking the architectural details of the Pompeian houses are
carelessly and ungracefully moulded, though it cannot be denied that
sometimes a certain elegance of feeling runs through them that pleases
in spite of our better judgment.It was not, however, on form that they
depended for their effect; and consequently it is not by that that they
must be judged.The whole architecture of the house was, but
even this was not considered so important as the paintings which covered
the flat surfaces of the walls.Comparing the Pompeian decoration with
that of the baths of Titus, and those of the House of Livia, the only
specimens of the same age and class found in Rome, it must be admitted
that the Pompeian examples show an equally correct taste, not only in
the choice but in the application of the ornaments used, though in the
execution there is generally that difference that might be expected
between paintings executed for a private individual and those for the
Emperor of the Roman world.Notwithstanding this, these paintings, so
wonderfully preserved in this small provincial town, are even now among
the best specimens we possess of mural decoration.They excel the
ornamentation of the Alhambra, as being more varied and more
intellectual.For the same reason they are superior to the works of the
same class executed by the Moslems in Egypt and Persia, and they are far
superior to the rude attempts of the Gothic architects in the Middle
Ages; still they are probably as inferior to what the Greeks did in
their best days as the pillars of the Pompeian peristyles are to the
porticoes of the Parthenon.But though doubtless far inferior to their
originals, those at Pompeii are direct imitations of true Greek
decorative forms; and it is through them alone that we can form even the
most remote idea of the exquisite beauty to which polychromatic
architecture once attained, but which we can scarcely venture to hope it
will ever reach again.One curious point which has hitherto been too much overlooked is, that
in Pompeii there are two perfectly distinct styles of decoration.One of
these is purely Etruscan, both in form and colour, and such as is only
found in the tombs or on the authentic works of the Etruscans.The other
is no less essentially Greek, both in design and colour: it is far more
common than the Etruscan form, and is always easily to be distinguished
from it.The last-mentioned or Greek style of decoration may be again
divided into two varieties; one, the most common, consisting of
ornaments directly copied from Greek models; the other with a
considerable infusion of Roman forms.This Romanised variety of Greek
decoration represents an attenuated and lean style of architecture,
which could only have come into fashion from the continued use of iron
or bronze, or other metallic substances, for pillars and other
architectural members.Vitruvius reprobates it; and in a later age
Cassiodorus speaks of it in a manner which shows that it was practised
in his time.The general adoption of this class of ornament, both at
Pompeii and in the baths of Titus, proves it to have been a very
favourite style at that time.This being the case, it must have either
been a representation of metallic pillars and other architectural
objects then in use, or it must have been copied from painted
decorations.This is a new subject, and cannot be made clear, except at
considerable length and with the assistance of many drawings.It seems,
however, an almost undoubted fact that the Romans did use metal as a
constructive material.Were it only that columns of extreme tenuity are
represented in these paintings, we might be inclined to ascribe it to
mere incorrect drawing; but the whole style of ornament here shown is
such as is never found in stone or brick pillars, and which is only
susceptible of execution in metal.Besides this, the pillars in question
are always shown in the decorations as though simply gilt or bronzed,
while the representations of stone pillars are.All this
evidence goes to prove that a style of art once existed in which metal
was generally employed in all the principal features, all material
traces of which are now lost.The disappearance of all remains of such a
style is easily accounted for by the perishable nature of iron from
rust, and the value and consequent peculation induced by bronze and
similar metals.We are, moreover, aware that much bronze has been
stolen, even in recent days, from the Pantheon and other buildings which
are known to have been adorned with it.Another thing which we learn from these paintings is, that though the
necessities of street architecture compelled these city mansions to take
a rectilinear outline, whenever the Roman architects built in the
country they indulged in a picturesque variety of outline and of form,
which they carried perhaps as far as even the Gothic architects of the
Middle Ages.This indeed we might have expected, from their carelessness
in respect to regularity in their town-houses; but these were interiors,
and were it not for the painted representations of houses, we should
have no means of judging how the same architects would treat an exterior
in the country.From this source, however, we learn that in the exterior
arrangements, in situations where they were not cramped by confined
space, their plans were totally free from all stiffness and formality.In this respect Roman taste coincided with that of all true architecture
in all parts of the world.Each part of the design was left to tell its own tale and to express the
use to which each apartment was applied, though the whole were probably
grouped together with some reference to symmetry.There is certainly
nothing in these ancient examples to justify the precise regularity
which the architects of the Renaissance introduced into their classical
designs, in which they sought to obliterate all distinction between the
component parts in a vain attempt to make one great whole out of a great
number of small discordant fragments.BRIDGES AND AQUEDUCTS.Perhaps the most satisfactory works of the Romans are those which we
consider as belonging to civil engineering rather than to architecture.The distinction, however, was not known in those earlier days.The
Romans set about works of this class with a purpose-like earnestness
that always ensures success, and executed them on a scale which leaves
nothing to be desired; while at the same time they entirely avoided that
vulgarity which their want of refinement allowed almost inevitably to
appear in more delicate or more ornate buildings.Their engineering
works also were free from that degree of incompleteness which is
inseparable from the state of transition in which their architecture was
during the whole period of the Empire.It is owing to these causes that
the substructions of the Appian way strike every beholder with
admiration and astonishment; and nothing impresses the traveller more,
on visiting the once imperial city, than the long lines of aqueducts
that are seen everywhere stretching across the now deserted plain of the
Campagna.It is true they are mere lines of brick arches, devoid of
ornament and of every attempt at architecture properly so called; but
they are so well adapted to the purpose for which they were designed, so
grand in conception, and so perfect in execution, that, in spite of
their want of architectural character, they are among the most beautiful
of the remains of Roman buildings.The aqueducts were not, however, all so devoid of architectural design
as those of the Campagna.That, for instance, known as the Pont du Gard,
built to convey water to the town of Nîmes in France, is one of the most
striking works of antiquity.Its height above the stream is about 180
ft., divided into two tiers of larger arches surmounted by a range of
smaller ones, giving the structure the same finish and effect that an
entablature and cornice gives to a long range of columns.Without the
introduction of one single ornament, or of any member that was not
absolutely wanted, this arrangement converts what is a mere utilitarian
work into an architectural screen of a beauty hitherto unrivalled in its
class.The aqueducts of Segovia and Tarragona in Spain, though not perhaps so
grand, are quite as elegant and appropriate as this; and if they stood
across a line of well wooded and watered valleys, might form as
beautiful objects.Unfortunately the effect is much marred by the houses
and other objects that crowd their bases.above the level of their foundation in the centre.That of Segovia
is raised on light piers, the effect of which is perhaps somewhat
spoiled by numerous offsets, and the upper tier is if anything too light
for the lower.These defects are avoided at Tarragona, the central
arches of which are shown in Woodcut No.In this example the
proportion of the upper to the lower arcade is more perfect, and the
whole bears a character of lightness combined with constructive solidity
and elegance unrivalled, so far as I know, in any other work of its
class.It wants, however, the grandeur of the Pont du Gard; for though
its length is about the same, exceeding 800 ft., it has neither its
height nor the impression of power given by the great arches of that
building, especially when contrasted with those that are smaller.Aqueduct of Tarragona.The Roman bridges were designed on the same grand scale as their
aqueducts, though from their nature they of course could not possess the
same grace and lightness.This was, however, more than compensated by
their inherent solidity and by the manifestation of strength imparted by
the Romans to all these structures.They seem to have been designed to
last for ever; and but for the violence of man, it would be hardly
possible to set limits to their durability.Many still remain in almost
every corner of the Roman Empire; and wherever found are easily
recognised by the unmistakable impress of Roman grandeur which is
stamped upon them.One of the most remarkable of these is that which Trajan erected at
Alcantara, in Spain, represented in the annexed woodcut.The roadway is
perfectly level, as is generally the case in Roman bridges, though the
mode by which this is obtained, of springing the arches from different
levels, is perhaps not the most pleasing.To us at least it is
unfamiliar, and has never, I think, been adopted in modern times.In
such a case we should either have made the arches all equal—a mistake,
considering their different heights—or have built solidly over the
smaller arches to bring up the level, which would have been a far
greater error in construction than the other is in taste.The bridge
consists of six arches, the whole length of the roadway being 650 ft.;
the two central arches are about 100 ft.above the level of the stream which it crosses.The piers are well
proportioned and graceful; and altogether the work is as fine and as
tasteful an example of bridge-building as can be found anywhere, even in
these days of engineering activity.Bridge of Trajan, at Alcantara, in Spain.]The bridge which the same Emperor erected over the Danube was a far more
difficult work in an engineering point of view; but the superstructure
being of wood, resting only on stone piers, it would necessarily have
possessed much less architectural beauty than this, or indeed than many
others.These examples of this class of Roman works must suffice; they are so
typical of the style that it was impossible to omit them altogether,
though the subject scarcely belongs in strictness to the objects of this
work.The bridges and aqueducts of the Romans richly deserve the
attention of the architect, not only because they are in fact the only
works which the Romans, either from taste or from social position, were
enabled to carry out without affectation, and with all their originality
and power, but also because it was in building these works that the
Romans acquired that constructive skill and largeness of proportion
which enabled them to design and carry out works of such vast
dimensions, to vault such spaces, and to give to their buildings
generally that size and impress of power which form their chief and
frequently their only merit.It was this too that enabled them to
originate that new style of vaulted buildings which at one period of the
Middle Ages promised to reach a degree of perfection to which no
architecture of the world had ever attained.The Gothic style, it is
true, perished at a time when it was very far from completed; but it is
a point of no small interest to know where and under what circumstances
it was invented.We shall subsequently have to trace how far it advanced
towards that perfection at which it aimed, but to which it never
reached.Strangely enough, it failed solely because of the revival and
the pernicious influence of that very parent style to which it owed its
birth, and the growth and maturity of which we have just been
describing.It was the grandeur of the edifices reared at Rome in the
first centuries of the Empire which so impressed the architects of the
fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, that they abandoned their own
beautiful style to imitate that of the Romans, but with an incongruity
which seems inevitably to result from all imitations, as contrasted with
true creations, in architectural art.PARTHIAN AND SASSANIAN ARCHITECTURE.Historical notice—Palaces of Al Hadhr and Diarbekr—Domes—Palaces of

There still remains one other style to be described before leaving the
domain of Heathendom to venture into the wide realms of Christian and
Saracenic art with which the remainder of these two volumes is mainly
occupied.Unfortunately it is not one that was of great importance while
it existed, and it is one of which we know very little at present.This
arises partly from the fact that all the principal buildings of the
Sassanian kings were situated on or near the alluvial plains of
Mesopotamia and were therefore built either of sun-burnt or imperfectly
baked bricks, which consequently crumbled to dust, or, where erected
with more durable materials, these have been quarried by the succeeding
inhabitants of these fertile regions.Partly also it arises from the
Sassanians not being essentially a building race.Their religion
required no temples and their customs repudiated the splendour of the
sepulchre, so that their buildings were mainly palaces.One of these,
that at Dustagird, is described by all contemporary historians[200] as
one of the most gorgeous palaces of the East, but its glories were
ephemeral: gold and silver and precious hangings rich in colour and
embroidery made up a splendour in which the more stable arts of
architecture had but little part, and all perished in an hour when
invaded by the victorious soldiers of Heraclius, or the more destructive
hosts of Arabian invaders a few years afterwards.Whatever the cause
however, never was destruction more complete.Two or three ruined
palaces still exist in Persia and Mesopotamia.A fragment known as the
Tâk Kesra still remains to indicate the spot where Ctesiphon once stood,
but the site of Dustagird is still a matter of dispute.So little in
fact remains that we should hardly be able to form an idea of what the
style really was, but for the fortunate discovery of a palace at Mashita
in Moab, which seems undoubtedly to have been erected by the last great
king of this dynasty, and which is yet unsurpassed for beauty of detail
and richness of ornament by any building of its class and age.As nearly as may be, one thousand years had elapsed since the completion
of the palaces at Persepolis and Susa and the commencement of this
building, and for the great part of that period the history of Persian
or Central Asian architecture is a blank.The Seleucidæ built nothing
that has come down to our times.The Parthians, too, have left us
little, so that it is practically only after a hiatus of nearly six
centuries, that we again begin to feel that the art had not entirely
perished in the populous countries of Central Asia; but even then our
history recommences so timidly and with buildings of such uncertain
dates as to be very far from satisfactory.One of the oldest buildings known as belonging to the new school is the
palace of Al Hadhr, situated in the plain, about thirty miles from the
Tigris, nearly west from the ruins of Kaleh Shergat.The city itself is circular in plan, nearly an English mile in diameter,
and surrounded by a stone wall with towers at intervals, in the centre
of which stands a walled enclosure, nearly square in plan, about 700 ft.This is again subdivided into an outer and inner court by a wall
across its centre.The outer court is unencumbered by buildings, the
inner nearly filled with them.[201] The principal of these is that
represented in plan on Woodcut No.It consists of three large and
four smaller halls placed side by side, with various smaller apartments
in the rear.All these halls are roofed by semicircular tunnel-vaults,
without ribs or other ornament, and they are all entirely open in front,
all the light and air being admitted from the one end.There can be little doubt that these halls are copies, or intended to be
so, of the halls of the old Assyrian palaces; but the customs and
requirements of the period have led the architect on to a new class of
arrangements which renders the resemblance by no means apparent at first
sight.Elevation of part of the Palace of Al Hadhr.The old halls had almost invariably their entrances on the longer side,
which with a vault required very thick external walls as abutments.This
was obviated in Al Hadhr by using the halls as abutments the one to the
other like the arches of a bridge; so that, if the two external arches
were firm, all the rest were safe.This was provided for by making the
outer halls smaller, as shown in the elevation (Woodcut No.254), or by
strengthening the outer wall.But even then the architect seems to have
shrunk from weakening the intermediate walls by making too many openings
in them.Those which do exist are small and infrequent; so that there is
generally only one entrance to each apartment, and that so narrow as to
seem incongruous with the size of the room to which it leads.The square apartment at the back would seem to have been a temple, as
the lintel over the entrance doorway (which faces the east) is carved
with the sun, the moon, and other religious emblems; and the double wall
round may have contained a stair or inclined plane leading to an upper
storey, or to rooms which certainly existed over the smaller halls at
least.All the details of the building are copied from the Roman—the archivolts
and pilasters almost literally so, but still so rudely executed as to
prove that it was not done under the direct superintendence of a Roman
artist.This is even more evident with regard to the griffins and
scroll-work, and the acanthus-leaves which ornament the capitals and
friezes.The most peculiar ornament, however, is the range of masks
carried round all the archivolts of the smaller arches.Of the nineteen
voussoirs of the larger arches, seven of them, according to Ross and
Ainsworth, had figures carved on them in relief of angels, or females,
apparently in the air, and with feet crossed and robes flying loose,
possibly emblematic of the seven planets.Even tradition is silent
regarding the date of these remarkable ruins; the town was besieged
unsuccessfully by Trajan in 116 A.D., and it is recorded to have been a
walled town containing a temple of the sun noted for its rich offerings.This is probably the square building at the back of the great hall on
the left of the palace, and the existence of the carved religious
emblems on the lintel suggest that the palace was erected in front at a
later period.Professor Rawlinson, in his notes on the great
monarchies,[202] suggests about 200 A.D.as the probable date, and
ascribes its erection to the monarchs of the Parthian dynasty.There is
no doubt that the execution of the masonry with its fine joints is of a
totally different character from that which is found in Sassanian
buildings, which comes more under the head of rubble masonry, and was
entirely hidden, in the interior at least, by stucco.The ornament also
is of a rich character, Roman in its design, but debased Greek in its
execution.Loftus, during his researches in Chaldea, discovered at
Wurka (the ancient Erech in Mesopotamia), a large number of ornamental
details, in stone and in plaster, of precisely the same character as
those found at Al Hadhr.Among these remains he found a griffin
resembling those carved on the lintel of the square temple before
referred to, and quantities of Parthian coins, so that it is fair to
assume that Al Hadhr belongs to that dynasty.Another building which merits more attention than has hitherto been
bestowed upon it, is now used as the great mosque at Diarbekr.The
ancient portions consist of the façades only of two palaces, the north
and the south, which face one another at a distance of some 400 feet,
and form the boundaries of the great court (Woodcut No.They are
apparently erected with materials taken from some more ancient building,
and whilst the capitals and friezes are of debased Roman character, the
carved shafts of the north palace (Woodcut No.257) resemble in the
plaster design ornaments found at Wurka.256, which represents the façade of the
South Palace, the openings of the ground storey are spanned by arches of
two different forms; and those of the upper storey by lintels carried on
corbels with relieving arch over; the latter a Byzantine treatment; the
former of a very much later date, and probably Saracenic: above the
openings and under the frieze are Cufic inscriptions.On the whole there
seems little doubt that the building we now see was erected, as it now
stands, at the age of the Cufic inscriptions,[203] whatever they may be,
but that the remains of some more ancient edifice was most skilfully
worked up in the new.Till, however, the building is carefully examined
by some thoroughly competent person, this must remain doubtful.The
building is rich, and so interesting that it is to be hoped that its
history and peculiarities will before long be investigated.Façade of South Palace at Diarbekr.]With the accession of the Sassanians, A.D.223, Persia regained much of
that power and stability to which she had been so long a stranger.The
capture of the Roman Emperor Valerian by the 2nd king of the race, A.D.260, the Conquest of Armenia and victories over Galerius by the 7th
(A.D.296), and the exploits of the 14th King, Bahram Gaur, his visit to
India and his alliance with its kings, all point to extended power
abroad; while the improvement in the fine arts at home indicates
returning prosperity and a degree of security unknown since the fall of
the Achæmenidæ.These kings seem to have been of native race, and claimed descent from
the older dynasties: at all events they restored the ancient religion
and many of the habits and customs with which we are familiar as
existing before the time of Alexander the Great.View in the Court of the Great Mosque at Diarbekr.]As before remarked, fire-worship does not admit of temples, and we
consequently miss that class of buildings which in all ages best
illustrates the beauties of architecture; and it is only in a few
scattered remains of palaces that we are able to trace the progress of
the style.Such as they are, they indicate considerable originality and
power, but at the same time point to a state of society when attention
to security hardly allowed the architect the free exercise of the more
delicate ornaments of his art.The Sassanians took up the style where it was left by the builders of Al
Hadhr; but we only find it after a long interval of time, during which
changes had taken place which altered it to a considerable extent, and
made it in fact into a new and complete style.They retained the great tunnel-like halls of Al Hadhr, but only as
entrances.They cut bold arches through the dividing walls, so as to
form them into lateral suites.But, above all, they learnt to place
domes on the intersections of their halls, not resting on drums, but on
pendentives,[204] and did not even attempt to bring down simulated lines
of support to the ground.Besides all these constructive peculiarities,
they lost all trace of Roman detail, and adopted a system of long
reed-like pilasters, extending from the ground to the cornice, below
which they were joined by small semicircular arches.They in short
adopted all the peculiarities which are found in the Byzantine style as
carried out at a later age in Armenia and the East.We must know more of
this style, and be able to ascribe authentic dates to such examples as
we are acquainted with, before we can decide whether the Sassanians
borrowed the style from the Eastern Romans, or whether they themselves
were in fact the inventors from whom the architects of the more western
nations took the hints which they afterwards so much improved upon.The various steps by which the Romans advanced from the construction of
buildings like the Pantheon to that of the church of Sta.Sophia at
Constantinople are so consecutive and so easily traced as to be
intelligible in themselves without the necessity of seeking for any
foreign element which may have affected them.If it really was so, and
the architecture of Constantinople was not influenced from the East, we
must admit that the Sassanian was an independent and simultaneous
invention, possessing characteristics well worthy of study.It is quite
certain too that this style had a direct influence on the Christian and
Moslem styles of Asia, which exhibit many features not derivable from
any of the more Western styles.Section on line A B of Palace at Serbistan.A few examples will render this clearer than it can be made in words.258 and 259) of a small but
interesting palace at Serbistan will explain most of the peculiarities
of the style.The entrances, it will be observed, are deep tunnel-like
arches, but the centre is covered by a dome resting on pendentives.In
the palace of Firouzabad these are constructed by throwing a series of
arches across the angles, one recessed behind the other, the lower ones
serving as centres for those above, until a circular base for the dome
has been obtained; but here in Serbistan they do not seem to have known
this expedient: the lower courses run through to the angle, and the
upper ones are brought forward in so irregular and unscientific a way as
to suggest that for their support they placed their reliance almost
entirely on the tenacious qualities of the mortar.That which, however,
would have formed the outer arch of the pendentive is wrought on the
stone down almost to the springing, as if the builder of Serbistan had
seen regular arched pendentives of some kind, but did not know how to
build them.This is the more remarkable because, as we shall see later
on, they knew how to construct semi-domes over their recesses or square
niches, and in regular coursed masonry; if they had applied these to the
angles, they would have invented the squinch, a kind of pendentive
employed in Romanesque work in the south of France.The dome is
elliptical, as are also the barrel vaults over the entrances, the
recesses in the central hall, and the vaults over the lateral halls.In
these lateral halls piers are built within the walls, forming a series
of recesses; these either have transverse arches thrown across them
where the lofty doorways come, or are covered with semidomes in regular
coursed masonry, the angles being filled in below them with small
arches.The lower portions of the piers consist of circular columns
about six feet high, behind which a passage is formed.The builders thus
obtained the means of counteracting the thrust of the vault, without
breaking the external outline by buttresses and without occupying much
room on the floor, while at the same time these projections added
considerably to the architectural effect of the interior.The date of
the building is not correctly known, but it most probably belongs to the
age of Shapour, in the middle of the fourth century.The palace at Firouzabad is probably a century more modern, and is
erected on a far more magnificent scale, being in fact the typical
building of the style, so far at least as we at present know.(From Flandin and Coste.)]As will be seen in the plan, the great central entrance opens laterally
into two side chambers, and the inner of these into a suite of three
splendid domed apartments, occupying the whole width of the building.Beyond this is an inner court, surrounded by apartments all opening upon
it.261, representing one of the
doorways in the domed halls, the details have nothing Roman about them,
but are borrowed directly from Persepolis, with so little change that
the style, so far as we can now judge, is almost an exact reproduction,
except that the work is only surface ornament in plaster, and is an
irregular and a degraded copy of the original stone features at
Persepolis.The opening also is spanned by a circular arch under the
lintel of the Persian example, the former being the real constructive
feature, the latter a decorative imitation.The portion of the exterior
represented in Woodcut No.262 tells the same tale, though for its
prototype we must go back still further to the ruins at Wurka—the
building called Wuswus at that place (see p.165) being a palace
arranged very similarly to these, and adorned externally by panellings
and reeded pilasters, differing from these buildings only in detail and
arrangement, but in all essentials so like them as to prove that the
Sassanians borrowed most of their peculiarities from earlier native
examples.The building itself is a perfectly regular parallelogram, 332 ft.by
180, without a single break, or even an opening of any sort, except the
one great arch of the entrance; and externally it has no ornament but
the repetition of the tall pilasters and narrow arches represented in
Woodcut No.Its aspect is thus simple and severe, but more like a
gigantic Bastile than the palace of a gay, pavilion-loving people, like
the Persians.Internally the arrangement of the halls is simple and appropriate, and,
though somewhat too formal, is dignified and capable of considerable
architectural display.On the whole, however, its formality is perhaps
less pleasing than the more picturesque arrangements of the palace at
Serbistan last described.Part of External Wall, Firouzabad.Another century probably elapsed before Khosru (Nushirvan) commenced the
most daring, though certainly not the most beautiful ever attempted by
any of his race; for to him we must ascribe the well-known Tâk Kesra
(Woodcuts Nos.263, 264), the only important ruin that now marks the
site of the Ctesiphon of the Greeks—the great Modain of the Arabian
conquerors.As it is, it is only a fragment of a palace, a façade similar in
arrangement to that at Firouzabad, but on a much larger scale, its width
being 312 ft., its height 105 to 110, and the depth of the remaining
block 170 ft.In the centre is a magnificent portal, the Aiwan, or
Throne room of the palace, vaulted over with an elliptical barrel vault
and similar to the smaller vestibules of Serbistan and Firouzabad; the
lower portion of the arch, the springing of which is about 40 ft.from
the ground, is built in horizontal courses up to 63 ft.above the
ground, above which comes the portion arched with regular voussoirs; by
this method not only was an enormous centering saved, but the thrust of
that portion built with voussoirs was brought well within the thickness
of the side walls.It is probable that the front portion of the arch,
about 20 ft.in depth, was built on walls erected temporarily for that
purpose; the remainder of the vault, however, was possibly erected
without centres, the bricks being placed flatwise and the rings being
inclined at an angle of about 10° towards the back of the front arch.The tenacious quality of the mortar was probably sufficient to hold the
bricks in their places till the arch ring was complete, so that the
centering was virtually a template only, giving the correct form of the
ellipse, and constructed with small timbers so as to save expense.A
similar method of construction was found by Sir Henry Layard in the
drain vaults at Nimroud, and it exists in the granaries built by Rameses
II.in the rear of the Rameseum at Thebes.The lower or inner portion of
the great arch is built in four rings of bricks or tiles laid flatwise,
two of which are carried down to the springing of the whole arch: above
these in the upper portion of the arch comes a ring 3 feet in height,
regularly built in voussoir-shaped bricks breaking joint, on the surface
of which are cut a series of seventeen foils, the whole being crowned by
a slightly projecting moulding.These have nothing to do with the
construction, and are simply a novel method of decoration carved after
the arch was built.Plan of Tâk Kesra at Ctesiphon.(From Flandin and
Coste.)Elevation of Great Arch of Tâk Kesra at Ctesiphon.The wall flanking the great arch on either side is decorated with
buttress shafts and blind arches, which are partially constructive, and
intended to support and strengthen those portions of the wall which were
simply screens, or to resist the thrust of the walls of the vaulted
chambers behind, consisting of one storey only.Decoratively they divide
up the front and were apparently introduced in imitation of the great
Roman amphitheatres.The position occupied by these semi-detached shafts
on the first storey (resting on the ledge left by the greater thickness
of wall of the lower storey), which are not in the axes of those below,
proves that the Sassanian architect thought more of their constructive
value as buttresses, than of their architectural value as superimposed
features.Sketch Plan of Palace at Mashita.]Though it may not perhaps be beautiful, there is certainly something
grand in a great vaulted entrance, 72 ft.in height and
115 in depth, though it makes the doorway at the inner end and all the
adjoining parts look extremely small.It would have required the rest of
the palace to be carried out on an unheard-of scale to compensate for
this defect.The Saracenic architects got over the difficulty by making
the great portal a semidome, and by cutting it up with ornaments and
details, so that the doorway looked as large as was required for the
space left for it.Here, in the parent form, all is perfectly plain in
the interior, and painting alone could have been employed to relieve its
nakedness, which, however, it never would have done effectually.[205]

The ornaments in these and in all the other buildings of the Sassanians
having been executed in plaster, we should hardly be able to form an
idea of the richness of detail they once possessed but for the fortunate
discovery of a palace erected in Moab by Khosru Purviz, the last great
monarch of this line.[206]

As will be seen from the woodcut (No.265), the whole building is a
square, measuring above 500 ft.each way, but only the inner portion of
it, about 170 ft.square, marked E E, has been ever finished or
inhabited.It was apparently originally erected as a hunting-box on the
edge of the desert for the use of the Persian king, and preserves all
the features we are familiar with in Sassanian palaces.It is wholly in
brick, and contains in the centre a triapsal hall, once surmounted by a
dome on pendentives like those at Serbistan or Firouzabad.On either
side were eight vaulted halls with intermediate courts almost identical
with those found at Eski Bagdad[207] or at Firouzabad.So far there is
nothing either remarkable or interesting, except the peculiarity of
finding a Persian building in such a situation, and in the fact that the
capitals of the pillars are of that full-curved shape which are first
found in the works of Justinian, which so far helps to fix the date of
the building.It seems, however, that at a time when Chosroes possessed all Asia and
part of Africa, from the Indus to the Nile, and maintained a camp for
ten years on the shores of the Bosphorus, in sight of Constantinople,
that this modest abode no longer sufficed for the greatest monarch of
the day.He consequently determined to add to it the enclosure above
described, and to ornament it with a portal which should exceed in
richness anything of the sort to be found in Syria.Unfortunately for
the history of art, this design was never carried out.When the walls
were raised to the height of about twenty feet, the workmen were called
off, most probably in consequence of the result of the battle of Nineveh
in 627; and the stones remain half hewn, the ornament unfinished, and
the whole exactly as if left in a panic, never to be resumed.Interior of ruined triapsal Hall of Palace.]The length of the façade—marked A A in plan, Woodcut No.265—between the
plain towers, which are the same all round, is about 170 ft.,[208] the
centre of which was occupied by a square-headed portal flanked by two
octagonal towers.Each face of these towers was ornamented by an
equilateral triangular pediment, filled with the richest sculpture.267, two large animals are represented facing
one another on the opposite sides of a vase, on which are two doves, and
out of which springs a vine which spreads over the whole surface of the
triangle, interspersed with birds and bunches of grapes.In another
panel one of the lions is represented with wings, evidently the last
lineal descendant of those found at Nineveh and Persepolis, and in all
are curious hexagonal rosettes, carved with a richness far exceeding
anything found in Gothic architecture, but which are found repeated with
very little variation in the Jaina temples of western India.One Compartment of Western Octagon Tower of the
Persian Palace at Mashita.]The wing walls of the façade are almost more beautiful than the central
part itself.As on the towers, the ornamentation consists of a series of
triangles filled with incised decorations and with rosettes in their
centres; while, as will be observed in Woodcut No.265, the decoration
in each panel is varied, and all are unfinished.The cornice only exists
at one angle, and the mortice stones never were inserted that were meant
to keep it in its place.Enough however remains to enable us to see
that, as a surface decoration, it is nearly unrivalled in beauty and
appropriateness.As an external form I know nothing like it.It is only
matched by that between the arches of the interior of Sta.Sophia at
Constantinople, which is so near it in age that they may be considered
as belonging to the same school of art.Part of West Wing Wall of External Façade of Palace
at Mashita.Elevation of External Façade of the Mashita, as
restored by the Author.]Notwithstanding the incomplete state in which this façade was left,
there does not seem much difficulty in restoring it within very narrow
limits of certainty.The elevation cannot have differed greatly from
that shown in Woodcut No.In the first place
there must have been a great arch over the entrance doorway—this is _de
rigueur_ in Sassanian art, and this must have been stilted or
horse-shoed, as without that it could not be made to fit on to the
cornice in the towers, and all the arches in the interior take, as I am
informed, that shape.Besides this there is at Takt-i-Gero[209] a
Sassanian arch of nearly the same age and equally classical in design,
which is, like this one, horse-shoed to the extent of one-tenth of its
diameter; and at Urgub, in Asia Minor, all the rock-cut excavations
which are of this or an earlier age have this peculiarity in a marked
degree.[210]

Above this, the third storey, is a repetition of the lowest, on half its
scale—as in the Tâk Kesra,—but with this difference, that here the
angular form admits of its being carried constructively over the great
arch, so that it becomes a facsimile of an apse at Murano near
Venice,[211] which is adorned with the spoils of some desecrated
building of the same age, probably of Antioch or some city of Syria
destroyed by the Saracens.Above this the elevation is more open to
conjecture, but it is evident that the whole façade could not have been
less than 90 ft.in height, from the fact that the mouldings at the base
(Woodcut No.265) are the mouldings of a Corinthian column of that
height, and no architect with a knowledge of the style would have used
such mouldings four and a half feet in height, unless he intended his
building to be of a height equal at least to that proportion.The domes
are those of Serbistan or of Amrith (Woodcut No.122); but such domes
are frequent in Syria before this age, and became more so afterwards.The great defect of the palace at Mashita as an illustration of
Sassanian art arises from the fact that, as a matter of course, Chosroes
did not bring with him architects or sculptors to erect this building.He employed the artists of Antioch or Damascus, or those of Syria, as he
found them.He traced the form and design of what he wanted, and left
them to execute it, and they introduced the vine—which had been the
principal “motif” in such designs from the time of Herod till the Moslem
invasion—and other details of the Byzantine art with which Justinian had
made them familiar from his buildings at Jerusalem, Antioch, and
elsewhere.Exactly the same thing happened in India six centuries later.When the Moslems conquered that country in the beginning of the
thirteenth century they built mosques at Delhi and Ajmere which are
still among the most beautiful to be found anywhere.The design and
outline are purely Saracenic, but every detail is Hindu, but, just as in
this case, more exquisite than anything the Moslems ever did afterwards
in that country.Though it thus stands almost alone, the discovery of this palace fills a
gap in our history such as no other building occupies up to the present
time.And when more, and more correct, details have been procured, it
will be well worthy of a monograph, which can hardly be attempted now
from the scanty materials available.Its greatest interest, however,
lies in the fact that all the Persian and Indian mosques were derived
from buildings of this class.The African mosques were enlargements of
the _atria_ of Christian basilicas, and this form is never found there,
but it is the key to all that was afterwards erected to the eastward.The palace of Rabbath Ammon (Woodcuts Nos.270, 271), also in Moab,
consists of a central court open to the sky, and four recesses or
transepts, one on each face; two of these are covered with elliptical
barrel vaults, and two with semidomes carried on pendentives.The
decoration of this palace is similar to that found at Mashita, but not
so rich in design or so good in its execution.The remains of two other palaces have been found in Persia, one at
Imumzade, which consists of a dome on pendentives, and a second, called
the Tag Eiran, made known to us by M. Dieulafoy, and published in his
work on the ancient art of Persia.[212] The latter is probably a late
example, for it shows a considerable advance in construction, and is
lighted by clerestory windows between the brick transverse arches which
span the hall.The plan consisted of a central hall, covered over by a
dome carried on pendentives, and two wings; of the original building,
only one of these wings remains, and two sides of the central hall, in
both cases up to the springing of the real arch, the lower courses being
horizontal as in the arch at Ctesiphon.Arch of Chosroes at Takt-i-Bostan.(From Flandin and
Coste.)]In the dearth of Sassanian buildings there is one other monument that it
is worth while quoting before closing this chapter.It is an archway or
grotto, which the same Chosroes cut in the rock at Takt-i-Bostan, near
Kermanshah (Woodcut No.Though so far removed from Byzantine
influence it is nearly as classical as the palace at Mashita.The flying
figures over the arch are evident copies of those adorning the triumphal
arches of the Romans, the mouldings are equally classical, and though
the costumes of the principal personages, and of those engaged in the
hunting scenes on either hand, partake more of Assyria than of Rome, the
whole betrays the influence of his early education and the diffusion of
Western arts at that time more than any other monument we know of.The
statue of Chosroes on his favourite black steed “Shubz diz,” is original
and interesting, and, with many of the details of this monument, it has
been introduced into the restoration of Mashita.This, it must be confessed, is but a meagre account of the architecture
of a great people.Perhaps it may be that the materials do not exist for
making it more complete; but what is more likely is that they have not
yet been looked for, but will be found when attention is fairly directed
to the subject.In the meanwhile what has been said regarding it will be
much clearer and better understood when we come to speak of the
Byzantine style, which overlapped the Sassanian, and was to some extent
contemporary with it.If a line were drawn north and south from Memel on the shores of the
Baltic to Spalato on the Adriatic, it would divide Europe into nearly
equal halves.All that part lying to the west of the line would be found
to be inhabited by nations of Celtic or Teutonic races, and all those to
the eastward of it by nations of Sclavonic origin, if—as we must do—we
exclude from present consideration those fragments of the effete
Turanian races which still linger to the westward, as well as the
intrusive hordes of the same family which temporarily occupy some fair
portions to the eastward of the line so drawn.This line is not of course quite straight, for it follows the boundary
between Germany on the one hand, and Russia and Poland on the other as
far as Cracow, while it crosses Hungary by the line of the Raab and
separates Dalmatia from Turkey.Though Sclavonic influences may be
detected to the westward of the boundary, they are faint and underlie
the Teutonic element; but to the eastward, the little province of
Siebenburgen, in the north-east corner of Hungary, forms the only little
oasis of Gothic art in the desert of Panslavic indifference to
architectural expression.Originally it was a Roman, afterwards a
German, colony, and maintained its Gothic style throughout the Middle
Ages.[213]

From Spalato the line crosses the Adriatic to Fermo, and then following
very closely the 43rd parallel of latitude, divides Italy into two
nearly equal halves.Barbarian tribes settled to a certain extent to the
northward of this boundary and influenced the style of architecture in
some degree; while to the southward of it, their presence can with
difficulty be detected, except in a few exceptional cases, and for a
very limited time.Architecturally all the styles of art practised during the Middle Ages
to the westward and northward of this boundary may be correctly and
graphically described as the Gothic style, using this term in a broad
sense.All those to the eastward may with equal propriety be designated
as the Byzantine style of art.Anterior, however, to the former there existed a transitional style
known as Romanesque, but which was virtually at first nothing more than
debased Roman.It was, in fact, a modification of the classical Roman
form which was introduced between the reigns of Constantine and
Justinian, and was avowedly an attempt to adapt classical forms to
Christian purposes.At first the materials of ancient buildings sufficed
for its wants, and if after the 4th century the style did not lapse into
absolute barbarism it was due to the influence which the Proto-Byzantine
style began to exert and to the magnificent works erected by Greek
artists at Parenzo and Grado in Dalmatia, at Ravenna, Milan, and even in
Rome herself.To the eastward of the line of demarcation the transition
was perfected under the reign of Justinian (A.D.527 to 564), when it
became properly entitled to the name of Byzantine.To the westward, in
Italy and the south of France, this first phase of the Romanesque
continued to be practised till the 6th or 7th centuries; but about that
time occurs an hiatus in the architectural history of Western Europe,
owing to the troubles which arose on the dissolution of the Roman Empire
and the irruption of the Barbarian hordes.When the art again
reappeared, it was strongly tinctured by Barbarian influences, and might
with propriety be designated the _Gothic style_, the essential
characteristic being that it is the architecture of a people differing
from the Romans or Italians in blood, and, it need hardly be added,
differing from them in a like ratio in their architectural conceptions.The term “Gothic,” however, is so generally adopted throughout Europe to
designate the style in which the intersecting vault with pointed arches
is the main characteristic, that to depart from it, even when subdivided
into round arched and pointed arched Gothic, would only lead to
confusion.It would therefore seem better to retain the nomenclature
usually employed in modern architectural works, and to class all the
phases of the transitional style between the Roman and the Gothic
periods under the broad title of Romanesque.This would include what we
have termed Early Christian——Lombardi——Rhenish——those phases of the
style which in Italy and France are influenced by Byzantine detail——the
pure Romanesque or Romance of the south of France——the Norman style in
Italy, Sicily, and the North of France, and——Saxon and Norman in our own
country.The attempt to restrict the term Romanesque within the confines
of the 6th and 7th centuries, which was formerly attempted, has proved
to be illusory, as it has never been recognised by any student of
architecture.At the same time it is not necessary to insist on the term
when describing its various phases, and when they are better known under
other terms.It is, however, of importance, when writing a general
history of all styles, to keep strictly to some definite system, and not
to adopt the nomenclature which has in some cases been given by persons
writing monographs of the style of their own particular country.The
Germans, for instance, are inclined to call the architecture of such
cathedrals as Spires, Worms, etc., by the absurd name of Byzantine,
though no features in them have ever been borrowed from the Eastern
capital, nor do they resemble the buildings of that part of Europe.The title Gothic, which was originally invented as a term of reproach,
and which was applied to the imaginary work of the western Barbarians
who at one time overthrew the western Empire and settled within its
limits, has no architectural or ethnological value, it being impossible
to point out any features, much less buildings, which the Goths
introduced, and which are not to be more correctly attributed to Roman
or Byzantine artists.If we except the tomb of Theodoric, all the works
in Ravenna are scarcely to be distinguished from the basilicas of the
Eastern Empire, and only embody such modifications as the material of
the country and a certain influence of debased Roman architecture in
Italy would naturally exert.The churches and thermæ which Theodoric is
said to have restored in Rome have no characteristics which are not
found in other buildings of the same class before his reign, and even in
Spain and the south of France, which was occupied more or less
continuously by the Visigoths for more than two centuries, there are no
features which they could claim to have invented.The term Gothic, therefore, is misplaced, but inasmuch as the Goths
never invented any style, there is not likely, if this fact is
recognised, to be any confusion in its adoption.The chief difficulty which presents itself in any attempt to classify
the work of the Romanesque and the Gothic styles is that of drawing a
line of demarcation between the two.It is not sufficient to take the
pointed arch, for in France a pointed arched barrel vault preceded the
round arched vault; and in the East, as we know, the pointed arch made
its appearance at a much earlier period: that characteristic, therefore,
must not be too rigidly insisted upon.Beyond this general classification, the use of local names, when
available, will always be found most convenient.First, the country, or
architectural province, in which an example is found should be
ascertained, so that its locality may be marked, and if possible with
the addition of a dynastic or regal name to point out its epoch.When
the outline is sufficiently marked, it may be convenient, as the French
do, to speak of the style of the 13th century[214] as applied to their
own country.The terms they use always seem to be better than 1st, or
2nd, Middle Pointed, or even “Geometric,” “Decorated,” or
“Perpendicular,” or such general names as neither tell the country nor
the age, nor even accurately describe the style, though when they have
become general it may seem pedantic to refuse to use them.The system of
using local, combined, and dynastic names has been followed in
describing all the styles hitherto enumerated in this volume, and will
be followed in speaking of those which remain to be described; and as it
is generally found to be so convenient, whenever it is possible it will
be adhered to.In order to carry out these principles, the division proposed for this
part of the subject is—

1st.To begin the history of Christian Art by tracing up the successive
developments of the earliest perfected style, the Byzantine, in the
countries lying to the eastward of the boundary line already defined.Owing to the greater uniformity of race, the thread of the narrative is
far more easily followed to the eastward than we shall find to the
westward of the line.The Byzantine empire remained one and undivided
during the Middle Ages; and from that we pass by an easy gradation to
Russia, where the style continued to be practised till Peter the Great
superseded it by introducing the styles of Western Europe.To treat of the early Christian style as it prevailed in Italy,
down to the age of Charlemagne, so long, in fact, as it remained a
debased Roman style influenced only by its connection with the Eastern
Empire.Continuing our description of the various phases of the style as
practised in Italy and in Istria and Dalmatia (the two countries with
which she was so intimately connected) down to the revival of classic
architecture: subdividing it into those sections which are suggested by
the predominant influence of Lombardic, Byzantine, or Gothic art, and
keeping as far as possible to a chronological sequence.To take up the Romanesque style in France, and to follow it through
its various phases whilst it was being gradually absorbed in the
predominant impetus given to its successor, the Gothic style, by the
adoption of the pointed arch in intersecting vaulting during the 12th
century, and then its subsequent development in succeeding centuries,
till it perished under Francis I.

If this arrangement is not quite logical, it is certainly convenient, as
it enables us to grasp the complete history of the style in the country
where most of the more important features were invented and perfected.Having once mastered the history of Gothic art in the country of its
birth, the sequence in which the other branches of the style are
followed become comparatively unimportant.The difficulty of arranging
them does not lie so much in the sequence as in the determination of
what divisions shall be considered as separate architectural provinces.In a handbook, subdivision could hardly be carried too far; in a
history, a wider view ought to be taken.On the whole, perhaps, the
following will best meet the true exigencies of the case:—

4th.Belgium and Holland should be taken up after France as a separate
province during the Middle Ages, while at the same time forming an
intermediate link between that country and Germany.Though not without important ethnographical distinctions, it will
be convenient to treat all the German-speaking countries from the Alps
to the Baltic as one province.If Germany were taken up before France,
such a mode of treatment would be inadmissible; but following the
history of the art in that country, it may be done without either
confusion or needless repetition.Scandinavia follows naturally as a subordinate, and, unfortunately,
not very important, architectural subdivision.From this we pass by an easy gradation to the British Islands,
which in themselves contain three tolerably well-defined varieties of
style, popularly known as the Saxon, the Norman, or round-arched, and
the Gothic, or pointed-arched style of Architecture.Spain might have been made to follow France, as most of its
architectural peculiarities were borrowed from that country; but some
too own a German origin, while on the whole the new lessons to be
learned from a study of her art are so few, that it is comparatively
unimportant in what sequence the country is taken, and therefore it has
been found more convenient to place her last.BOOK I.

The term Byzantine has of late years been so loosely and incorrectly
used—especially by French writers on architecture—that it is now
extremely difficult to restrict it to the only style to which it really
belongs.Wherever a certain amount of  decoration is employed,
or a peculiar form of carving found, the name Byzantine is applied to
churches on the Rhine or in France; although no similar ornaments are
found in the Eastern Empire, and though no connection can be traced
between the builders of the Western churches and the architects of
Byzantium, or the countries subject to her sway.Strictly speaking, the term ought only to be applied to the style of
architecture which arose in Byzantium and the East after Constantine
transferred the government of the Roman Empire to that city.It is
especially the style of the Greek Church as contradistinguished from
that of the Roman Church, and ought never to be employed for anything
beyond its limits.The only obstacle to confining it to this definition
occurs between the ages of Constantine and Justinian.Up to the reign of
the last-named monarch the separation between the two churches was not
complete or clearly defined, and the architecture was of course likewise
in a state of transition, sometimes inclining to one style, sometimes to
the other.After Justinian’s time, the line may be clearly and sharply
drawn, and it would therefore be extremely convenient if the term “Greek
architecture” could be used for the style of the Greek Church from that
time to the present day.If that term be inadmissible, the term “Sclavonic” might be applied,
though only in the sense in which the Gothic style could be designated
as Teutonic.Both, however, imply ethnographic distinctions which it
would not be easy to sustain.The term “Gothic” happily avoids these,
and so would “Greek,” but for the danger of its being confounded with
“Grecian,” which is the proper name for the classical style of the
ancient Greeks.If the employment of either of these terms is deemed
inadvisable, it will be necessary to divide the style into Old and New
Byzantine—the first comprehending the three centuries of transition that
elapsed from Constantine to the Persian war of Heraclius and the rise of
the Mahomedan power, which entirely changed the face of the Eastern
Empire,—the second, or Neo-Byzantine, including all those forms which
were practised in the East from the reappearance of the style, in or
after the 8th century, till it was superseded by the Renaissance.Thus divided, the true or old Byzantine style might be regarded as the
counterpart of the early Romanesque or debased Roman style, except that,
owing to the rapid development in the East, the former culminated in the
erection of Sta.532-558); the Eastern Empire thus forming
a style of its own of singular beauty and perfection, which it left to
its Sclavonic successors to use or abuse as their means or tastes
dictated.The Western Empire, on the contrary, was in a state of decay
ending in a _débâcle_, from which the Romanesque style only partially
emerged during the reign of Charlemagne and his successors with a new
revival in the 11th century.Though the styles of the East and the West became afterwards so
distinctly separate, we must not lose sight of the fact, that during the
age of transition (324-622) no clear line of demarcation can be traced.Constantinople, Rome, and Ravenna were only principal cities of one
empire, throughout the whole of which the people were striving
simultaneously to convert a Pagan into a Christian style, and working
from the same basis with the same materials.[215] Prior to the age of
Constantine one style pervaded the whole empire.The buildings at
Palmyra, Jerash, or Baalbec, are barely distinguishable from those of
the capital, and the problem of how the Pagan style could be best
converted to Christian uses was the same for all.The consequence is,
that if we were at present writing a history which stopped with the
beginning of the 7th century, the only philosophical mode of treating
the question would be to consider the style as one and indivisible for
that period; but as the separation was throughout steadily, though
almost imperceptibly, making its way, and gradually became fixed and
permanent, it will be found more convenient to assume the separation
from the beginning.This method will no doubt lead to some repetition,
but that is a small inconvenience compared with the amount of clearness
obtained.At the same time, if any one were writing a history of
Byzantine architecture only, it would be necessary to include Ravenna,
and probably Venice and some other towns in Italy and Sicily, in the
Eastern division.On the other hand, in a history devoted exclusively to
the Romanesque styles, it would be impossible to omit the churches at
Jerusalem, Bethlehem, or Thessalonica, and elsewhere in the East.Under
these circumstances, it is necessary to draw an arbitrary line
somewhere; and for this purpose the western limits of the Turkish Empire
and of Russia will answer every practical purpose.Eastward of this line
every country in which the Christian religion at any time prevailed may
be considered as belonging to the Byzantine province.During the first three centuries of the style (324-622) it will be
convenient to consider the whole Christian East as one architectural
province.When our knowledge is more complete, it may be possible to
separate it into several, but at present we are only beginning to see
the steps by which the style grew up, and are still very far from the
knowledge requisite for such limitations, even if it should hereafter be
discovered that a sufficient number exist.All the great churches with
which Constantine and his immediate successors adorned their new capital
have perished.Like the churches at Jerusalem and Bethlehem, they were
probably constructed with wooden roofs and even wooden architraves, and
thus soon became a prey to the flames in that most combustible of
capitals.Christian architecture has been entirely swept off the face of
the earth at Antioch, and very few and imperfect vestiges are found of
the seven churches of Asia Minor.Still, the recent researches of De
Vogüé in Northern Syria,[216] and of Texier in Thessalonica[217] show
how much unexpected wealth still remains to be explored, and in a few
years more this chapter of our history may assume a shape as much more
complete than what is now written, as it excels what we were compelled
to be content with when the Handbook was published, 1855.Since therefore, under present circumstances, no ethnographic treatment
of the subject seems feasible, the clearest mode of presenting it will
probably be to adopt one purely technical.For this purpose it will be found convenient, first, to separate the
Neo-Byzantine style from the older division, which, in order not to
multiply terms, may be styled the Byzantine _par excellence_; the first
chapter extending from Constantine, 324, to the Hejira, 622; and the
second from that time to the end of the Middle Ages.In reference to the ecclesiastical architecture of the first division,
it is proposed to treat—

First, of churches of the basilican or rectangular forms, subdividing
them into those having wooden, and those having stone roofs.Secondly, to describe circular churches in the same manner, subdividing
them similarly into those with wooden roofs, and those with stone roofs
or true domes.This subdivision will not be necessary in speaking of the Neo-Byzantine
churches, since they all have stone roofs and true domes.With regard to civil or domestic architecture very little can at present
be said, as so little is known regarding it, but we may hope that, a few
years hence, materials will exist for an interesting chapter on even
this branch of the subject.Churches at Bethlehem, Jerusalem, and Thessalonica—Rectangular Churches
  in Syria and Asia Minor, with wooden roofs and stone vaults.Basilicas may be subdivided into two classes—that in which the nave is
divided from the side-aisles by pillars, carrying either entablatures or
arches, as the most purely Romanesque—and that which has piers
supporting arches only, and is transitional between the first style and
the more original forms which were elaborated out of it.Of the former class one of the most authentic and perfect is that
erected at Bethlehem by Helena, the mother of Constantine, in front of
the cave of the Nativity.The nave seems to be a nearly unaltered
example of this age, with the advantage over the contemporary churches
at Rome, that all its pillars and their capitals were made for the
places they occupy, whereby the whole possesses a completeness and
justness of proportion not found in the metropolis.Its dimensions,
though sufficient for effect, are not large, being internally 103 ft.The choir with its three apses does
not seem to be part of the original arrangement, but to have been added
by Justinian when he renovated—Eutychius says rebuilt—the church.My
impression is that a detached circular building, external to the
basilica, originally contained the entrance to the cave.The frescoes
were added apparently in the 11th or 12th century.[218]

One of the principal points of interest connected with this church is,
that it enables us to realise the description Eusebius gives us of the
basilica which Constantine erected at Jerusalem in honour of the
Resurrection.Like this church it was five-aisled, but had galleries;
the apse also was on a larger scale than could well have been possible
in the Bethlehem church, and adorned with twelve pillars, symbolical of
the Apostles.Of this building nothing now remains, and the only portion which could
be claimed as part of Constantine’s work is the western wall of the
Rotunda, which to a height of 15 to 20 ft.was cut out of the solid rock
in order to isolate the Holy Sepulchre in the centre.The so-called
tombs of Absalom and Zachariah in the valley of Jehoshaphat were
detached in a similar way from the rock behind them.[219]


                             THESSALONICA.Eski Djuma, Thessalonica.As before mentioned, it is to Constantinople, or Alexandria, or Antioch,
that we should naturally look to supply us with examples of the style of
the early transition, but as these fail, it is to Thessalonica alone—in
so far as we now know—that we can turn.In that city there are two
ancient examples.One, now known as the Eski Djuma or old mosque
(Woodcut No.274), may belong to the 5th century, though there are no
very exact data by which to fix its age.It consists of a nave,
measuring, exclusive of narthex and bema, 93 ft.across by 120 ft.—very
much the proportion of the Bethlehem church, but having only three
aisles, the centre one 48 ft.Demetrius, is larger, but less simple.It is five-aisled, has two
internal transepts, and various adjuncts.Altogether it seems a
considerable advance towards the more complicated form of a Christian
church.Both these churches have capacious galleries, running above the
side aisles, and probably devoted to the accommodation of the women.Demetrius is most probably among the first years of the
sixth century.[220] The general ordinance of the columns will be
understood from the woodcut (No.Generally they are placed on
elevated square or octagonal bases, or pedestals, as in the tepidaria of
the Thermæ in Rome, and all have a block (known as the dosseret), placed
above the capital, which is supposed to represent the entablature of the
Roman example, but is probably an original feature inserted over the
capital to support the springing of the arch.In this form it is found
very generally in the 5th and 6th centuries, after which it fell into
disuse, an increased depth being given to the abacus of the capital to
take its place.Demetrius at Thessalonica, A.D.So far as we now know, there is only one church of this class at
Constantinople—that known as St.John Studius,—a three-aisled basilica,
125 ft.Its date appears to be tolerably
well ascertained as A.D.463, and from this circumstance, as well as its
being in the metropolis, it shows less deviation from the classical type
than the provincial examples just quoted.The lower range of columns
supporting the gallery still retain the classical outline and support a
horizontal entablature (Woodcut No.277); the upper supporting arches
have very little resemblance to the classical type, and are wanting in
the architrave block or dosseret, which in fact never seems to have been
admired in the capital.The country where—so far at least as we at present know—the Byzantine
Basilica was principally developed was Northern Syria.Already in De
Vogüé’s work on Central Syria some dozen churches are indicated having
the aisles divided from the naves by pillars supporting arches.One of
these only—that at Soueideh—has five aisles, all the rest three.Almost
all have plain semicircular apses, sometimes only seen internally, like
those mentioned further on (page 510), but sometimes also projecting, as
was afterwards universally the fashion.Two at least have square
terminations (Kefr Kileh and Behioh), but this seems exceptional.Most
of them are almost the size of our ordinary parish churches—100 ft.by
60 or thereabouts—and all belong to the three centuries—the 4th, 5th,
and 6th—of which this chapter especially treats.The church at Baquoza may serve as a type of the class both in plan and
section (Woodcuts Nos.by 105; and besides the narthex—not shown in the section—it has four
lateral porches.It has also two square chapels or vestries at the end
of the aisles—an arrangement almost universal in these churches.The most remarkable of the group, however, is that of St.Simeon
Stylites, at Kalat Sema’n, about 20 miles east of Antioch.Its
dimensions are very considerable, being 330 ft.long, north and south,
and as nearly as may be, 300 ft.east and west, across what may be
called the transepts.The centre is occupied by a great octagon, 93 ft.across, on a rock in the centre of which the pillar of that eccentric
saint originally stood.This apparently was never roofed over, but stood
always exposed to the air of heaven.[221]

[Illustration: 278.Plan of Church and Part of Monastic Buildings at
Kalat Sema’n.The greater part of the conventual buildings belonging to this church
still remain in a state of completeness,—a fact which will be startling
to those who are not aware how many of the great religious
establishments of Syria still stand entire, wanting only the roofs,
which were apparently the only parts constructed of wood.The whole of the buildings at Kalat Sema’n seem to have been completed
within the limits of the 5th century, and not to have been touched or
altered since they were deserted, apparently in consequence of the
Mahomedan irruption in the 7th century.The most curious point is that
such a building should have remained so long in such a situation,
unknown to the Western world; for the notices hitherto published have
been meagre and unsatisfactory in the extreme, and De Vogüé is only able
to state that it was visited and described by the historian Evagrius in
the year 560 A.D.In the same province we find also the earliest examples of the use of
pier arches in a church to separate the nave from the aisles.These seem
to have been currently used in Northern Syria in the 6th century, though
not found in the West—at least not used in the same manner—for several
centuries later.Generally three such arches only were employed in the
length of the nave, and they consequently left the floor so open and
free, that it is very questionable if in churches of limited dimensions
the introduction of a much larger number by the Gothic architects was an
improvement.Taking it altogether, it is probable that such a church as
that at Roueiha (Woodcut No.282) would, if literally reproduced, make a
better and cheaper church for an English parish than the Mediæval models
we are so fond of copying.A considerable amount of perspective effect
is obtained by throwing two transverse arches across the nave, dividing
it into three compartments, each including four windows in the
clerestory; and the whole design is simple and solid in a degree seldom
surpassed in buildings of its class.In many of these churches the transverse arches of the nave are omitted;
and when, as at Qalb Louzeh (Woodcut No.284), the clerestory is
accentuated by roofing shafts, the same effect of perspective is
obtained by other means, and perhaps as successfully.It is very
interesting, however, to find that as early as the 6th century the
architects were thoughtfully feeling their way towards those very
principles of design which many centuries afterwards enabled the Gothic
architects to produce their most successful effects.The introduction of
four windows over each great arch, and of a rooting-shaft between each
to support the beams of the roof, was a happy thought, and it is
wonderful it was so completely lost sight of afterwards.Plan of Church at Qalb Louzeh.Apse of Church at Qalb Louzeh.It is probable that the apse (Woodcut No.284) was originally adorned
with paintings or mosaics, or at least that it was intended it should be
so ornamented; but even as it is, it is so well proportioned to the size
of the church, and to its position, and so appropriately ornamented,
that it is better than most of those found in Roman basilicas; and, for
a small church, is a more dignified receptacle for the altar than either
the French chevet or the English chancel.Did our limits admit of it, it would be not only pleasant but
instructive to dwell longer on this subject; for few parts of our
inquiry can be more interesting than to find that, as early as the 6th
century, the Roman basilica had been converted into a Christian church,
complete in all its details, and—internally at least—in a style of
architecture as consistent and almost as far removed from its classical
prototype as the Mediæval Gothic itself.Externally, too, the style was becoming independent of classical models,
though hardly in the same degree.The porches of the churches were
generally formed in two storeys, the lower having a large central arch
of admission, the upper consisting of a colonnade which partially hid,
while it supported, an open screen of windows that admitted a flood of
light into the nave just in the position where it was most effective.Without glass or mullions such a range of windows must have appeared
weak, and would have admitted rain; but when sheltered by a screen of
pillars, it was both convenient and artistic.Elevation of Chapel at Babouda.This mode of lighting is better illustrated at Babouda, where it is
employed in its simplest form.No light is admitted to the chapel except
through one great semicircular window over the entrance, and this is
protected externally by a screen of columns.This mode of introducing
light, as we shall afterwards see, was common in India at this age, and
earlier, all the Chaitya caves being lighted in the same manner; and for
artistic effect it is equal, if not superior, to any other which has yet
been invented.The light is high, and behind the worshipper, and thrown
direct on the altar, or principal part of the church.In very large
buildings it could hardly be applied, but for smaller ones it is
singularly effective.The external effect of these buildings though not so original as the
interior, is still very far removed from the classical type, and
presents a variety of outline and detail very different from the
simplicity of a Pagan temple.One of the most complete is that at
Tourmanin (Woodcut No.287), though that at Qalb Louzeh is nearly as
perfect, but simpler in detail.For a church of the 6th century it is
wonderful how many elements of later buildings it suggests; even the
western towers seem to be indicated, and, except the four columns of the
gallery, there is very little to recall the style out of which it arose.Façade of Church at Tourmanin.There are considerable remains of a wooden-roofed basilica at Pergamus,
which may be even older than those just described; but having been built
in brick, and only faced with stone—the whole of which is gone—it is
difficult to feel sure of the character of its details and mouldings.It
had galleries on either side of the nave, but how these were supported
or framed is not clear.It may have been by wooden posts or marble
pillars, and these would have either decayed or been removed.The two
square calcidica or vestries, which in the Syrian churches terminate the
side-aisles, are here placed externally like transepts, and beyond them
are two circular buildings with domical roofs and square apses.What
their use was is, however, doubtful.In fact, we know so little of the
architecture of that age in Asia Minor that this building stands quite
exceptionally; and very little use can be made of it, either as throwing
light on other buildings, or as receiving illustration from their
peculiarities.But seeing how much has been effected in this direction
of late, we may fully hope that this state of isolation will not long
remain.One other church of the 4th century is known to exist—at Nisibin.It is
a triple church, the central compartment being the tomb of the founder,
the first Armenian bishop of the place.Though much ruined, it still
retains the mouldings of its doorways and windows as perfect as when
erected, the whole being of fine hard stone.These are identical in
style with the buildings of Diocletian at Spalato; and as their date is
well known, they will, when published, form a valuable contribution to
the information we now possess regarding the architecture of this
period.CHURCHES WITH STONE ROOFS.All the buildings above described—with the exception of the chapel at
Babouda—have wooden roofs, as was the case generally with the basilicas
and the temples of the classical age.The Romans, however, had built
temples with aisles and vaulted them as early as the age of Augustus, as
at Nîmes, for instance (Woodcut No.189), and they had roofed their
largest basilicas and baths with intersecting vaults.We should not
therefore feel surprised if the Christians sometimes attempted the same
thing in their rectangular churches, more especially as the dome was
always a favourite mode of roofing circular buildings; and the problem
which the Byzantine architects of the day set themselves to solve was—as
we shall presently see—how to fit a circular dome of masonry to a
rectangular building.One of the earliest examples of a stone-roofed church is that at Tafkha
in the Hauran.It is probably of the age of Constantine, though as
likely to be before his time as after it.Its date, however, is not of
very great importance, as its existence does not prove that the form was
adopted from choice by the Christians: the truth being that, in the
country where it is found, wood was never used as a building material.All the buildings, both domestic and public, are composed wholly of
stone—the only available material for the purpose which the country
afforded.In consequence of this, when that tide of commercial
prosperity which rose under the Roman rule flowed across the country
from the Euphrates valley to the Mediterranean, the inhabitants had
recourse to a new mode of construction, which was practically a new
style of architecture.This consisted in the employment of arches
instead of beams.These were placed so near one another that flat stones
could be laid side by side from arch to arch.Over these a layer of
concrete was spread, and a roof was thus formed so indestructible that
whole towns remain perfect to the present day, as originally constructed
in the first centuries of the Christian era.[222]

[Illustration: 289.Section on A B, Tafkha.Section on C D, Tafkha.]Half Front Elevation, Tafkha.One example must suffice to explain this curious mode of construction.The church at Tafkha is 50 ft.It is
spanned by four arches, 7 ft.On each side are galleries of
flat slabs resting on brackets, as shown in Woodcuts Nos.289, 291,
which again are supported by smaller transverse arches.At one side is a
tower, but this is roofed wholly by bracketing, as if the architect
feared the thrust of the arch even at that height.The defect of this arrangement as an architectural expedient is the
extreme frequency of the piers, 8 or 10 ft.being the greatest distance
practicable; but as a mechanical expedient it is singularly ingenious.More internal space is obtained with a less expenditure of material and
danger from thrust than from any mode of construction—wholly of
stone—that we are acquainted with; and with a little practice it might
no doubt be much improved upon.The Indian architects, as we shall
presently see, attempted the same thing, but set about it in a
diametrically opposite way.They absolutely refused to employ the arch
under any circumstances, but bracketed forward till the space to be
covered was so limited that a single stone would reach across.By this
means they were enabled to roof spaces 20 or 25 ft.span without arches,
which is about the interval covered with their aid at Tafkha.[223]

[Illustration: 293.Another circumstance which renders these Hauran examples interesting to
the architectural student is that they contain no trace or reminiscence
of wooden construction or adornment, so apparent in almost every other
style.In Egypt, in Greece, in India, in
Persia—everywhere, in fact—we can trace back the principal form of
decoration to a wooden original; here alone all is lithic, and it is
probably the only example of the sort that the whole history of
architecture affords.If there are any churches in the Byzantine province of the age of which
we are treating, whose naves are roofed by intersecting vaults, they
have not yet been described in any accessible work; but great
tunnel-vaults have been introduced into several with effect.One such is
found at Hierapolis, on the borders of Phrygia (Woodcut No.It is
divided by a bold range of piers into three aisles, the centre one
having a clear width of 45 ft.The internal dimensions of the
church are 177 ft.There are three great piers in the length,
which carry bold transverse ribs so as to break the monotony of the
vault, and have between them secondary arches, to carry the galleries.There is another church at the same place, the roof of which is of a
somewhat more complicated form.The internal length, 140 ft., is divided
into three by transverse arches; but its great peculiarity is that the
vault is cut into by semi-circular lunettes above the screen side-walls,
and through these the light is introduced.This arrangement will be
understood from the section (Woodcut No.Taken altogether, there
is probably no other church of its age and class in which the vault is
so pleasingly and artistically arranged, and in which the mode of
introducing the light is so judicious and effective.The age of these two last churches is not very well ascertained.They
probably belong to the 5th, and are certainly not later than the 6th,
century; but, before we can speak with certainty on the subject, more
examples must be brought to light and examined.From our present
knowledge it can hardly be doubted that a sufficient number do exist to
complete the chapter; and it is to be hoped they will be published,
since a history of vaults in the East, independent of domes, is still a
desideratum.CIRCULAR OR DOMICAL BUILDINGS.Circular Churches with wooden roofs and with true domes in Syria and
  Thessalonica—Churches of St.Sergius and Bacchus and Sta.Sophia,
  Constantinople—Domestic Architecture—Tombs.At the time of the erection of the churches described in the last
chapter, a circular domical style was being simultaneously elaborated in
the East, which not only gave a different character to the whole style,
but eventually entirely superseded the western basilican form, and
became an original and truly Byzantine art.Constantine is said to have erected a church at Antioch which, from the
description given by Eusebius, was octagonal in plan.On Mount Gerizim, on or near the site of the Samaritan temple, Justinian
built an octagonal church showing in its multifold chapels a
considerable advance towards Christian arrangements; it has, however
been so completely destroyed that only its foundation can now be traced,
from which the plan (Woodcut No.296) was measured and worked out by Sir
Charles Wilson.At Bosra in the Hauran there is a church of perfectly well-ascertained
date—A.D.512—which, when more completely illustrated, will throw
considerable light on the steps by which a Pagan temple was transformed
into a Christian church.It is a building externally square, but
internally circular (Woodcut No.in
diameter, and was evidently covered with a wooden roof, according to M.
de Vogüé, supported on eight piers.The interest of the plan consists in
its showing the progress made in adapting this form to Christian
purposes, and it is to be hoped that further investigation may enable us
to supply all the steps by which the transformation took place.De Vogüé
is of opinion that there was a central dome carried on piers and columns
similar to the church of SS.Sergius and Bacchus in Constantinople, with
aisles round and gallery over them, the latter covered with a timber
roof, the holes in which the rafters were fixed being still visible.Owing to want of lateral support the dome fell down, and at a later
period a small basilica church was erected within the enclosure in front
of the apse; the proximity of the piers of this church suggests that it
was covered with stone slabs according to the custom of the country.The
inscription over the principal entrance door states that the church was
dedicated to SS.Sergius and Bacchus, and was completed in the 400th
year of Bosra (511-512 A.D.).Another example exists at Kalat Sema’n, in
Northern Syria, and presents a combination of an octagonal with a
rectangular church very common in Armenia and Georgia.As is generally
the case there, they are very small in dimensions, the whole group only
measuring 120 ft.Their actual destination is not known, but M.
de Vogüé suggests that the triapsal arrangement in the octagonal
building points to its having been erected as a baptistery.This group
is situated about 200 yards from the main buildings illustrated in
Woodcut (No.Section of Double Church at Kalat Sema’n.Plan, Kalat Sema’n.Whether the dome of the Pantheon at Rome (p.320) was erected in the
time of the Antonines, or before the time of Augustus, as was formerly
supposed, it is evident that the Romans had conquered the difficulties
of domic construction long before the transference of the seat of power
to Byzantium; the Pantheon being, up to this hour, the largest (single)
dome ever constructed by the hand of man.Simple and grand as it
undoubtedly is, it had several glaring defects in its design which the
Byzantines set themselves to remedy.The first was that twice the
necessary amount of materials was consumed in its construction.The
second, that the mode of lighting by a hole in the roof, which also
admitted the rain and the snow, was most objectionable before the
invention of glass.The third, that a simply circular plan is always
unmeaning and inconvenient.A fourth, that a circular building can
hardly, by any contrivance, be made to fit on to any other buildings or
apartments.In the Minerva Medica (Woodcut No.229) great efforts were made, but not
quite successfully, to remedy these defects.The building would not fit
on to any others, and, though an improvement on the design of the
Pantheon, was still far from perfect.The first step the Byzantines made was to carry the dome on arches
resting on eight piers enclosing an octagon A (Woodcut No.300); this
enabled them to obtain increased space, to provide nave, choir, and
transepts, and by throwing out niches on the diagonal lines, virtually
to obtain a square hall in the centre.The difference between the
octagon and circle is so slight, that by corbelling out above the
extrados of the arches, a circular base for the dome was easily obtained
B. The next step was to carry the dome on arches resting on four piers,
and their triumph was complete when by the introduction of
pendentives—represented by the shaded parts at D (Woodcut No.301), they
were enabled to place the circular dome on a square compartment.The
pendentives and dome thus projected formed part of a sphere, the radius
of which was the half-diagonal of the square compartment.Constructively
it would probably have been easier to roof the space by an intersecting
vault; and even if of 100 or 150 ft.span it would without difficulty
have been effected.The difference between the intersecting vault and
the dome (as shown in Woodcuts 302 and 303; the former the tomb of Galla
Placidia, built 450 A.D., the latter the chapel of St.Peter Crysologus
attached to the archiepiscopal palace of about the same date, and both
in Ravenna) is perhaps the most striking contrast the history of
architecture affords between mechanical and ornamental construction.Both are capable of being ornamented to the same extent and in the same
manner; but the difference of form rendered the dome a beautiful object
in itself wholly irrespective of ornament, whereas the same cannot
always be said of the intersecting barrel vault.Altogether, the effect
would have been architecturally so infinitely inferior, that we cannot
but feel grateful to the Byzantines that they persevered, in spite of
all mechanical temptations, till they reached the wonderful perfection
of the dome of Sta.Tomb of Galla Placidia, Ravenna.Chapel in Archiepiscopal Palace, Ravenna.]Among the earliest domical churches found in the East is that of St.It is also, perhaps, the finest example of its
class belonging strictly to that group which has been designated above
as the Eastern Romanesque.As will be seen from the plan it is a circular apartment, 79 ft.in
diameter, surrounded by walls 20 ft.in thickness, into which are cut
seven great niches; two apparently serving as entrances, opposite one of
which is a bema or presbytery of considerable importance and purely
Christian form.The dome is hemispherical, pierced at its base by eight
semi-circular lunettes, and externally covered and concealed by a wooden
roof.This form of roof is first found in the West at Nocera dei Pagani
(p.547), but the dome there is only half the diameter of this one, and
of a very different form and construction.George’s
retains its internal decorations, which are among the earliest as well
as the most interesting Christian mosaics in existence.[224] The
architecture presented in them bears about the same relation to that in
the Pompeiian frescoes which the Jacobæan does to classical
architecture, and, mixed with Christian symbols and representations of
Christian saints, makes up a most interesting example of early Christian
decoration.(From
Texier and Pullan.)]No inscriptions or historical indications exist from which the date of
the church can be fixed.We are safe, however, in asserting that it was
erected by Christians, for Christian purposes, subsequently to the age
of Constantine.If we assume the year 400 as an approximate date we
shall probably not err to any great extent, though the real date may be
somewhat later.Plan of Kalybe at Omm-es-Zeitoun (Syria).How early a true Byzantine form of arrangement may have been introduced
we have no means of knowing; but as early as the year 285—according to
De Vogüé—we have a Kalybe[225] at Omm-es-Zeitoun, which contains all the
elements of the new style.It is square in plan, with a circular dome in
its centre for a roof.The wing walls which extend the façade are
curious, but not singular.One other example, at least, is found in the
Hauran, at Chaqqa, and there may be many more.View of Kalybe at Omm-es-Zeitoun.Still, in the Hauran they never seem quite to have fallen into the true
Byzantine system of construction, but preferred one less mechanically
difficult, even at the expense of crowding the floor with piers.In the
church at Ezra, for instance, the internal octagon is reduced to a
figure of sixteen sides before it is attempted to put a dome upon it,
and all thought of beauty of form, either internally or externally, is
abandoned in order to obtain mechanical stability—although the dome is
only 30 ft.As the date of this church is perfectly ascertained (510) it forms a
curious landmark in the style just anterior to the great efforts
Justinian was about to make, and which forced it so suddenly into its
greatest, though a short-lived, degree of perfection.As before mentioned, all the churches of the capital which were erected
before the age of Justinian, have perished, with the one exception of
that of St.This may in part be
owing to the hurried manner in which they were constructed, and the
great quantity of wood consequently employed, which might have risked
their destruction anywhere.It is, however, a curious, but
architecturally an important, fact that Byzantium possessed every
conceivable title to be chosen as the capital of the Empire, except the
possession of a good building-stone, or even apparently any suitable
material for making good bricks.Wood seems in all times to have been
the material most readily obtained and most extensively used for
building purposes, and hence the continual recurrence of fires, from
before the time of Justinian down to the present day.That monarch was
the first who fairly met the difficulty; the two churches erected during
his reign, which now exist, are constructed wholly without wood or
combustible materials of any sort—and hence their preservation.The earliest of these two, popularly known as the “Kutchuk Agia Sophia,”
or lesser Sta.Sophia, was originally a double church, or more properly
speaking two churches placed side by side, precisely in the same manner
as the two at Kalat Sema’n (Woodcut No.The basilica was dedicated
to the Apostles Peter and Paul; the domical church, appropriately, to
the Martyrs Sergius and Bacchus.The former has entirely disappeared,
from which I would infer that it was constructed with pillars and a
wooden roof.[226] The latter remains very nearly intact.The frescoes
and mosaics have, indeed, disappeared from the body of the church,
hidden, it is to be hoped, under the mass of whitewash which covers its
walls—in the narthex they can still be distinguished.The existing church is nearly square in plan, being 109 ft.by 92 over
all, exclusive of the apse, and covering only about 10,000 sq.It
has consequently no pretensions to magnificence on the score of
dimensions, but is singularly elegant in design and proportion.Internally, the arrangement of the piers of the dome, of the galleries,
and of the pillars which support them, are almost identical with those
of St.Vitale at Ravenna, but the proportions of the Eastern example are
better, being 66 ft.in height by 52 in diameter, while the other, with
the same diameter, is nearly 20 ft.higher, and consequently too tall to
be pleasing.The details of this church are generally well designed for the purposes
to which they are applied.There is a certain reminiscence of classical
feeling in the mouldings and foliage—in the latter, however, very faint.313) here seems almost to have superseded the
capital, and what was once a classical entablature has retained very
little of its pristine form (No.314), and indeed was used
constructively only, for the support of a gallery, or some such
mechanical requirement.The arch had entirely superseded it as an
ornamental feature long before the age of Justinian.Although the building just described, and others that might be quoted,
probably contain the germs of all that is found in Sta.Sophia, they are
on so small a scale that it is startling to find Justinian attempting an
edifice so grand, and so daring in construction, without more experience
than he appears to have obtained.Indeed so exceptional does this great
structure appear, with our present knowledge, that we might almost feel
inclined at first sight to look upon it as the immediate creation of the
individual genius of its architect, Anthemius of Thralles; but there can
be little doubt that if a greater number of contemporary examples
existed we should be able to trace back every feature of the design to
its origin.The scale, however, on which it was carried out was
certainly original, and required great boldness on the part of the
architect to venture upon such a piece of magnificence.At all events,
the celebrated boast of its founder on contemplating his finished work
was more than justified.When Justinian exclaimed, “I have surpassed
thee, O Solomon,” he took an exaggerated view of the work of his
predecessor, and did not realize the extent to which his building
excelled the Jewish temple.The latter was only equal to a small church
with a wooden roof supported by wooden posts, and covering some 7200 sq.Sophia covers ten times that area, is built of durable
materials throughout, and far more artistically ornamented than the
temple of the Jews ever could have been.But Justinian did more than
accomplish this easy victory.Neither the Pantheon nor any of the
vaulted halls at Rome equal the nave of Sta.Sophia in extent, or in
cleverness of construction, or in beauty of design.Nor was there
anything erected during the ten centuries which elapsed from the
transference of the capital to Byzantium till the building of the great
mediæval cathedrals which can be compared with it.Indeed it remains
even now an open question whether a Christian church exists anywhere, of
any age, whose interior is so beautiful as that of this marvellous
creation of old Byzantine art.Sophia which had been erected by Constantine
was, it seems, burnt to the ground in the fifth year of Justinian, A.D.532, when he determined to re-erect it on the same spot with more
magnificence and with less combustible materials.So rapidly were the
works pushed forward, that in six years it was ready for dedication,
A.D.Twenty years afterwards a portion of the dome fell down in
consequence of an earthquake; but this damage was repaired, and the
church re-dedicated, A.D.563, in the form, probably very nearly, in
which we now find it.In plan it closely approaches an exact square, being 235 ft.north and
south by 250 east and west, exclusive of the narthex and apse.The
narthex itself is a splendid hall, 205 ft.Beyond this there is an exo-narthex
which runs round the whole of the outer court, but this hardly seems to
be part of the original design.Altogether, the building, without this
or any adjuncts which may be after-thoughts, covers about 70,000 sq.ft., or nearly the average area of a mediæval cathedral of the first
class.316) possesses little architectural
beauty beyond what is due to its mass and the varied outline arising
from the mechanical contrivances necessary to resist the thrust of its
internal construction.It may be that, like the early Christian
basilicas at Rome, it was purposely left plain to distinguish it from
the external adornment of Heathen temples, or it may have been intended
to revêt it with marble, and add the external ornament afterwards.Before we became acquainted with the ornamental exteriors of Syrian
churches, the former theory would seem the more plausible, though it can
hardly now be sustained; and when we consider that the second dedication
only took place the year before Justinian’s death, and how soon
troublous times followed, we may fairly assume that what we now see is
only an incomplete design.Whatever may be the case with the exterior,
all the internal arrangements are complete, and perfect both from a
mechanical and an artistic point of view.In such a design as this, the
first requirement was to obtain four perfectly stable arches on which
the dome might rest.The great difficulty was with the two arches
running transversely north and south.These are as nearly as may be 100
ft.span and 120 high to the crown, and 10 ft.Each of them
has a mass of masonry behind it for an abutment, 75 ft.wide, only partially pierced by arches on the ground and gallery floor;
and as the mass might have been carried to any height, it ought, if
properly constructed, to have sufficed for an arch very much wider and
more heavily weighted than that which it supports.Yet the southern wall
is considerably bulged, and the whole of that side thrown out of the
perpendicular.This probably was the effect of the earthquake which
caused the fall of the dome in 559, since no further settlement seems to
have taken place.The
distance between the solid parts of the piers was 75 ft., and this was
filled up with a screen wall supporting the inner side of the arch; so,
unless that was crushed, the whole was perfectly stable.Pendentives
between these four arches ought not to have presented any difficulties.It would, however, have been better, from an architectural point of
view, if they had been carried further up and forward, so as to hang a
weight inside the dome to counteract the outward thrust, as was
afterwards so successfully practised at Beejapore.[227] As it is, the
dome rests rather on the outer edge of the system, without sufficient
space for abutment.In itself the dome is very little lower than a
hemisphere, being 107 ft.Externally, it
would have been better if higher; for internal effect this is
sufficient.Its base is pierced by forty small windows, so small and so
low as not to interfere in any way with the apparent construction, but
affording an ample supply of light—in that climate at least—to render
every part of the dome bright and cheerful.Sophia from E. to W. Scale 100 ft.Beyond the great dome, east and west, are two semi-domes of a diameter
equal to that of the great dome, and these are again cut into by two
smaller domes, so that the building, instead of being a Greek cross, as
usually asserted, is only 100 ft.across in the centre and 125 wide
beyond the central space each way.There is a little awkwardness in the
way in which the smaller semi-domes cut into the larger, and the three
windows of the latter are unconnected with any other part of the design,
which is unpleasing, but might easily be remedied in a second attempt.These very irregularities, however, give a variety and appropriateness
to the design which has probably never been surpassed.A single dome of
the area of the central and two semi-domes would not have appeared
nearly so large, and would have overpowered everything else in the
building.As it is, the eye wanders upwards from the large arcades of
the ground floor to the smaller arches of the galleries, and thence to
the smaller semi-domes.These lead the eye on to the larger, and the
whole culminates in the great central roof.Nothing, probably, so
artistic has been done on the same scale before or since.If, however, the proportions of this church are admirable, the details
are equally so.All the pillars are of porphyry, verd antique, or
marbles of the most precious kinds.The capitals are among the most
admirable specimens of the style.It will be remembered that the
governing line of a classical Corinthian capital is a hollow curve, to
which acanthus-leaves or other projecting ornaments were applied.When
the columns were close together, and had only a beam to support, this
form of capital was sufficient; but when employed to carry the
constructive arches of the fabric its weakness became instantly
apparent.Long before Justinian’s time, the tendency became apparent to
reverse the curve and to incise the ornament.Sophia the
transition is complete; the capitals are as full as elegance would
allow, and all the surfaces are flat, with ornaments relieved by
incision.In the lower tier of arches (Woodcut No.318) this is boldly
and beautifully done, the marble being left to tell its own story.In
the upper tier, further removed from the eye, the interstices are filled
in with black marble so as to ensure the desired effect.All the flat surfaces are covered with a mosaic of marble slabs of the
most varied patterns and beautiful colours; the domes, roofs, and curved
surfaces, with a gold-grounded mosaic relieved by figures or
architectural devices.Though much of the mosaic is now concealed,
enough is left to enable the effect of the whole to be judged of, and it
certainly is wonderfully grand and pleasing.The one thing wanting is
painted glass, like that which adorns the Dome of the Rock at Jerusalem,
to render this building as solemnly impressive as it is overpoweringly
beautiful.Sophia is so essentially different from the greater number of
churches, that it is extremely difficult to institute a comparison
between them.With regard to external effect, Gothic cathedrals
generally excel it; but whether by accident or by the inherent necessity
of the style is by no means so clear.In so far as the interior is
concerned, no Gothic architect ever rose to the conception of a hall 100
ft.high, and none ever disposed
each part more artistically to obtain the effect he desired to produce.Where the Byzantine style might profit from the experience subsequently
gained by Gothic architects is in the use of mouldings.The one defect
in the decoration of Sta.Sophia is that it depends too much on colour.It would have been better if the pier-arches, the window-frames, and the
string-courses generally had been more strongly accentuated by moulding
and panellings, but this is a slight defect among so many beauties.A comparison with the great Renaissance cathedrals is more easy, but
results even more favourably to the Byzantine example.Two of these have
domes which are considerably larger—St.Paul’s, London (108), is within a
foot of the same diameter, all the rest are smaller.[228] This, however,
is of less consequence than the fact that they are all adjuncts to the
design of the church.None of them are integral or supported by the rest
of the design, and all tend to dwarf the buildings they are attached to
rather than to heighten the general effect.With scarcely an exception
also all the Renaissance cathedrals employ internally great sprawling
pillars and pilasters, designed for external use by the Romans, which
not only diminish the apparent size of the building but produce an
effect of unreality and sham utterly fatal to true art.In fact, turn it as we will, and compare it as we may with any other
buildings of its class, the verdict seems inevitable that Sta.Sophia—internally at least, for we may omit the consideration of the
exterior, as unfinished—is the most perfect and most beautiful church
which has yet been erected by any Christian people.When its furniture
was complete the verdict would probably have been still more strongly in
its favour; but so few of the buildings described in these pages retain
these adjuncts in anything like completeness that they must be withdrawn
from both sides and our remarks be confined to the architecture, and
that only.Sophia at Thessalonica, according to Greek tradition,
was built by Justinian in the latter part of his reign.[229] It is a
church of considerable dimensions, measuring 140 ft.It possesses also an
upper gallery, and its arrangements generally are well considered and
artistic.There does not seem to be any documentary evidence of its age,
but judging from the details published in Texier, the date ascribed to
it seems probable.This has been further established lately from an
inscription found in the apse, which as well as the dome still retain
their ancient mosaics; the inscription is incomplete, but Messrs.Duchesne and Bayet, in an appendix to their work on Mount Athos, ascribe
it to the second half of the 6th century.The church possesses one
special characteristic: above the pendentives is a low drum, circular
internally,[230] in which windows are pierced, but which, externally, is
carried up square: by this means the angle piers are well weighted and
are thus enabled to resist more effectually the thrust of the arches
carrying the pendentives.The two side walls also, which in Sta.Sophia
at Constantinople were built almost flush with the inner arch, leaving
outside a widely-projecting arch thrown across between the buttresses to
carry the buttresses of the dome, are here placed flush with the outside
of the arch, thus giving increased space to the interior.The publication of the Count De Vogüé’s book has enabled us to realise
the civil and domestic architecture of Syria in the 5th and 6th
centuries with a completeness that, a very short time ago, would have
been thought impossible.Owing to the fact that every part of the
buildings in the Hauran was in stone, and that they were suddenly
deserted on the Mahomedan conquest, never, apparently, to be
re-occupied, many of the houses remain perfectly entire to the present
day, and in Northern Syria only the roofs are gone.Generally they seem to have been two storeys in height, adorned with
verandahs supported by stone columns, the upper having a solid
screen-fence of stone about 3 ft.high, intended apparently as
much to secure privacy to the sleeping apartments of the house as
protection against falling out.In some instances the lower storey is
twice the height of the upper, and contained the state apartments of the
house.In others, as in that at Refadi (Woodcut No.320), it seems to
have been intended for the offices.In the plan of a house at Moudjeleia
(Woodcut No.321) the principal block of the house is in two storeys,
with portico on ground floor and verandah over.The buildings at the
back with their courtyard were probably offices, and those in front by
the side of the main entrance warehouses or stores.In some instances one is startled to find details which we are
accustomed to associate with much more modern dates; as, for instance,
this window (Woodcut No.322) from the palace at Chaqqa, which there
seems no reason whatever for doubting belongs to the 3rd
century—anterior to the time of Constantine!It looks more like the
vagary of a French architect of the age of Francis I.Plan of house at Moudjeleia.]The building known as the Golden Gateway at Jerusalem and attributed to
Justinian, bears in its details many striking resemblances to those of
the 5th and 6th centuries in Central Syria, illustrated in De Vogüé’s
book.It is situated on the east side of the Haram enclosure, and
consists of a vestibule divided by columns into two aisles of three bays
each vaulted with a cupola[231] carried on arches, between which and the
capitals of the columns is found the Byzantine dosseret already referred
to.Within the eastern doorways (said to have been blocked up by Omar)
are two huge monoliths 14 ft.respectively, the
doorposts of an earlier gateway.Externally, on the entrance fronts
(east and west), the entablature of the pilasters is carried round the
circular-headed doorways which they flank; the earliest instance of this
development is found in the Palace of Diocletian at Spalato, and there
is a second example in the Roman gateway to the Mosque of Damascus,
which probably suggested the idea to the Byzantine builders; the sharp
stiff foliage of Greek type with which the ornament is carved on the
Golden Gate agrees in style and character with that in the church of St.Demetrius at Thessalonica dating from the commencement of the 6th
century.(From a Drawing by
Catherwood.Originally published in Fisher’s ‘Oriental Album.’)]

Of similar style and character are the arch-moulds of the double gate on
the south wall of the Haram, and the cupolas of the interior vestibule,
the columns carrying them however being probably of earlier date and
possibly part of the substructure of Herod’s temple.The surface
decoration of these cupolas is similar to that found in Central Syria.The sepulchral remains of Syria, both structural and rock-cut, seem
nearly as numerous as the dwellings of the living, and are full of
interest, not only from their frequently bearing dates, but from their
presenting new types of tombs, or old types in such new forms as
scarcely to be recognizable.Roof of one of the Compartments of the Gate Huldah.The oldest example, that of Hamrath in Souideh, dates from the 1st
century B.C., and consists of a tomb 28 ft.square decorated with
semi-detached Doric columns; the roof is gone, but it was probably
covered with one of pyramidal form like the tomb of Zechariah (Woodcut
No.The tomb of Diogenes at Hass (Woodcut No.326), also square, consisted
of two storeys, with a portico on the ground storey on one side, and a
peristyle on all four sides of the upper storey, above which rose the
central walls carrying a pyramidal roof, not stepped, as in the
Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, but with projecting bosses on each stone.The same class of roof is found on other tombs, being adopted probably
as the simplest method of covering over the tomb; these tombs date from
the 4th and 5th centuries, and in all cases the sepulchral chambers
within them are vaulted with large slabs of stone carried on stone ribs.Tomb at Hass]

Besides these, there is another class of tomb apparently very numerous,
in which the sepulchral chamber is below the ground, with vaulted
entrance rising to form a podium on which columns either two or four in
number are erected;[232] in the latter case the columns bearing an
entablature with small pyramidal roof; in the former a fragment of
architrave only, the two columns being sometimes tied together one-third
of the way down by a stone band with dentils carved on it: these tombs
are, many of them, dated, and belong to the 2nd and 3rd centuries.With our present limits it is only possible to characterize generally
the main features of the Byzantine style, and to indicate the sources
from which further information may be obtained.In the present instance
it is satisfactory to find that ample materials now exist for filling up
a framework which a few years ago was almost entirely a blank.Any one
who will master the works of De Vogüé, or Texier, or Salzenberg, and
other minor publications, may easily acquire a fair knowledge of the
older Byzantine style of architecture.Once it is grasped it will
probably be acknowledged that there are few more interesting chapters
than that which explains how a perfect Christian Church like that of
Sta.Sophia was elaborated out of the classical edifices of ancient
Rome.It will also probably be found that there are few more instructive
lessons to be learnt from the study of architectural history than the
tracing of the various contrivances which were so earnestly employed,
during the first two centuries of Christian supremacy, in attaining this
result.NEO-BYZANTINE STYLE.Irene, Constantinople—Churches at Ancyra, Trabala, and
  Constantinople—Churches at Thessalonica and in Greece—Domestic
  Architecture.Santa Sophia at Constantinople was not only the grandest and most
perfect creation of the old school of Byzantine art, but it was also the
last.It seems as if the creative power of the Empire had exhausted
itself in that great effort, and for long after it the history is a
blank.We always knew that the two centuries which elapsed between the
ages of Constantine and Justinian were ages of great architectural
activity.We knew that hundreds, it may be thousands, of churches were
erected during that period.With the two subsequent centuries, however,
the case seems widely different.Shortly after Justinian’s death, the
troubles of the Empire, the Persian wars of Heraclius, and, more than
either, the rise of the Mahomedan power in the East, and of the Roman
pontificate under Gregory the Great in the West—all tended so to disturb
and depress the Byzantine kingdom as to leave little leisure and less
means for the exercise of architectural magnificence.It is therefore
hardly probable that we shall ever be in a position to illustrate the
7th and 8th centuries as we now know we can the 5th and 6th.Still,
building must have gone on, because when we again meet the style, it is
changed.One of the very earliest churches of the new school is that of
Sta.Irene at Constantinople, rebuilt as we now find it by Leo the
Isaurian (A.D.It differs in several essential particulars
from the old style, and contains the germ of much that we find
frequently repeated.The change is not so great as might have taken
place in two centuries of building activity, but it is considerable.In
this church we find, apparently for the first time in a complete form,
the new mode of introducing the light to the dome through a
perpendicular drum, which afterwards became so universal that it serves
to fix the age of a building in the East with almost as much certainty
as the presence of a pointed arch does that of a building in the West.As this invention is so important, it may be well to recapitulate the
steps by which it was arrived at.Half Section, half Elevation, of Dome of Sta.The oldest mode of lighting a dome is practised in the Pantheon (Woodcut
No.191), by simply leaving out the central portion.Artistically and
mechanically nothing could be better, but before the invention of glass
it was intolerably inconvenient whenever much rain or snow fell.A
change therefore was necessary, and it is found in the tomb or temple of
Marcellus, built during the reign of Constantine on the Via Prenestina
at Rome.It consists simply of boring four circular holes through the
dome a little above its springing.The next step is seen at Thessalonica
in the church of St.There eight semi-circular
lunettes are pierced in the dome, at its springing, and answer the
purpose very perfectly.Sophia, where
forty windows introduce a flood of light without its ever falling on the
eyes of the spectator.After this it seems to have been considered
desirable not to break the hemisphere of the dome, but to place the
windows in a perpendicular circular rim of masonry—called the drum—and
to introduce the light always through that.Externally there can be no
doubt but that this was an improvement; it gave height and dignity to
the dome in small churches, where, without this elevation, the feature
would have been lost.Internally, however, the advantage is
problematical: the separation of the dome from its pendentives destroyed
the continuity of the roof, and introduced the stilted effect so
objectionable in Renaissance domes.In the Neo-Byzantine churches the
dome became practically a skylight on the roof, the drum increasing in
height and the dome diminishing in dignity as the style progressed.As
all the churches are small, the feature is unobjectionable; but in
larger edifices it would have been found difficult to construct it, and
the artistic result would hardly have been pleasing, even had this
difficulty been got over.Be this as it may, its value as a chronometric
landmark is undoubted.As a rule it may generally be asserted that, in all Christian domes
erected during the old Byzantine period, the light is introduced by
openings in the dome itself.[233] After that time, the light is as
generally admitted through windows in the drum, the dome itself being
cut into only in the rarest possible instances.If these views are correct, the church of St.Clement at Ancyra is a
transitional specimen subsequent to Sta.Sophia, because the dome is
raised timidly (Woodcut No.328) on a low drum pierced with four small
windows; but it is anterior to Sta.Irene, because the dome is still
pierced with twelve larger windows, after the manner of Sta.All the details of its architecture, in so far as
they can be made out, bear out this description.They are further
removed from the classical type than the churches of Justinian, and the
whole plan (Woodcut No.329) is more that which the Greek church
afterwards took than any of the early churches show.Its greatest
defect—though the one most generally inherent in the style—is in its
dimensions.long, over all externally, by 58 ft.Yet this is a fair average size of a Greek church of that age.Another church, very similar, is found at Myra, dedicated to St.Clement in size, and has a double
narthex considerably larger in proportion, but so ruined that it is
difficult to make out its plan, or to ascertain whether it is a part of
the original structure, or a subsequent addition.The cupola is raised
on a drum, and altogether the church has the appearance of being much
more modern than that at Ancyra.A third church of the same class, and better preserved, is found at
Trabala in Lycia.Clement, and similar in
its arrangements to Sta.Sophia, except in the omission of the
semi-domes, which seem never to have been adopted in the provinces,[234]
and indeed may be said to be peculiar to the metropolitan church.Notwithstanding the beauty of that feature, it appears to have remained
dormant till revived by the Turks in Constantinople, and there alone.In this example there are two detached octagonal buildings, either tombs
or sacristies; a form which, except in large detached buildings, does
not seem to have been so common as the circular, till after the time of
Justinian.Returning to the capital, we find one other remarkable peculiarity of
the Neo-Byzantine style in the attempt to allow the external surface of
an ordinary tunnel-vault to retain its form without any ridge whatever.It can hardly be doubted that this is artistically a mistake.With domes
it was early felt to be so, and consequently we always find a flower or
pinnacle in iron, or some such ornament, marking the centre.In this the
Saracenic architects were especially successful—all their domes possess
a central ornament sufficient to relieve them, and generally of the most
beautiful proportions.With the extrados of a circular vault, however,
it is even worse than with a dome.A roof is felt to be a contrivance to
keep off the rain.It may be more or less sloping, according to the
materials of which it is constructed; but to make one part of each ridge
sloping, and the central portion flat, is a discord that offends the
eye, besides looking weak and unmeaning.A pointed arch would avoid the
evil, but a reverse or ogee curve is perhaps the most pleasing.In the
Neo-Byzantine age, however, between the 8th and the 12th centuries, the
eye seems to have got accustomed to it.It is common in the East,
especially at Constantinople and at Venice.Mark’s and elsewhere
it became so familiar a form that it was copied and continued by the
Renaissance architects even to the end of the 16th century.One of the best illustrations of these peculiarities is the church of
Moné tés Choras at Constantinople, now converted into a mosque and
called Kahriyeh Djamisi.The older part of it seems to belong to the
11th century, the side-aisles to the 12th, and though small, it
illustrates the style perfectly.The porch consists of five arches
covered with an intersecting vault, visible both externally and
internally.The last two bays are covered with cupolas which still
retain their mosaics internally, and those of singular beauty and
brilliancy, though, owing to the constructive defects of the
intermediate parts, the wet has leaked through, and the mosaics have
mostly peeled off.Externally the front is ornamented with courses of
stones alternating with two or three layers of tiles, and even in its
ruined state is effective and picturesque.Its principal interest is
that it shows what was the matrix[235] of the contemporary church of St.Subsequent additions have much modified the external
appearance of St.Mark, but there can be very little doubt that
originally it was intended to be very like the façade shown in Woodcut
No.Not far from Moné tés Choras there are two other churches of the same
class and of about the same age.One, the Pantokrator, has been added to
at various times so as to cover a large space of ground, but it consists
consequently of small and ill-assorted parts.It retains, however, a
good deal of its marble pavements and other features of interest.The
other, known as the Fethîyeh Djamisi, is smaller and more complete, and
possesses some mosaics of considerable beauty.Elevation of Church of the Theotokos.(From Lenoir,
‘Architecture Monastique.’) Enlarged scale.]The best example of its class, however, in Constantinople is that known
as the Theotokos.Like those just mentioned it is very small, the church
itself being only 37 ft.by 45, and, though its double narthex and
lateral adjuncts add considerably to its dimensions, it is still only a
very small church.Some parts of it are as old as the 9th or 10th
century, but the façade represented in Woodcut No.333 is certainly not
older than the 12th century.Taking it altogether, it is perhaps the
most complete and elegant church of its class now known to exist in or
near the capital, and many of its details are of great beauty and
perfection.It seems scarcely possible to suppose that the meagre half-dozen of
small churches just enumerated are all that were erected in the capital
between the death of Justinian and the fall of the city.Yet there is no
evidence that the Turks destroyed any.They converted
them into mosques, finding them especially convenient for that purpose,
and they have maintained them with singularly little alteration to the
present day.This deficiency of examples in the capital is to some extent supplied by
those which are found existing at Thessalonica.Three churches belonging
to this age are illustrated in Texier and Pullan’s work.Apse of Church of the Apostles, Thessalonica.(From
Texier and Pullan.)]The first of these is the church of Kazandjita Djami, dedicated to the
Mother of God, a small church measuring only 53 ft.by 37, exclusive of
the apse.Its date is perfectly ascertained—viz., 1028.Next to these comes the church of Elias, A.D.1054, and very similar to
it in style is that of the Apostles (Woodcut No.334), which we may
consequently date with safety in the 11th century, from this
juxtaposition alone, though there are several other examples which
enable us to treat it as a characteristic type of the age.It is a
pleasing and picturesque specimen of Byzantine brickwork.Like all the
churches of the time, it is small, 63 ft.In plan it
very much resembles the Theotokos at Constantinople, but in elevation is
taller and thinner; though whether this arises from any local
peculiarity, or from some difference of age, is not clear.The earthquakes of the capital may have induced a less ambitious
form, as far as height is concerned, than was adopted in the provinces.There can be little doubt but that, if a systematic search were made
among the churches of Greece, many would be brought to light which would
be most useful in completing our knowledge of the Neo-Byzantine
style.[236] At Mount Athos there exists from twenty to thirty
monasteries, each with its Catholicon or principal church and other
chapels.Many of these are of ancient date, ranging between the 10th and
16th centuries, and although some of them may have been restored, in
some cases rebuilt in later times, they have not yet been examined or
illustrated by any competent architect.Brockhaus in his work[237] gives
the plan of three churches, one of which, the Catholicon (dated 1043) of
the Dochiariu Monastery (Woodcut No.335), is further illustrated by a
bird’s-eye view taken from a photograph.The domes and drums over the
narthex and two eastern chapels would seem to be later additions, made
either in consequence of the proximity of the buildings of the monastery
which obscured the light obtainable from windows, or to show better the
wall frescoes, which in the case of the narthex, where no windows ever
existed, must have been quite dark at first.The oldest church (963
A.D.)apparently is that of the Protaton at Caryas, which consists of a
short nave, a transept, and a long choir, and is wanting in that one
feature which is supposed to be characteristic of a Byzantine church,
viz., a dome; the whole building is covered like a basilica with a flat
wooden roof, beneath which are clerestory windows.Photogravures or
woodcuts are given of the churches of Chilandari (1197 A.D.), Xeropotamu
(1028-34 A.D.), the Laura (963 A.D., but rebuilt under Turkish rule),
and woodcuts from photographs in an interesting description of the
Monasteries by Mr.A. Riley,[238] give a good general idea of the work
to be found in Athos, from which it would seem that the chief interest
centres in the sumptuous carvings of the icon and stalls,[239] and in
the frescoes with which most of the interiors of the churches are
painted.For Greece proper we are dependent almost wholly on Couchaud[240] and
Blouet.[241] So far as the illustrations go they suggest that there are
no churches of such dimensions as would ensure dignity, nor are any so
beautiful in outline or detail as to make us regret much that we do not
know more about them.Still they are sufficiently original to be worthy
of study, and when properly known may help to join together some of the
scattered links of the chain which once connected the architecture of
the West and East, but which is at present so difficult to follow out.In Athens there are several churches of considerable interest, and not
without architectural pretension.The
largest is that known as Panagia Lycodemo, or the church of St.Nicodemus, and is only 62 ft.It seems
also to be the oldest, since its dome is partially pierced with windows
inside, though outside there is a distinctly marked drum (Woodcut No.Notwithstanding the smallness of its dimensions, considerable
effect is obtained internally by the judicious arrangement of the parts
and the harmony of proportion which reigns throughout.The exterior is
also pleasing, though the loss of the cornice gives an unfinished look
to the whole, and there is a want of sufficient connection between the
dome and the walls of the building to make them part of one composition.A more beautiful and more interesting example is the church known as the
Catholicon or Cathedral at Athens (Woodcut No.It is a cathedral,
however, only in a Greek sense, certainly not as understood in the Latin
Church, for its dimensions are only 40 ft.It
is almost impossible to judge of its age from its details, since they
are partly borrowed from older classical buildings, or imitations of
classical forms, so fashioned as to harmonize with parts which are old.But the tallness of its dome, the form of its windows, and the internal
arrangements, all point to a very modern date for its erection—as
probably the 13th century as the 11th or 12th.The church of the Virgin at Mistra in the Peloponnesus was built in the
13th century on a hillside overlooking the plain of Sparta, and partly
with materials taken from the remains of the ancient city; but though it
belongs possibly to the same age as the Catholicon at Athens, it differs
considerably from it in style, and bears much more resemblance to the
churches of Apulia and Sicily than either of those described above.(From Couchaud, ‘Églises
Byzantines en Grèce.’) Enlarged scale.]Where arcades are used externally in these Greek churches, they are
generally supported by pillars of somewhat classical look (often old
classic columns and capitals were used up), crowned by capitals of the
square foliaged form, employed to support arches in the early styles all
over Europe; and the windows, when divided, take merely the form of
diminutive arcades.The Byzantines never attained to tracery; all their
early windows are single round-headed openings.These were afterwards
grouped together in threes and fives; and, as in the Gothic style, when
they could be put under one discharging arch, the piers were attenuated
till they became almost mullions, but always supporting constructive
arches, without any tendency to run into interlacing forms like the
Gothic.The universal employment of mural painting in Byzantine
churches, and the consequent exclusion of painted glass, rendered the
use of the large windows which the Gothic architects employed quite
inadmissible; and in such a climate very much smaller openings sufficed
to admit all the light that was required.Tracery would thus, in fact,
have been an absurdity, and the windows were often filled in with
transparent marble slabs pierced with holes, which were either glazed or
occasionally even left open.The Byzantine architects sought to ornament
their windows externally by the employment of tiles or colours disposed
in various patterns, and often produced a very pleasing effect, as may
be seen from the woodcut (No.337) illustrating the apse of the Panagia
Lycodemo at Athens, in the Hebdomon Palace (Woodcut No.342), and other
specimens already quoted.Occasionally we find in these churches projecting porches or balconies,
and machicolations, which give great relief to the general flatness of
the walls.These features are all marked with that elegance peculiar to
the East, and more especially to a people claiming descent from the
ancient Greeks, and possibly having some of their blood in their veins.Sometimes, too, even a subordinate apse is supported on a bracket-like
balcony, so as to form a very pleasing object, as in the accompanying
specimen from Mistra.On the whole the Neo-Byzantine style may be said to be characterised by
considerable elegance, with occasional combinations of a superior order;
but after the time of Justinian the country was too deficient in unity
or science to attempt anything great or good, and too poor to aspire to
grandeur, so that it has no claim to rank among the great styles of the
earth.[242] The old Byzantine style was elevated to a first-class
position through the buildings of Justinian; but from his time the
history of the art is a history of decline, like that of the Eastern
Empire itself and of Greece, down to the final extinction both of the
Empire and the style, under the successive conquests by the Venetians
and the Turks.The only special claim which the Neo-Byzantine style
makes upon our sympathies or attention is that of being the direct
descendant of Greek and Roman art.As such, it forms a connecting link
between the past and present which must not be overlooked, while in
itself it has sufficient merit to reward the student who shall apply
himself to its elucidation.Palace of the Hebdomon, Constantinople.]It is more than probable that very considerable remains of the civil or
domestic architecture of the Neo-Byzantine period may still be
recovered.Most of their palaces or public buildings have continued to
be occupied by their successors, but the habits of Turkish life are
singularly opposed to the prying of the archæologist.Almost the only
building which has been brought to light and illustrated is the palace
of the Hebdomon at Blachernæ in Constantinople, built by Constantine
Porphyrogenitus (913-949).All that remains of it, however, is a block
of buildings 80 ft.by 40 in plan, forming one end of a courtyard; those
at the other end, which were more extensive, being too much ruined to be
restored.The parts that remain probably belong to the 9th century, and
consist of two halls, one over the other, the lower supported by pillars
carrying vaults, the upper free.The façade towards the court (Woodcut
342) is of considerable elegance, being adorned by a mosaic of bricks of
various colours disposed in graceful patterns, and forming an
architectural decoration which, if not of the highest class, is very
appropriate for domestic architecture.One great cause of the deficiency of examples may be the combustibility
of the capital.They may have been destroyed in the various fires, and
outside Constantinople the number of large cities and their wealth and
importance was gradually decreasing till the capital itself sunk into
the power of the Turks in the year 1453.CHAPTER V.

The architectural province of Armenia forms an almost exact pendant to
that of Greece in the history of Byzantine architecture.Both were early
converted to Christianity, and Greece remained Christian without any
interruption from that time to this.Yet all her earlier churches have
perished, we hardly know why, and left us nothing but an essentially
Mediæval style.Nearly the same thing happened in Armenia, but there the
loss is only too easily accounted for.The Persian persecution in the
5th and 6th centuries must have been severe and lasting, and the great
_bouleversement_ of the Mahomedan irruption in the 7th century would
easily account for the disappearance of all the earlier monuments.When,
in more tranquil times—in the 8th and 9th centuries—the Christians were
permitted to rebuild their churches, we find them all of the same small
type as those of Greece, with tall domes, painted with frescoes
internally, and depending for external effect far more on minute
elaboration of details than on any grandeur of design or proportion.Although the troubles and persecutions from the 5th to the 8th century
may have caused the destruction of the greater part of the monuments, it
by no means follows that all have perished.On the contrary, we know of
the church above alluded to (p.428) as still existing at Nisibin and
belonging to the 4th century, and there can be little doubt that many
others exist in various corners of the land; but they have hardly yet
been looked for, at least not by anyone competent to discriminate
between what was really old and what may have belonged to some
subsequent rebuilding or repair.Till this more careful examination of the province shall have been
accomplished, our history of the style cannot be carried back beyond the
Hejira.Even then very great difficulty exists in arranging the
materials, and in assigning correct dates to the various examples.In
the works of Texier,[243] Dubois,[244] Brosset,[245] and Grimm[246] some
forty or fifty churches are described and figured in more or less
detail, but in most cases the dates assigned to them are derived from
written testimony only, the authors not having sufficient knowledge of
the style to be able to check the very fallacious evidence of the
_litera scripta_.In consequence of this, the dates usually given are
those of the building of the first church on the spot, whereas, in a
country so troubled by persecution as Armenia, the original church may
have been rebuilt several times, and what we now see is often very
modern indeed.Among the churches now existing in Armenia, the oldest seems to be that
in the village of Dighour near Ani.There are neither traditions nor
inscriptions to assist in fixing its date; but, from the simplicity of
its form and its quasi-classical details, it is evidently older than any
other known examples, and with the aid of the information conveyed in De
Vogüé’s recent publications we can have little hesitation in assigning
it to the 7th century.[247] The church is not large, being only 95 ft.Internally its design is characterised by
extreme solidity and simplicity, and all the details are singularly
classical in outline.The dome is an ellipse, timidly constructed, with
far more than the requisite amount of abutment.One of its most marked
peculiarities is the existence of two external niches placed in
projecting wings and which were no doubt intended to receive altars.Its
flanks are ornamented by three-quarter columns of debased classical
design.These support an architrave which is bent over the heads of the
windows as in the churches of Northern Syria erected during the 6th
century.Its western and lateral doorways are ornamented by horse-shoe arches,
which are worth remarking here, as it is a feature which the Saracenic
architects used so currently and employed for almost every class of
opening.The oldest example of this form known is in the doorway of the
building called Takt-i-Gero on Mount Zagros.[248] In this little shrine,
all the other details are so purely and essentially classic that the
building must be dated before or about the time of Constantine.The
horse-shoe arch again occurs in the church at Dana on the Euphrates in
540.[249] At Dighour we find it used, not in construction but as an
ornamental feature.The stilting of the arch was evidently one of those
experiments which the architects of that time were making in order to
free themselves from the trammels of the Roman semi-circular arch.The
Saracens carried it much further and used it with marked success, but
this is probably the last occasion in which it was employed by a
Christian architect as a decorative expedient.The six buttresses, with their offsets, which adorn the façade, are
another curious feature in the archæology of this church.If they are
integral parts of the original design, which there seems no reason to
doubt, they anticipate by several centuries the appearance of this form
in Western Europe.West Elevation of Church at Usunlar.One of the oldest and least altered of the Armenian churches seems to be
that of Usunlar, said to have been erected by the Catholicos Jean IV.In plan it looks like a peristylar
temple, but the verandahs which surround it are only low arcades, and
have very little affinity with classical forms.These are carried round
the front, but there pierced only by the doorway.The elevation, as here
exhibited, is simple, but sufficiently expresses the internal
arrangements, and, with an octagonal dome, forms, when seen in
perspective, a pleasing object from every point of view.Both plan and
design are, however, exceptional in the province.A far more usual
arrangement is that found at Pitzounda in Abkassia, which may be
considered as the typical form of an Armenian church.It is said to have
been erected by the Emperor Justinian, and there is nothing in the style
or ornamentation of the lower part that seems to gainsay its being his.But the plan is so like many that belong to a much later age, that we
must hesitate before we can feel sure that it has not been rebuilt at
some more modern date.Its cupola certainly belongs to a period long
after the erection of Sta.327),
when the dome pierced with tall windows had become the fashionable form
of dome in the Byzantine school.Its interior, also, is unusually tall,
and the pointed arches under the dome look like integral parts of the
design, and when so employed belong certainly to a much more modern
date.On the whole, therefore, it seems that this church, as we now see
it, may have been rebuilt in the 9th or 10th century.Whatever its date, it is a pleasing example of the style.Externally it
is devoid of ornament except what is obtained by the insertion of tiles
between the courses of the stone, and a similar relief to the windows;
but even this little introduction of colour gives it a gay and cheerful
appearance, more than could easily be obtained by mouldings or carving
in stone.The upper galleries of the nave and the chapels of the choir are also
well expressed in the external design, and altogether, for a small
church—which it is (only 137 ft.by 75)—it is as pleasing a composition
as could easily be found.The idea that the date of this church is considerably more modern than
Dubois and others are inclined to assign to it, is confirmed by a
comparison of its plan with that at Bedochwinta, which Brosset
determines from inscriptions to belong to the date 1556-1575; and the
knowledge lately acquired tends strongly to the conviction that this
plan of church belongs to a later period in the Middle Ages, though it
is difficult to determine when it was introduced, and it may be only a
continuation of a much earlier form.One other church of this part of the world seems to claim especial
mention, that of Mokwi, built in the 10th century, and painted as we
learn from inscriptions, between 1080 and 1125.It is a large and
handsome church, but its principal interest lies in the fact that in
dimensions and arrangement it is almost identical with the
contemporaneous church of Sta.Sophia at Novogorod, showing a connection
between the two countries which will be more particularly pointed out
hereafter.It is now very much ruined, and covered with a veil of
creepers which prevents its outward form from being easily
distinguished.[250]]

As will be perceived, its plan is only an extension of the two last
mentioned, having five aisles instead of three; but it is smaller in
scale and more timid in execution.The church which it most resembles is
that at Trabala in Syria (Woodcut No.330), which is certainly of an
earlier date than any we are acquainted with further east.Practically
the same plan occurs at Athens (Woodcut No.338), and at Mistra (Woodcut
No.339), but these seem on a smaller scale than at Mokwi, so that it
may be considered as the typical form of a Neo-Byzantine church for four
or five centuries, and it would consequently be unsafe to attempt to fix
a date from its peculiarities.Plan of Church at Etchmiasdin.Interesting as these may be in an historical point of view, the most
important ecclesiastical establishment in this part of the world is that
of Etchmiasdin.Here are four churches built on the spots from which,
according to tradition, rose the two arches or rainbows, crossing one
another at right angles, on which our Saviour is said to have sat when
he appeared to St.They consequently ought to be at the four
angles of a square, or rectangle of some sort, but this is far from
being the case.The principal of these churches is that whose plan is
represented in Woodcut No.It stands in the centre of a large
square, surrounded by ecclesiastical buildings, and is on the whole
rather an imposing edifice.Its porch is modern; so also, comparatively
speaking, is its dome; but the plan, if not the greater part of the
substructure, is ancient, and exhibits the plainness and simplicity
characteristic of its age.The other three churches lay claim to as
remote a date of foundation as this, but all have been so altered in
modern times that they have now no title to antiquity.The idea that the churches at Pitzounda and Bedochwinta must be
comparatively modern is confirmed by comparing their plan with that of
Kouthais, a church which there seems no reasonable ground for doubting
was founded in 1007, and erected, pretty much as we now find it, in the
early part of the 11th century.It has neither coupled piers nor pointed
arches, but is adorned externally with reed-like pilasters and elaborate
frets, such as were certainly employed at Ani in the course of the 11th
century.355) of one of its windows
exhibits the Armenian style of decoration of this age, but is such as
certainly was not employed before this time, though with various
modifications it became typical of the style at its period of greatest
development.Even Etchmiasdin, however, sinks into insignificance, in an
architectural point of view, when compared with Ani, which was the
capital of Armenia during its period of greatest unity and elevation,
and was adorned by the Bagratide dynasty with a series of buildings
which still strike the traveller with admiration, at least for the
beauty of their details; for, like all churches in this part of the
world, they are very small.If, however, the cathedral at Ani is
interesting to the architect from its style, it is still more so to the
archæologist from its date, since there seems no reason to doubt that it
was built in the year 1010, as recorded in an inscription on its walls.This, perhaps, might be put on one side as a mistake, if it were not
that there are two beautiful inscriptions on the façade, one of which is
dated 1049, the other 1059.To this we must add our knowledge that the
city was sacked by Alp Arslan in 1064, and that the dynasty which alone
could erect such a monument was extinguished in 1080.With all this
evidence, it is startling to find a church not only with pointed arches
but with coupled piers and all the characteristics of a complete
pointed-arch style, such as might be found in Italy or Sicily not
earlier than the 13th century.This peculiarity is, however, confined to
the constructive parts of the interior.The plan is that of Pitzounda or
Bedochwinta, modified only by the superior constructive arrangement
which the pointed arch enabled the architects to introduce; and
externally the only pointed arch anywhere to be detected, is in the
transept, where the arch of the vault is simulated to pass through to
the exterior.In the plan and elevation of the building will be observed a peculiarity
which was afterwards almost universal in the style.It is the angular
recess which marks the form of the apses outside without breaking the
main lines of the building.In the lateral elevation of this cathedral
(Woodcut No.358) they are introduced on each side of the portal where
the construction did not require them, in order to match those at the
east end.But in the Cathedral at Samthawis (Woodcut No.359) they are
seen in their proper places on each side of the central apse.Though
this church was erected between the years 1050-1079, we find these
niches adorned with a foliation (Woodcut No.360) very like what we are
accustomed to consider the invention of the 14th century in Europe,
though even more elegant than anything of its class used by the Gothic
architects.At Sandjerli, not far from Ani, is another church, which from
inscriptions translated by M. Brosset, and from sections given by him,
appears to belong to the same date (1033-1044), and to possess coupled
columns and pointed arches like those of the cathedral of Ani, which
indeed it resembles in many points, and which renders the date above
given highly probable.East Elevation of Chapel at Samthawis.The plans above quoted may probably be taken as those most typical of
the style, but in no part of the world are the arrangements of churches
so various.All being small, there were no constructive difficulties to
be encountered, and as no congregation was to be accommodated, the
architects apparently considered themselves at liberty to follow their
fancies in any manner that occurred to them.The consequence is that the
plans of Armenian churches defy classification; some are square, or
rectangles of every conceivable proportion of length to breadth, some
octagons or hexagons, and some of the most indescribable irregularity.Frequently two, three, or four are grouped and joined together.In some
instances the sacred number of seven are coupled together in one design,
though more generally each little church is an independent erection; but
they are all so small that their plans are of comparatively little
importance.No grandeur of effect or poetry of perspective can be
obtained without considerable dimensions, and these are not to be found
in Armenia.(From Layard’s ‘Nineveh and
Babylon.’)]

There are also some examples of circular churches, but these are far
from being numerous.Generally speaking they are tombs, or connected
with sepulchral rites, and are indeed mere amplifications of the usual
tombs of the natives of the country, which are generally little models
of the domes of Armenian churches placed on the ground, though perhaps
it would be more correct to say that the domes were copied from the
tombs than the reverse.The most elegant of all those hitherto made known is one found at Ani,
illustrated in Woodcuts Nos.Notwithstanding the smallness of
its dimensions, it is one of the most elegant sepulchral chapels known.Another on a larger scale (Woodcut No.This tomb shows all the peculiarities of the Armenian
style of the 11th or 12th century.Though so much larger, it is by no
means so beautiful as the last mentioned tomb at Ani.In its
ornamentation a further refinement is introduced, inasmuch as the
reed-like columns are tied together by true love-knots instead of
capitals—a freak not uncommon either in Europe at the same age, or in
the East at the present day, but by no means to be recommended as an
architectural expedient.With scarcely an exception, all the buildings in the Armenian provinces
are so small that they would hardly deserve a place in a history of
architecture were it not for the ingenuity of their plans and the
elegance of their details.The beauty of the latter is so remarkable
that, in order to convey a correct notion of the style, it would be
necessary to illustrate them to an extent incompatible with the scope of
this work.In them too will be found much that has hitherto been
ascribed to other sources.364), for
instance, would generally be put down as Saracenic of the best age, but
it belongs, with a great deal more quite as elegant, to one of the
churches at Ani; and the capital from Gelathi (Woodcut No.365) would
not excite attention if found in Ireland.The interlacing scrolls which
occupy its head are one of the most usual as well as one of the most
elegant modes of decoration employed in the province, and are applied
with a variety and complexity nowhere else found in stone, though they
may be equalled in some works illustrated by the pen.Besides, however, its beauty in an artistic point of view, this basket
pattern, as it is sometimes called, is still more so as an Ethnographic
indication which, when properly investigated, may lead to the most
important conclusions.366, 367, and
368, taken from churches at a now deserted village called Ish Khan, will
serve to explain its more usual forms; but it occurs almost everywhere
in the Armenian architectural province, and with as infinite a variety
of details as are to be found with its employment in Irish manuscripts.Window in small Church at Ish Khan, Tortoom.Jamb of doorway at Ish Khan Church, Armenia.Out of Armenia it occurs in the church at Kurtea el Argyisch in
Wallachia (Woodcut No.385), and is found in Hungary and Styria, and no
antiquary will probably fail to recognise it as the most usual and
beautiful pattern on Irish crosses and Scotch sculptured stones.On the
other hand it occurs frequently in the monolithic deepdans or lamp-posts
and in the temples on the Canarese or West Coast of India, and in all
these instances with so little change of form that it is almost
impossible that these examples should be independent inventions.Still
the gaps in the sequence are so great that it is very difficult to see
how they could emanate from one centre.Few, however, who know anything
of the early architecture of Ireland can fancy that it did come from
Rome across Great Britain, but that it must have had its origin further
east, among some people using groups of churches and small cells,
instead of congregational basilicas.So far, too, as we can yet see, it
is to the East we must look for the original design of the mysterious
round towers which form so characteristic a feature of Irish
architecture, and were afterwards so conspicuous as minars in the East,
and nowhere more so than in Armenia.Recent researches, too, are making
it more and more clear that Nestorian churches did exist all down the
West Coast of India from a very early period, so that it would not be
impossible that from Persia and Armenia they introduced the favourite
style of ornament.All this may seem idle speculation, and it may turn out that the
similarities are accidental, but at present it certainly does not look
as if they were, and if they do emanate from a common centre, tracing
them back to their original may lead to such curious ethnological and
historical conclusions that it is at all events worth while pointing
them out in order that others may pursue the investigation to its
legitimate conclusion.Taken altogether, Armenian architecture is far more remarkable for
elegance than for grandeur, and possesses none of that greatness of
conception or beauty of outline essential to an important architectural
style.It is still worthy of more attention than it has hitherto
received, even for its own sake.Its great title to interest will always
be its ethnological value, being the direct descendant of the Sassanian
style, and the immediate parent of that of Russia.At the same time,
standing on the eastern confines of the Byzantine Empire, it received
thence that impress of Christian art which distinguished it from the
former, and which it transmitted to the latter.It thus forms one of
those important links in the chain of architectural history which when
lost render the study of the subject so dark and perplexed, but when
appreciated add so immensely to its philosophical interest.ROCK-CUT CHURCHES.Churches at Tchekerman, Inkerman, and Sebastopol—Excavations at Kieghart
  and Vardzie.Intermediate between the Armenian province which has just been described
and the Russian, which comes next in the series, lies a territory of
more than usual interest to the archæologist, though hardly demanding
more than a passing notice in a work devoted to architecture.In the
neighbourhood of Kertch, which was originally colonised by a people of
Grecian or Pelasgic origin, are found numerous tumuli and sepulchres
belonging generally to the best age of Greek art, but which, barring
some slight local peculiarities, would hardly seem out of place in the
cemeteries of Etruria or Crete.At a later age it was from the shores of the Palus Mœotis and the
Caucasus that tradition makes Woden migrate to Scandinavia, bearing with
him that form of Buddhism[251] which down to the 11th century remained
the religion of the North—while, as if to mark the presence of some
strange people in the land, we find everywhere rock-cut excavations of a
character, to say the least of it, very unusual in the West.These have not yet been examined with the care necessary to enable us to
speak very positively regarding them;[252] but, from what we do know, it
seems that they were not in any instance tombs, like those in Italy and
many of those in Africa or Syria.Nor can we positively assert that any
of them were viharas or monasteries[253] like most of those in India.Generally they seem to have been ordinary dwellings, but in some
instances appropriated by the Christians and formed into churches.(From Dubois de Montpereux.)]One, apparently, of the oldest is a rectangular excavation at Tchekerman
in the Crimea.in length by 21 in width, with hardly any
decoration on its walls, but having in the centre a choir with four
pillars on each face, which there seems no doubt was originally devoted
to Christian purposes.The cross on the low screen that separates it
from the nave is too deeply cut and too evidently integral to have been
added.But for this it would seem to have been intended for a Buddhist
vihara.(From Dubois de
Montpereux.)]Under the fortress at Inkerman—facing the position held by our
army—there is an excavation undoubtedly of Christian origin.It is a
small church with side-aisles, apse, and all the necessary
accompaniments.Beyond this is a square excavation apparently intended
as a refectory, and other apartments devoted to the use of a monastic
establishment.These again are so like what we find among the Buddhist
excavations in India as to be quite startling.The one point in which
this church differs from a Buddhist chaitya is that the aisle does not
run round behind the altar.This is universally the case in Buddhist,
but only exceptionally so in Christian, churches.Close to Sebastopol is another small church cave with its accompanying
monastery.This one is said to be comparatively modern, and if its
paintings are parts of the original design it may be so, but no certain
data are given for fixing the age of the last two examples.That under
the fortress (Woodcut No.371) seems, however, to be of considerable
antiquity.There is one which in plan is very like those just described at Vardzie,
said to belong to the 12th century, and another, almost absolutely
identical with a Buddhist vihara, at Kieghart in Armenia, which has a
date upon it, A.D.On the banks of the Kour, however, at Ouplous-Tsikhe and Vardzie, are
some excavations which are either temples or monasteries, and which
range from the Christian era downwards.These are generally assumed to
be residences—one is called the palace of Queen Thamar—and they were
evidently intended for some stately purpose.Yet they were not temples
in any sense in which that term would be employed by the Greek or Roman
world.Whatever their destination, these rock-cut examples make, when
taken altogether, as curious a group of monuments as are to be found in
this corner of Asia, and which may lead afterwards to curious
archæological inferences.At present we are hardly in a position to
speculate on the subject, and merely point to it here as one well
meriting further investigation.MEDIÆVAL ARCHITECTURE OF RUSSIA.Churches at Kief—Novogorod—Moscow—Towers.Rurik the Varangian at Novogorod   A.D.850

The long series of the architectural styles of the Christian world which
has been described in the preceding pages terminates most appropriately
with the description of the art of a people who had less knowledge of
architecture and less appreciation of its beauties than any other with
which we are acquainted.During the Middle Ages the Russians did not
erect one single building which is worthy of admiration, either from its
dimensions, its design, or the elegance of its details; nor did they
invent one single architectural feature which can be called their own.It is true the Tartars brought with them their bulbous form of dome, and
the Russians adopted it, and adhere to it to the present day,
unconscious that it is the symbol of their subjection to a race they
affect to despise; but excepting as regards this one feature, their
architecture is only a bad and debased copy of the style of the
Byzantine Empire.There is nothing, in fact, in the architecture of the
country to lead us to doubt that the mass of the population of Russia
was always of purely Aryan stock, speaking a language more nearly allied
to the Sanskrit than any of the other Mediæval tongues of Europe, and
that whatever amount of Tartar blood may have been imported, it was not
sufficient to cure the inartistic tendencies of the race.So much is
this felt to be the case, that the Russians themselves hardly lay claim
to the design of a single building in their country from the earliest
times to the present day.They admit that all the churches at Kief,
their earliest capital, were erected by Greek architects; those of
Moscow by Italians or Germans; while those of St.Petersburg, we know,
were, with hardly a single exception, erected by Italian, German, or
French architects.These last have perpetrated caricatures of revived
Roman architecture worse than are to be found anywhere else.Bad as are
some of the imitations of Roman art found in western Europe, they are
all the work of native artists; are, partially at least, adapted to the
climate, and common-sense peeps through their worst absurdities; but in
Russia only second-class foreigners have been employed, and the result
is a style that out-herods Herod in absurdity and bad taste.Architecture has languished not only in Russia, but wherever the
Sclavonic race predominates.In Poland, Hungary, Moldavia, Wallachia,
&c., although some of these countries have at times been rich and
prosperous, there is not a single original structure worthy to be placed
in comparison with even the second-class contemporary buildings of the
Celtic or Teutonic races.Besides the ethnographic inaptitude of the nation, however, there are
other causes which would lead us to anticipate, _à priori_, that nothing
either great or beautiful was likely to exist in the Mediæval
architecture of Russia.In the first place, from the conversion of Olga
(964) to the accession of Peter the Great (1689), with whom the national
style expired, the country hardly emerged from barbarism.Torn by
internal troubles, or devastated by incursions of the Tartars, the
Russians never enjoyed the repose necessary for the development of art,
and the country was too thinly peopled to admit of that concentration of
men necessary for the carrying out of any great architectural
undertaking.Another cause of bad architecture is found in the material used, which
is almost universally brick covered with plaster; and it is well known
that the tendency of plaster architecture is constantly to extravagance
in detail and bad taste in every form.It is also extremely
perishable,—a fact which opens the way to repairs and alterations in
defiance of congruity and taste, and to the utter annihilation of
everything like archæological value in the building.When the material was not brick it was wood, like most of the houses in
Russia of the present day; and the destroying hand of time, aided no
doubt by fire and the Tartar invasions, have swept away many buildings
which would serve to fill up gaps, now, it is feared, irremediable in
the history of the art.Notwithstanding all this, the history of architecture in Russia need not
be considered as entirely a blank, or as wholly devoid of interest.Locally we can follow the history of the style from the south to the
north.Springing originally from two roots—one at Constantinople, the
other in Armenia—it gradually extended itself northward.It first
established itself at Cherson, then at Kief, and after these at Vladimir
and Moscow, whence it spread to the great commercial city of Novogorod.At all these places it maintained itself till supplanted by the rise of
St.Though the Princess Olga was baptised in 955, the general profession of
Christianity in Russia did not take place till the reign of Vladimir
(981-1015).He built the wooden cathedral at Cherson, which has
perished.At Kief the same monarch built the church of Dessiatinnaya,
the remains of which existed till within the last few years, when they
were removed to give place to a modern reproduction.Basil in the same city, which, notwithstanding modern
improvements, still retains its ancient plan, and is nearly identical in
arrangement and form with the Catholicon at Athens (Woodcut No.372) gives a fair idea of the usual dimensions of
the older churches of Russia.The parts shaded lighter are subsequent
additions.A greater builder than Vladimir was Prince Yaroslaf (1019-1054).Irene at Kief (Woodcut No.373), the ruins of
which still exist.It is a good specimen of the smaller class of
churches of that date.His great works were the cathedrals of Kief and Novogorod, both
dedicated to Sta.Sophia, and with the church at Mokwi quoted above
(Woodcut No.352) forming the most interesting group of Russian churches
of that age.All three belong to the 11th century, and are so extremely
similar in plan, that, deducting the subsequent additions from the two
Russian examples, they may almost be said to be identical.They also
show so intimate a connection between the places on the great commercial
road from the Caucasus to the Baltic, that they point out at once the
line along which we must look for the origin of the style.Of the three, that at Kief[254] (Woodcut No.374) is the largest; but it
is nearly certain that the two outer aisles are subsequent additions,
and that the original church was confined to the remaining seven aisles.As it now stands its dimensions are 185 ft.from north to south, and 136
from east to west.It consequently covers only about 25,000 ft., or not
half the usual dimensions of a Western cathedral of the same class.As
will be perceived, its plan is like that of the churches of Asia Minor,
so far as the central aisles are concerned.In lateral extension it
resembles a mosque, a form elsewhere very unusual in Christian churches,
but which here may be a Tartar peculiarity.At all events it is
generally found in Russian churches, which never adopt the long
basilican form of the West.If their length in an eastern and western
direction ever exceeds the breadth, it is only by taking in the narthex
with the body of the church.East End of the Church at Novogorod.Internally this church retains many of its original arrangements, and
many decorations which, if not original, are at least restorations or
copies of those which previously occupied their places.Externally it
has been so repaired and rebuilt that it is difficult to detect what
belongs to the original work.In this respect the church of Novogorod has been more fortunate.Owing
to the early decline of the town it has not been much modernised.The
interior retains many of its primitive features.Among other furniture
is a pair of bronze doors of Italian workmanship of the 12th century
closely resembling those of San Zenone at Verona.The part of the
exterior that retains most of its early features is the eastern end,
represented in the Woodcut No.It retains the long reed-like shafts
which the Armenians borrowed from the Sassanians, and which penetrated
even to this remote corner.Whether the two lower circular apses shown
in the view are old is by no means clear: but it is probable that they
are at least built on ancient foundations.The domes on the roof, and
indeed all the upper part of the building, belong to a more modern date
than the substructure.The cathedral of Tchernigow, near Kief, founded 1024, retains perhaps
more of its original appearance externally than any other church of its
age.Like almost all Russian churches it is square in plan, with a dome
in the centre surrounded by four smaller cupolas placed diagonally at
the corners.To the eastward are three apses, and the narthex is flanked
by two round towers, the upper parts of which, with the roofs, have been
modernised, but the whole of the walls remain as originally erected,
especially the end of the transept, which precisely resembles what we
find in Greek Churches of the period.(From Blasius, ‘Reise in
Russland.’)]

To the same age belong the convent of the Volkof (1100) and of Yourief
at Novogorod, the church of the Ascension, and several others at Kief.All these are so modernised as, except in their plans, to show but
slight traces of their origin.Another of the great buildings of the age was the cathedral of Vladimir
(1046).It is said to have been built, like the rest, by Greek artists.The richness and beauty of this building have been celebrated by early
travellers, but it has been entirely passed over by more modern writers.From this it is perhaps to be inferred that its ancient form is
completely disguised in modern alterations.The ascendency of Kief was of short duration.Early in the 13th century
the city suffered greatly from civil wars, fires, and devastations of
every description, which humbled her pride, and inflicted ruin upon her
from which she never wholly recovered.Vladimir was after this the residence of the grand dukes, and in the
beginning of the 14th century Moscow became the capital, which it
continued to be till the seat of empire was transferred by Peter the
Great to St.During these three centuries Moscow was no
doubt adorned with many important buildings, since almost every church
traces its foundation back to the 14th century; but as fires and Tartar
invasions have frequently swept over the city since then, few retain any
of the features of their original foundation, and it may therefore
perhaps be well to see what can be gleaned in the provinces before
describing the buildings of the capital.As far as can be gathered from the sketch-books of travellers or their
somewhat meagre notes, there are few towns of Russia of any importance
during the Middle Ages which do not possess churches said to have been
founded in the first centuries after its conversion to Christianity;
though whether the existing buildings are the originals, or how far they
may have been altered and modernised, will not be known till some
archæologist visits the country, directing his attention to this
particular inquiry.Although the Russians probably built as great a
number of churches as any nation of Christendom, yet like the Greek
churches they were all undoubtedly small.Kief is said, even in the age
of Yaroslaf, to have contained 400 churches; Vladimir nearly as many.Moscow, in the year 1600, had 400 (thirty-seven of which were in the
Kremlin), and now possesses many more.Many of the village churches still retain their ancient features; the
example here given of one near Novogorod belongs probably to the 12th
century, and is not later than the 13th.It retains its shafted apse,
its bulb-shaped Tartar dome, and, as is always the case in Russia, a
square detached belfry—though in this instance apparently more modern
than the edifice itself.378 is the type of a great number
of the old village churches, which, like the houses of the peasants, are
of wood, generally of logs laid one on the other, with their round ends
intersecting at the angles, like the log-huts of America at the present
day.As architectural objects they are of course insignificant, but
still they are characteristic and picturesque.Village Church near Tzarskoe Selo.Internally all the arrangements of the stone churches are such as are
appropriate for pictorial rather than for sculptural decoration.The
pillars are generally large cylinders covered with portraits of saints,
and the capitals are plain, cushion-like rolls with painted ornaments.The vaults are not relieved by ribs, or by any projections that could
interfere with the  decorations.In the wooden churches the
construction is plainly shown, and of course is far lighter.In them
also colour almost wholly supersedes carving.The peculiarities of these
two styles are well illustrated in the two Woodcuts, Nos.379 and 380,
from churches near Kostroma in Eastern Russia.Both belong to the Middle
Ages, and both are favourable specimens of their respective classes.In
these examples, as indeed in every Greek church, the principal object of
ecclesiastical furniture is the _iconostasis_ or image-bearer,
corresponding to the rood-screen that separates the choir from the nave
in Latin churches.The rood-screen, however, never assumed in the West
the importance which the iconostasis always possessed in the East.There
it separates and hides from the church the sanctuary and the altar, from
which the laity are wholly excluded.Within it the elements are
consecrated, in the presence of the priests alone, and are then brought
forward to be displayed to the public.On this screen, as performing so
important a part, the Greek architects and artists have lavished the
greatest amount of care and design, and in every Greek church, from St.Mark’s at Venice to the extreme confines of Russia, it is the object
that first attracts attention on entering.It is, in fact, so important
that it must be regarded rather as an object of architecture than of
church furniture.The architectural details of these Russian churches must be pronounced
to be bad; for, even making every allowance for difference of taste,
there is neither beauty of form nor constructive elegance in any part.The most characteristic and pleasing features are the five domes that
generally ornament the roofs, and which, when they rise from the
_extrados_, or uncovered outside of the vaults, certainly look well.Too
frequently, however, the vault is covered by a wooden roof, through
which the domes then peer in a manner by no means to be admired.The
details of the lower part are generally bad.381)
of a doorway of the Troitska monastery, near Moscow, is sufficiently
characteristic.Its most remarkable feature is the baluster-like
pillars, of which the Russians seem so fond.These support an arch with
a pendant in the middle—a sort of architectural _tour de force_ which
the Russian architects practised everywhere and in every age, but which
is far from being beautiful in itself, or from possessing any
architectural propriety.The great roll over the door is also
unpleasant.Indeed, as a general rule, wherever in Russian architecture
the details are original, they must be condemned as ugly.At Moscow we find much that is at all events curious.It first became a
city of importance about the year 1304, and retained its prosperity
throughout that century.During that time it was adorned by many
sumptuous edifices.In the beginning of the 15th century it was taken
and destroyed by the Tartars, and it was not till the reign of Ivan III.(1462-1505) that the city and empire recovered the disasters of that
period.It is extremely doubtful if any edifice now found in Moscow can
date before the time of this monarch.In the year 1479 this king dedicated the new church of the Assumption of
the Virgin, said to have been built by Aristotile Fioravanti, of
Bologna, in Italy, who was brought to Russia expressly for the purpose.382) gives a good idea of the arrangement of
a Russian church of this age.Small as are its dimensions—only 74 ft.by
56 over all externally, which would be a very small parish church
anywhere else—the two other cathedrals of Moscow, that of the Archangel
Michael and the Annunciation, are even smaller still in plan.Like true
Byzantine churches, they would all be exact squares, but that the
narthex being taken into the church gives it a somewhat oblong form.In
the Church of the Assumption there is, as is almost universally the
case, one large dome over the centre of the square, and four smaller
ones in the four angles.[255] The great iconostasis runs, as at Sta.Sophia at Kief, quite across the church; but the two lateral chapels
have smaller screens inside which hide their altars, so that the part
between the two becomes a sort of private chapel.This seems to be the
plan of the greater number of the Russian churches of this age.Doorway of the Troitzka Monastery, near Moscow.]Plan of the Church of the Assumption, Moscow.]View of the Church of Vassili Blanskenoy, Moscow.]But there is one church in Moscow, that of Vassili (St.Basil) Blajenny,
which is certainly the most remarkable, as it is the most
characteristic, of all the churches of Russia.It was built by Ivan the
Terrible (1534-1584), and its architect was a foreigner, generally
supposed to have come from the West, inasmuch as this monarch sent an
embassy to Germany under one Schlit, to procure artists, of whom he is
said to have collected 150 for his service.If, however, German workmen
erected this building, it certainly was from Tartar designs.Nothing
like it exists to the westward.It more resembles some Eastern pagoda of
modern date than any European structure, and in fact must be considered
as almost a pure Tartar building.Still, though strangely altered by
time, most of its forms can be traced back to the Byzantine style, as
certainly as the details of the cathedral of Cologne to the Romanesque.The central spire, for instance, is the form into which the Russians had
during five centuries been gradually changing the straight-lined dome of
the Armenians.The eight others are the Byzantine domes converted by
degrees into the bulb-like forms which the Tartars practised at Agra and
Delhi, as well as throughout Russia.The arrangement of these domes will
be understood by the plan (Woodcut No.383), which shows it to consist
of one central octagon surrounded by eight smaller ones, raised on a
platform ascended by two flights of stairs.Beneath the platform is a
crypt.For the general appearance the reader must be referred to Woodcut
No.384, for words would fail to convey any idea of so bizarre and
complicated a building.At the same time it must be imagined as painted
with the most brilliant colours; its domes gilt, and relieved by blue,
green, and red, and altogether a combination of as much barbarity as it
is possible to bring together in so small a space.To crown the whole,
according to the legend, Ivan ordered the eyes of the architect to be
put out, lest he should ever surpass his own handiwork; and we may feel
grateful that nothing so barbarous was afterwards attempted in Europe.View of Church at Kurtea d’Argyisch.(From ‘Jahrbuch
der Central Com.’)]

[Illustration: 386.Plan of Church at Kurtea d’Argyisch.Tower of Ivan Veliki, Moscow, with the Cathedrals of
the Assumption and the Archangel Gabriel.]Though not strictly speaking in Russia itself, there is at Kurtea
d’Argyisch, in Wallachia, 90 miles north-west from Bucharest, a church
which is so remarkable, so typical of the style, that it cannot be
passed over.It was erected in the first years of the 16th century
(1517-1526) by a Prince Nyagon, and is, so far as is at present known,
the most elaborate example of the style.All its ornamental details are
identical with those found at Ani and other places in Armenia, but are
used here in greater profusion and with better judgment than are to be
found in any single example in that country.In outline it is not so
wild as the Vassili Blanskenoy, but the interior is wholly sacrificed to
the external effect, and no other example can well be quoted on which
ornamental construction is carried to so great an extent, and generally
speaking in such good taste.The twisted cupolas that flank the
entrances might as well have been omitted, but the two central domes and
the way the semi-domes are attached to them are quite unexceptionable,
and altogether, with larger dimensions, and if a little more spread out,
it would be difficult to find a more elegant exterior anywhere.long by 50 wide it is too small for architectural effect,
but barring this it is the most elegant example of the Armeno-Russian or
Neo-Byzantine architecture which is known to exist anywhere, and one of
the most suggestive, if the Russians knew how to use it.[256]


                                TOWERS.Next in importance to the churches themselves are the belfries which
always accompany them.The Russians seem never to have adopted separate
baptisteries, nor did they affect any sepulchral magnificence in their
tombs.From the time of Herodotus the Scythians were great casters of
metal, and famous for their bells.The specimens of casting of this sort
in Russia reduce all the great bells of Western Europe to comparative
insignificance.It of course became necessary to provide places in which
to hang these bells: and as nothing, either in Byzantine or Armenian
architecture, afforded a hint for amalgamating the belfry with the
church, they went to work in their own way, and constructed the towers
wholly independent of the churches.Of all those in Russia, that of Ivan
Veliki, erected by the Czar Boris, about the year 1600, is the finest.It is surmounted by a cross 18 ft.high, making a total height of 269
ft.from the ground to the top of the cross.It cannot be said to have
any great beauty, either of form or detail: but it rises boldly from the
ground, and towers over all the other buildings of the Kremlin.With
this tower for its principal object, the whole mass of building is at
least picturesque, if not architecturally beautiful.388) the belfry is shown as it stood before it was blown up by the
French.It has since been rebuilt, and with the cathedrals on either
hand, makes up the best group in the Kremlin.Besides the belfries, the walls of the Kremlin are adorned with towers,
meant not merely for military defence, but as architectural ornaments,
and reminding us somewhat of those described by Josephus as erected by
Herod on the walls of Jerusalem.389),
built by the same Czar Boris who erected that last described, is a good
specimen of its class.It is one of the principal of those which give
the walls of the Kremlin their peculiar and striking character.These towers, however, are not peculiar to the Kremlin of Moscow.Every
city in Russia had its Kremlin, as every one in Spain had its Alcazar,
and all were adorned with walls deeply machicolated, and interspersed
with towers.Within were enclosed five-domed churches and belfries, just
as at Moscow, though on a scale proportionate to the importance of the
city.It would be easy to select numerous illustrations of this.They
are, however, all very much like one another, nor have they sufficient
beauty to require us to dwell long on them.Their gateways, however, are
frequently important.Every city had its _porta sacra_, deriving its
importance either from some memorable event or from miracles said to
have been wrought there, and being the triumphal gateways through which
all processions pass on state occasions.The best known of these is that of Moscow, beneath whose sacred arch
even the Emperor himself must uncover his head as he passes through; and
which, from its sanctity as well as its architectural character, forms
an important feature among the antiquities of Russia.So numerous are the churches, and, generally speaking, the fragments of
antiquity in this country, that it would be easy to multiply examples to
almost any extent.Those quoted in the preceding pages are,
architecturally, the finest as well as the most interesting from an
antiquarian point of view, of those which have yet been visited and
drawn; and there is no reason to believe that others either more
magnificent or more beautiful still remain undescribed.This being the case, it is safe to assert that Russia contains nothing
that can at all compare with the cathedrals, or even the parish
churches, of Western Europe, either in dimensions or in beauty of
detail.Every chapter in the history of architecture must contain
something to interest the student: but there is none less worthy of
attention than that which describes the architecture of Russia,
especially when we take into account the extent of territory occupied by
its people, and the enormous amount of time and wealth which has been
lavished on the multitude of insignificant buildings to be found in
every corner of the empire.CHAPTER I.

                             INTRODUCTORY.Division and Classification of the Romanesque and Gothic Styles of
  Architecture in Italy.If a historian were to propose to himself the task of writing a
tolerably consecutive narrative of the events which occurred in Italy
during the Middle Ages, he would probably find such difficulties in his
way as would induce him to abandon the attempt.Venice and Genoa were as
distinct states as Spain and Portugal.Florence, the most essentially
Italian of the republics, requires a different treatment from the half
German Milan.Even such neighbouring cities as Mantua and Verona were
separate and independent states during the most important part of their
existence.Rome was, during the whole of the Middle Ages, more European
than Italian, and must have a narrative of her own; Southern Italy was a
foreign country to the states of the North; and Sicily has an
independent history.The same difficulties, though not perhaps to the same degree, beset the
historian of art, and, if it were proposed to describe in detail all the
varying forms of Italian art during the Middle Ages, it would be
necessary to map out Italy into provinces, and to treat each almost as a
separate kingdom by itself.In this, as in almost every instance,
however, the architecture forms a better guide-line through the tangled
mazes of the labyrinth than the written record of political events, and
those who can read her language have before them a more trustworthy and
vivid picture of the past than can be obtained by any other means.The great charm of the history of Mediæval art in England is its unity.It affords the picture of a people working out a style from chaos to
completeness, with only slight assistance from those in foreign
countries engaged in the same task.In France we have two elements, the
old Southern Romanesque long struggling with the Northern Celtic, and
unity only obtained by the suppression of the former, wherever they came
in contact.In Italy we have four elements,—the Roman, the Byzantine,
the Lombardic, and the Gothic,—sometimes existing nearly pure, at others
mixed, in the most varying proportions, the one with the other.In the North the Lombardic element prevailed; based on the one hand on
the traditions of Imperial Rome, and in consequence influenced in its
art by classical forms; and, on the other, inspired in all its details
by a vast accumulation of Byzantine work.In the 5th and 6th centuries
this work (chiefly confined to columns, screens, and altar pieces) was
executed by Greek artists sent on from Constantinople.The 7th century
seems to have been quite barren so far as architecture was concerned;
but in the 8th century, owing either to the Saracen invasion or to the
emigration caused by the persecution of the Iconoclasts in 788, the
Byzantine influence became again predominant, but no longer with that
same purity of design as we find in the earlier work of the 5th and 6th
centuries.In the South, the Byzantine forms prevailed, partly because the art was
there based on the traditions of Magna Grecia, and more, perhaps, from
the intimate connection that existed between Apulia and the Peloponnesus
during the Middle Ages.Between the two stood Rome, less changed than either North or South—the
three terms, Roman, Romano-Byzantine, and Renaissance comprise all the
variation she submitted to.In vain the Gothic styles besieged her on
the north and the Byzantine on the south.Their waves spent themselves
on her rock without producing much impression, while her influence
extended more or less over the whole peninsula.It was distinctly felt
at Florence and at Pisa on the north and west, though these conquests
were nearly balanced by the Byzantine influence which is so distinctly
felt at Venice or Padua on the east coast.The great difficulty in the attempt to reconcile these architectural
varieties with the local and ethnographical peculiarities of the
people—a difficulty which at first sight appears all but insuperable—is,
that sometimes all three styles are found side by side in the same city.This, however, constitutes, in reality, the intrinsic merit of
architecture as a guide in these difficulties.What neither the language
of the people nor their histories tell us, their arts proclaim in a
manner not to be mistaken.Just in that ratio in which the Roman,
Byzantine, or Lombardic style prevails in their churches, to that extent
did either of these elements exist in the blood of the people.Once
thoroughly master the peculiarities of their art, and we can with
certainty pronounce when any particular race rose to power, how long its
prevalence lasted, and when it was obliterated or fused with some other
form.There is no great difficulty in distinguishing between the Byzantine and
the other two styles, so far as the form of dome is concerned.The
latter is almost always rounded externally, the former almost always
straight-lined.Again: the Byzantine architects never used intersecting
vaults for their naves.If forced to use a pointed arch, they did so
unwillingly, and it never fitted kindly to their favourite circular
forms; the style of their ornamentation was throughout peculiar, and
differed in many essential respects from the other two styles.It is less easy always to discriminate between the Gothic and Lombardic
in Italy.We frequently find churches of the two styles built side by
side in the same age, both using round arches, and with details not
differing essentially from one another.There is one test, however,
which is probably in all cases sufficient.Every Gothic church had, or
was intended to have, a vault over its central aisle.The importance of the distinction is apparent
throughout.The Gothic churches have clustered piers, tall
vaulting-shafts, external and internal buttresses, and are prepared
throughout for this necessity of Gothic art.The early Christian
churches, on the contrary, have only a range of columns, generally of a
pseudo-Corinthian order, between the central and side aisles; internally
no vaulting-shafts, and externally only pilasters.Had these architects
been competent, as the English were, to invent an ornamental wooden
roof, they would perhaps have acted wisely; but though they made several
attempts, especially at Verona, they failed signally to devise any mode
either of hiding the mere mechanical structure of their roofs or of
rendering them ornamental.Vaulting was, in fact, the real formative idea of the Gothic style, and
it continued to be its most marked characteristic during the continuance
of the style, not only in Italy, but throughout all Europe.As it is impossible to treat of these various styles in one sequence,
various modes of precedence might be adopted, for each of which good
reasons could be given; but the following will probably be found most
consonant with the arrangement elsewhere adopted in this work:—

First, to treat of the early Christian style as it prevailed in Italy
down to the age of Charlemagne, and to trace out its history down to the
11th century, in order to include all that work executed by Greek
artists or copied from it by Lombardic artists; a phase which might
appropriately be termed the Byzantine-Lombardic style.Secondly, to follow the history of the formation of the round-arched
style in Lombardy and North Italy, which constitutes the real Lombardic
style.Thirdly, to take up the Byzantine-Romanesque style as it was practised
in the centre and South of Italy; because it follows chronologically
more closely the art of the North of Italy.Fourthly, to follow the changes which the influence of the Gothic style
exercised in the 13th and 14th centuries in Italy.Sicily will demand a chapter to herself; not only because a fourth
element is introduced there in the Saracenic—which influenced her style
almost as much as it did that of the South of Spain—but because such
pointed Gothic as she possesses was not German, like that of Northern
Italy, but derived far more directly from France, under either the
Norman or Angiovine dynasties.Gothic architecture in Palestine also
requires a chapter, and is best described here owing to its close
resemblance to the style in the South of Italy.EARLY CHRISTIAN AND BYZANTINE-LOMBARDIC STYLES.Paul’s—Ravenna—St.Mark’s,

                               BASILICAS.Like the study of all modern history, that of Christian architecture
commences with Rome; and not, as is sometimes supposed, where the
history of Rome leaves off, but far back in the Empire, if not, indeed,
almost in the Republic.As has already been pointed out, the whole history of the art in
Imperial Rome is that of a style in course of transition, beginning with
a purely Pagan or Grecian style in the age of Augustus, and passing into
one almost wholly Christian in the age of Constantine.At the first epoch of the Empire the temple architecture of Rome
consisted in an external arrangement of columns, without arches or
vaults, and was wholly unsuited for the purposes of Christian worship.Towards the end of the period it had become an internal architecture,
making use of arches and vaults almost entirely to the exclusion of the
columnar orders, except as ornaments, and became so perfectly adapted to
Christian requirements, that little or no essential change in it has
taken place from that time to the present day.A basilica of the form
adopted in the first century after Constantine is as suited now as it
was then to the forms and ceremonies of the Christian ritual.The fact seems to be, that during the first three centuries after the
Christian era an immense change was silently but certainly working its
way in men’s minds.The old religion was effete: the best men, the most
intellectual spirits of the age, had no faith in it; and the new
religion with all its important consequences was gradually supplying its
place in the minds of men long before it was generally accepted.There is thus no real distinction between the Emilian or Ulpian
basilicas and those which Constantine erected for the use of the early
Christian republic.Nor is it possible, in such a series as the
Pantheon, the Temple of Minerva Medica, and the Church of San Vitale at
Ravenna, to point out what part really belongs to Pagan and what to
Christian art.It is true that Constantine fixed the epoch of completed transition, and
gave it form and substance; but long before his time Paganism was
impossible and a reform inevitable.The feeling of the world had
changed—its form of utterance followed as a matter of course.Viewed in this light, it is impossible to separate the early history of
Christian art from that of Imperial Rome.The sequence is so immediate
and the change so gradual, that a knowledge of the first is absolutely
indispensable to a right understanding of the second.One of the most remarkable facts connected with the early history of the
Christian religion is, that neither its Founder nor any of His more
immediate successors left any specific directions either as to the
liturgical forms of worship to be observed by His followers, nor laid
down any rules to be observed in the government of the newly established
Church.Under these circumstances it was left almost wholly to those to
whose care the infant congregation was entrusted to frame such
regulations for its guidance as the exigencies of the occasion might
dictate, and gradually to appoint such forms of worship as might seem
most suitable to express the purity of the new faith, but at the same
time with a dignity befitting its high mission.In Judea these ceremonies, as might naturally be expected, were strongly
tinctured with the forms of the Mosaic dispensation; but it appears to
have been in Africa, and more especially in the pomp-loving and
ceremonious Egypt, that fixed liturgies and rites first became an
integral part of the Christian religion.In those countries far from the
central seat of government, more liberty of conscience seems to have
been attained at an early period than would have been tolerated in the
capital.Before the time of Constantine they possessed not only
churches, but a regularly established hierarchy and a form of worship
similar to what afterwards obtained throughout the whole Christian
world.The form of the government of the Church, however, was long
unsettled.At first it seems merely to have been that the most respected
individuals of each isolated congregation were selected to form a
council to advise and direct their fellow-Christians, to receive and
dispense their alms, and, under the simple but revered title of
Presbyters, to act as fathers rather than as governors to the scattered
communities by which they were elected.The idea, however, of such a
council naturally includes that of a president to guide their
deliberations and give unity and force to their decisions; and such we
soon find springing up under the title of Bishops, or Presbyter Bishops,
as they were first called.During the course of the second century the
latter institution seems gradually to have gained strength at the
expense of the power of the Presbyters, whose delegate the Bishop was
assumed to be.In that capacity the Bishops not only took upon
themselves the general direction of the affairs of the Church, but
formed themselves into separate councils and synods, meeting in the
provincial capitals of the provinces where they were located.These
meetings took place under the presidency of the Bishop of the city in
which they met, who thus assumed to be the chief or metropolitan.These
formed a new presbytery above the older institution, which was thus
gradually superseded—to be again surpassed by the great councils which,
after the age of Constantine, formed the supreme governing body of the
Church; performing the functions of the earlier provincial synods with
more extended authority, though with less unanimity and regularity than
had characterised the earlier institution.It was thus that during the first three centuries of its existence the
Christian community was formed into a vast federal republic, governed by
its own laws, administered by its own officers, acknowledging no
community with the heathen and no authority in the constituted secular
powers of the State.But at the same time the hierarchy admitted a
participation of rights to the general body of the faithful, from whom
they were chosen, and whose delegation was still admitted to be their
title to office.When, in the time of Constantine, this persecuted and scattered Church
emerged from the Catacombs to bask in the sunshine of Imperial favour,
there were no buildings in Rome, the plan of which was more suited to
their purposes than that of the basilicas of the ancient city.Though
designed and erected for the transaction of the affairs of the heathen
Empire, they happened to be, in consequence of their disposition and
immense size, eminently suited for the convenience of the Christian
Church, which then aspired to supersede its fallen rival and replace it
by a younger and better institution.[257]

In the basilica the whole congregation of the faithful could meet and
take part in the transaction of the business going on.The bishop
naturally took the place previously occupied by the prætor or quæstor,
the presbyters those of the assessors.The altar in front of the apse,
where the pious heathen poured out libations at the commencement and
conclusion of all important business, served equally for the celebration
of Christian rites, and with the fewest possible changes, either in the
form of the ceremonies or in the nature of the business transacted
therein, the basilica of the heathen became the ecclesia or place of
assembly of the early Christian community.In addition, however, to the rectangular basilica, which was essentially
the place of meeting for the transaction of the business of the Church,
the Christian community early adopted a circular-formed edifice as a
ceremonial or sacramental adjunct to the basilica.These were copied
from the Roman tombs above described, and were in fact frequently built
for the sepulchres of distinguished persons; but they were also used at
a very early date as baptisteries, as well as for the performance of
funereal rites.It does not appear that baptism, the marriage rites, or
indeed any of the sacraments, were performed in the earliest ages in the
basilica, though in after ages a font was introduced even into
cathedrals.The rectangular church became ultimately the only form used.In the earlier ages, however, a complete ecclesiastical establishment
consisted of a basilica, and a baptistery, independent of one another
and seldom ranged symmetrically, though the tendency seems to have been
to place the round church opposite the western or principal entrance of
the basilica.Though this was the case in the capital and other great cities, it was
otherwise before the time of Constantine in the provinces.There the
Christian communities existed as members of a religious sect long before
they aspired to political power or dreamt of superseding the secular
form of government by combination among themselves.In the remote parts
of the Empire, in the earliest ages, they consequently built for
themselves churches which were temples, or, in other words, houses of
prayer, designed for and devoted wholly to the celebration of religious
rites, as in the Pagan temples, and without any reference to the
government of the community or the transaction of the business of the
assembly.If any such existed in Italy or any other part of Europe, they
either perished in the various persecutions to which the Christians were
exposed when located near the seat of government, or they became
hallowed by the memories of the times of martyrdom, and were rebuilt in
happier days with greater magnificence, so that little or no trace of
the original buildings now remains.So long, therefore, as our
researches were confined to European examples, the history of Christian
architecture began with Constantine; but recent researches in Africa
have shown that, when properly explored, we shall certainly be able to
carry the history of the early Christian style in that country back to a
date at least a century before his time.In Syria and Asia Minor so many
early examples have come to light that it seems probable that we may,
before long, carry the history of Byzantine art back to a date nearly
approaching that of the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus.It is,
however, only so recently that the attention of ecclesiologists has been
directed to the early examples of Christian architecture, that it is not
yet possible to grasp completely the whole bearing of the subject; but
enough is known to show how much the progress of research may modify the
views hitherto entertained on the subject.Meanwhile too much attention
can hardly be bestowed upon it, as it is by means of these early
specimens of architectural art that we shall probably be best able to
recover the primitive forms of the Christian liturgical observance.One of the most ancient as well as interesting of the African churches
which has yet been brought to light is that at Djemla.It is a simple
rectangle, internally 92 ft.by 52, divided longitudinally with three
aisles, the centre one of which terminates in a square cella or choir,
which seems to have been enclosed up to the roof; but the building is so
ruined that this cannot be known for a certainty.Though so exceptional,
it is not difficult to see whence the form was derived.If we take such
a plan, for instance, as that of the Maison Carré at Nîmes (Woodcut No.187), and build a wall round and put a roof over it, so as to make a
building which was originally appropriated to external worship suitable
for internal religious purposes, we should have exactly such a result as
this.The cella must be diminished in extent, the pillars more widely
spaced, and the front row converted into a wall in which the entrances
would be usually placed.In this instance the one entrance, for some
local reason, is lateral.The whole floor of the church is covered with
a mosaic so purely classical in style of execution as to leave no doubt
as to its early date.A more common form is shown in the annexed woodcut, representing a small
church at Announa, likewise in Algeria, about 45 ft.square, divided
into three aisles and with a projecting apse.If we turn to the plan of
the Temple of Mars Ultor (Woodcut No.186), we see at once whence this
form was derived.It only requires the lateral columns to be brought
slightly forward to effect the requisite change.When the building was
to be used by a congregation, and not merely for display, the pillars
would require to be more widely spaced.A third form, from Ibrim in Nubia, shows the peculiarity of the apse
being internal, which became very fashionable in the Eastern, though not
so much so in the Western, churches, but still sufficiently so to make
its introduction at this early age worthy of notice.The building is
small, being only 57 ft.in length externally, but is remarkable for
being built with something of the solidity of the Egyptian edifices
among which it stands.The next example which it may be necessary to quote to make this early
form intelligible, is that of the church of St.Reparatus, near
Orleansville—the ancient Castellum Tingitanum.According to an
inscription still existing, it was erected A.D.252,[258] but the second
apse seems to have been added at a later date, to contain the grave of
the saint.As it now stands, it is a double-apsed basilica 80 ft.long
by 52 broad, divided into five aisles, and exhibiting on a miniature
scale all the peculiarities of plan which we have hitherto fancied were
not adopted until some centuries later.In this instance both the apses
are internal, so that the side-aisles are longer than the centre one, no
portion of them appearing to have been cut off for chalcidica or
vestries, as was very generally the case in this age.Another example, very much like this in arrangement, but on a larger
scale, is found at Ermet, the ancient Hermonthis in Egypt.by 90, and, if the plan in the great French work[259]
is to be depended upon, is one of the most complete examples of its
class.It has four ranges of columns, taken apparently from more ancient
examples, and two apses with all the usual appurtenances.Plan of Church at Ibrim in Nubia.Another two-aisled and single apse church, measuring 100 ft.by 65,
called Dyer Abou Taneh, is represented in the same work;[260] but
perhaps the most interesting of these churches is that known as the
White Convent, situated on the edge of the Libyan Desert, above Siout.by 122, and is enclosed in a solid wall,
surmounted by an Egyptian cornice, so that it looks much more like an
ancient temple than a Christian church.Originally it had six doors, but
all are now walled up, except one in the centre of the southern face;
and above, a series of small openings, like loopholes, admitted light to
apartments which apparently occupied the upper storey of lateral
corridors.Light to the church was, of course, admitted through the
clerestory, which could easily be done; and altogether as a fortified
and mysterious abode, and place of worship of ascetics, it would be
difficult to find a more appropriate example.The age of this church is not very well ascertained; popularly it is,
like so many others, ascribed to Sta.Helena, and the double aisles and
triapsal arrangements are so like her church at Bethlehem, that there is
no _à priori_ improbability in the assumption.The plan, however, is
more complicated and complete, and its external form bespeaks of
troublous times, so that altogether it is probably a century or two (the
monks say 140 years) more modern.Like other churches of its class,
ancient materials have been so used up with those prepared at the time,
that it is extremely difficult to ascertain the dates of such buildings.If, however, any one with sufficient knowledge would make a special
study of these Egyptian churches, he would add one of the most
interesting chapters to our history of early Christian Architecture, and
explain many ritual arrangements whose origin is now involved in
mystery; but for this we must wait.The materials are not at present
available, all travellers in Egypt being so attracted by the surpassing
interest of the Pagan remains of that country, as hardly to find time
for a glance at the Christian antiquities.[261]

[Illustration: 394.It was probably in a great measure owing to the influence of these
provincial examples that the arrangements of the metropolitan basilicas
were not long allowed to retain the form above described, though more
was probably due to the change which was gradually taking place in the
constitution of the governing body of the Church.The early arrangements
of the Christian basilica, as copied from the secular forms of the Pagan
places of assembly, soon became unsuited to the more exclusively
religious purposes to which they were to be appropriated.The now
dominant hierarchy of Rome soon began to repudiate the republicanism of
the early days of the Church, and to adopt from the East the convenient
doctrine of the absolute separation of the congregation into clergy and
laity.To accommodate the basilica to this new state of things, first
the apse was railed off and appropriated wholly to the use of the
clergy: then the whole of the dais, or raised part in front of the apse
on which the altar stood, was separated by pillars, called cancelli, and
in like manner given up wholly to the clergy, and was not allowed to be
profaned by the presence of the unordained multitude.The last great change was the introduction of a choir, or enclosed space
in the centre of the nave, attached to the bema or _presbytery_, as the
raised space came to be called.Round three sides of this choir the
faithful were allowed to congregate to hear the Gospels or Epistles read
from the two pulpits or _ambones_, which were built into its enclosure,
one on either side; or to hear the services which were read or sung by
the inferior order of clergy who occupied its precincts.The enclosure of the choir was kept low, so as not to hide the view of
the raised presbytery, or to prevent the congregation from witnessing
the more sacred mysteries of the faith which were there performed by the
higher order of clergy.Another important modification, though it entailed no architectural
change, was the introduction of the bodies of the saints in whose honour
the building was erected into the basilica itself, and depositing them
in a confessional or crypt below the high altar.There is every reason to believe that a separate circular building, or
proper tomb, was originally erected over the grave or place of
martyrdom, and the basilica was sanctified merely by its propinquity to
the sacred spot.Afterwards the practice of depositing the relics of the
saint beneath the floor became universally the rule.At about the same
time the baptistery was also absorbed into the basilica; and instead of
standing opposite the western entrance, a font placed within the western
doors supplied its place.This last change was made earlier at Rome than
elsewhere.It is not known at what exact period the alteration was
introduced, but it is probable that the whole was completed before the
age of Gregory the Great.It was thus that in the course of a few centuries the basilicas
aggregated within themselves all the offices of the Roman Church, and
became the only acknowledged ecclesiastical buildings—either as places
for the assembly of the clergy for the administration of the sacraments
and the performance of divine worship, or for the congregation of the
faithful.None of the basilican churches, either of Rome or the provinces, possess
these arrangements exactly as they were originally established in the
fourth or fifth century.The church of San Clemente, however, retains
them so nearly in their primitive form that a short description of it
may tend to make what follows more easily intelligible.This basilica
seems to have been erected in the fourth or fifth century over what was
supposed to be the house in which the saint of that name resided.Recently a subterranean church or crypt has been discovered, which must
of course be more ancient than the present remains.[262] Above this
subterranean church stands the edifice shown in the accompanying plan
(Woodcut No.395), nearly one-third less in size, being only 65 ft.wide
internally, against 93 of the original church, though both were about
the same length.Plan of the Church of San Clemente at Rome.(From
Gutensohn and Knapp.to 1 in]

It is one of the few that still possesses an _atrium_ or courtyard in
front of the principal entrance, though there can be but little doubt
that this was considered at that early age a most important, if not
indeed an indispensable, attribute to the church itself.As a feature it
may have been derived from the East, where we know it was most common,
and where it afterwards became, with only the slightest possible
modifications, the mosque of the Moslems.It would seem even more
probable, however, that it is only a repetition of the _forum_, which
was always attached to the Pagan basilica, and through which it was
always entered; and for a sepulchral church at least nothing could be
more appropriate, as the original application of the word forum seems to
have been to the open area that existed in front of tombs as well as of
other important buildings.[264]

In the centre of this atrium there generally stood a fountain or tank of
water, not only as an emblem of purity, but that those who came to the
church might wash their hands before entering the holy place—a custom
which seems to have given rise to the practice of dipping the fingers in
the holy water of the piscina, now universal in all Catholic countries.The colonnade next the church was frequently the only representative of
the atrium, and then—perhaps indeed always—was called the _narthex_, or
place for penitents or persons who had not yet acquired the right of
entering the church itself.From this narthex three doorways generally opened into the church,
corresponding with the three aisles; and if the building possessed a
font, it ought to have been placed in one of the chapels on either the
right or left hand of the principal entrance.The choir, with its two pulpits, is shown in the plan—that on the
left-hand side being the pulpit of the Epistle, that on the right of the
Gospel.The railing of the _bema_ or presbytery is also marked, so is
the position of the altar with its canopy supported on four pillars, and
behind that the throne of the bishop, with the seats of the inferior
clergy surrounding the apse on either side.Besides the church of San Clemente there are at least thirty other
basilican churches in Rome, extending in date from the 4th to the 14th
century.Their names and dates, as far as they have been ascertained,
are set forth in the accompanying list, which, though not altogether
complete, is still the best we possess, and is sufficient for our
present purpose.[265]

Three of these, St.Paul’s, and the Lateran church, have
five aisles, all the rest three, with only one insignificant exception,
Sta.Balbina, which has no side-aisles.Agnes and the old part
of St.Lorenzo, have their side-aisles in two storeys, all the rest are
only one storey in height, and the side-aisles generally are half the
width of the central aisle or nave.Some of the more modern churches
have the side-aisles vaulted, but of those in the list all except the
two last have flat wooden ceilings over the central compartment, and
generally speaking the plain ornamental construction of the roof is
exposed.It can scarcely be doubted that originally they were ceiled in
some more ornamental manner, as the art of ornamenting this new style of
open construction seems to have been introduced at a later date.(From Gutensohn and Knapp.)Maria sopra Minerva might perhaps be
more properly classed among the buildings belonging to the Italian
Gothic style; but as it is the only one in Rome that has any claim to
such a distinction, it is hardly worth while making it an exception to
the rest.The San Agostino might also be called a Renaissance specimen.It certainly is a transitional specimen between the pillared and
pilastered styles, which were then struggling for mastery.It may either
be regarded as the last of the old race or the first of the new style,
which was so soon destined to revolutionise the architectural world.Of the other examples the oldest was the finest.This great basilica was
erected in the reign of Constantine, close to the circus of Nero, where
tradition affirmed that St.It
unfortunately was entirely swept away to make room for the greatest of
Christian temples, which now occupies its site; but previous to its
destruction careful measurements and drawings were made of every part,
from which it is easy to understand all its arrangements—easier perhaps
than if it had remained to the present day, and four centuries more of
reform and improvements had assisted in altering and disfiguring its
venerable frame.As will be seen in the plan (Woodcut No.396), drawn to the usual scale,
it possessed a noble atrium or forecourt, 212 ft.by 235, in front of
which were some bold masses of building, which, during the Middle Ages,
were surmounted by two belfry-towers.in
width by 380 in length, covering, without its adjuncts, an area of above
80,000 English feet, which, though less than half the size of the
present cathedral, is as large as that covered by any mediæval cathedral
except those of Milan and Seville.across (about twice the average width of a Gothic nave), and nearly the
same as that of the basilica of Maxentius and the principal halls of the
greater thermæ.For some reason or other this dimension seems to have
been a modulus very generally adopted.The bema or sanctuary, answering
to the Gothic transept, extended beyond the walls of the church either
way, which was unusual in early Christian buildings.The object here
seems to have been to connect it with the tombs on its north side.The
arrangement of the sanctuary was also peculiar, having been adorned with
twelve pillars supporting a gallery.These, when symbolism became the
fashion, were said to represent the twelve apostles.This certainly was
not their original intent, as at first only six were put up—the others
added afterwards.The sanctuary and choir were here singularly small and
contracted, as if arranged before the clergy became so numerous as they
afterwards were, and before the laity were excluded from this part of
the church.The general internal appearance of the building will be understood from
the following woodcut (No.397), which presents at one view all the
peculiarities of the basilican buildings.The pillars separating the
central from the side aisles appear to have been of uniform dimensions,
and to have supported a horizontal entablature, above which rose a
double range of panels, each containing a picture—these panels thus
taking the place of what was the triforium in Gothic churches.Over
these was the clerestory, and again an ornamental belt gave sufficient
elevation for the roof, which in this instance showed the naked
construction.On the whole perhaps the ratio of height to width is
unexceptionable, but the height over the pillars is so great that they
are made to look utterly insignificant, which indeed is the great defect
in the architectural design of these buildings, and, though seldom so
offensive as here, is apparent in all.The ranges of columns dividing
the side-aisles were joined by arches, which is a more common as well as
a better arrangement, as it not only adds to the height of the pillars,
but gives them an apparent power of bearing the superstructure.At some
period during the Middle Ages the outer aisles were vaulted, and Gothic
windows introduced into them.This change seems to have necessitated the
closing of the intermediate range of clerestory windows, which probably
was by no means conducive to the general architectural effect of the
building.Peter, before its
destruction in the 15th century.Externally this basilica, like all those of its age, must have been
singularly deficient in beauty or in architectural design.The sides
were of plain unplastered brick, the windows were plain arch-headed
openings.The front alone was ornamented, and this only with two ranges
of windows somewhat larger than those at the sides, three in each tier,
into which tracery was inserted at some later period, and between and
above these, various figures and emblems were painted in fresco on
stucco laid on the brickwork.The whole was surmounted by that singular
coved cornice which seems to have been universal in Roman basilicas,
though not found anywhere else that I am aware of.The two most interesting adjuncts to this cathedral were the two tombs
standing to the northward.According to the mediæval tradition the one
was the tomb of Honorius and his wives, the other the church of St.Their position, however, carefully centred on the spina of the
circus of Nero, where the great apostle suffered martyrdom, seems to
point to a holier and more important origin.My own conviction is that
they were erected to mark the places where the apostle and his
companions suffered.It is besides extremely improbable that after the
erection of the basilica an emperor should choose the centre of a circus
for the burying-place of himself and his family, or that he should be
permitted to choose so hallowed a spot.They are of exactly the usual
tomb-form of the age of Constantine, and of the largest size, being each
100 ft.The first was destroyed by Michael Angelo, as it stood on the site
required for his northern tribune, the second by Pius VI., in 1776, to
make way for the present sacristy, and Rome thus lost, through pure
carelessness, the two oldest and most sacred edifices of the Christian
period which she possessed.The most eastern had been so altered and overlaid, having been long used
as a sacristy,[266] that it might have been difficult to restore it; but
its position and its antiquity certainly entitled it to a better fate.The church of San Paolo fuori le Mura was almost an exact counterpart of
St.Peter’s both in design and dimensions.The only important variations
were that the transept was made of the same width as the central nave,
or about 80 ft., and that the pillars separating the nave from the
side-aisles were joined by arches instead of by a horizontal architrave.Both these were undoubted improvements, the first giving space and
dignity to the bema, the latter not only adding height to the order, but
giving it, together with lightness, that apparent strength requisite to
support the high wall placed over the pillars.Paul’s, at Rome, before
the fire.]The order too was finer and more important than at St.Peter’s,
twenty-four of the pillars being taken from some temple or building (it
is generally said the mausoleum of Hadrian) of the best age of Rome,
though the remaining sixteen were unfortunately only very bad copies of
them.in height, or one-third of the whole
height of the building to the roof.Peter’s they were only a
fourth, and if they had been spaced a little farther apart, and the arch
made more important, the most glaring defect of these buildings would in
a great measure have been avoided.Long before its destruction by fire in 1822 this church had been so
altered as to lose many of its most striking peculiarities.The bema or
presbytery was divided into two by a longitudinal wall.The greater
number of its clerestory windows were built up, its atrium gone, and
decay and whitewash had done much to efface its beauty, which
nevertheless seems to have struck all travellers with admiration, as
combining in itself the last reminiscence of Pagan Rome with the
earliest forms of the Christian world.It certainly was the most
interesting, if not quite the most beautiful, of the Christian
buildings, of that city.[267]

The third five-aisled basilica, that of St.John Lateran, differs in no
essential respect from those just described except in dimensions; it
covers about 60,000 ft., and consequently is inferior in this respect to
the other two.It has been so completely altered in modern times that
its primitive arrangements can now hardly be discerned, nor can their
effect be judged of, even assuming that they were peculiar to it, which,
however, is by no means certain.Like the other two, it appears to have been originally erected by
Constantine, who seems especially to have affected this five-aisled
form.The churches which he erected at Jerusalem and Bethlehem both have
this number of aisles.From the similarity which exists in the design of
all these churches we might easily restore this building, if it were
worth while.Its dimensions can easily be traced, but beyond this
nothing remains of the original erection.Of those with three aisles by far the finest and most beautiful is that
of S. Maria Maggiore, which, notwithstanding the comparative smallness
of its dimensions, is now perhaps the best specimen of its class
remaining.in width by 250 to the
front of the apse; the whole area being about 32,000 ft.: so that it is
little more than half the size of the Lateran church, and between
one-third and one-fourth of that of the other two five-aisled churches.Notwithstanding this, there is great beauty in its internal colonnade,
all the pillars of which are of one design, and bear a most pleasing
proportion to the superstructure.The clerestory too is ornamented with
pilasters and panels, making it a part of the general design; and with
the roof, which is panelled with constructive propriety and simplicity
combined with sufficient richness, serves to make up a whole which gives
a far better and more complete idea of what a basilica either was
originally, or at least might have been, than any other church at Rome.It is true that both the pilasters of the clerestory and the roof are
modern, and in modern times the colonnade has been broken through in two
places; but these defects must be overlooked in judging of the whole.Another defect is that the side-aisles have been vaulted in modern
times, and in such a manner as to destroy the harmony that should exist
between the different parts of the building.In striving to avoid the
defect of making the superstructure too high in proportion to the
columns, the architect has made the central roof too low either for the
width or length of the main aisle.Still the building, as a whole, is—or
rather was before the completion of the rebuilding of St.Paul’s—the
very best of the older wooden-roofed churches of Christendom, and the
best model from which to study the merits and defects of this style of
architecture.(From Gutensohn and
Knapp.)](From Gutensohn and Knapp.)Another mode of getting over the great defect of high walls over the
pillars was adopted, as in St.Agnese, of using a
gallery corresponding with the triforium of Gothic churches.Lorenzo, where this feature first occurs, it would seem to have been
derived from the Eastern Empire, where the custom of providing galleries
for women had long been established; this is rendered probable by the
fact that the sculpture of the capitals carrying the arches of the
triforium is of pure Byzantine character, and by the adoption of what is
virtually a dosseret,[268] or projecting impost above the capital to
carry the arches, which at their springing are considerably wider and
deeper than the abacus of the capital.According to M. Cattaneo[269] the
earliest part of this church is the Eastern end, built by Constantine
(see plan, Woodcut No.403), which first consisted of nave, aisles, and
a Western apse.In the Pontificate of Sixtus III.(432-440) an immense
basilica was added on the Western side with an Eastern apse built back
to back with the original apse; and later on, in 578-590, galleries were
added to the Western church by Pope Pelagius II.In 1226-1227, when Honorius III.restored the whole building, he removed
the two apses, continued the new arcade up to the early Western wall,
and raised the choir of the early church to its present elevation
(Woodcut No.Agnes the galleries may
have been suggested if not required by the peculiarity of the ground,
which was higher on one side than on the other; but whether this was the
true cause of its adoption or not, the effect was most satisfactory, and
had it been persevered in so as to bring the upper colonnade more into
harmony of proportion with the other, it would have been attended with
the happiest results on the style.Whether it was, however, that the
Romans felt the want of the broad plain space for their paintings, or
that they could not bring the upper arches into proportion with the
classical pillars which they made use of, the system was abandoned
almost as soon as adopted, and never came into general use.It should be observed that this arrangement contained the germs of much
that was afterwards reproduced in Gothic churches.The upper gallery,
after many modifications, at last settled into a triforium, and the
pierced stone slabs in the windows became tracery—but before these were
reached a vaulted roof was introduced, and with it all the features of
the style were to a great extent modified.Lorenzo (fuori le
Mura).]Pudentiana is one of the very oldest
and consequently one of the most interesting of those in Rome.It stands
on substructions of ancient Roman date, which probably formed part of
the Thermæ of Novatus or the house of the Senator Pudens, who is
mentioned by St.Paul at the end of his Second Epistle to Timothy, and
with whom he is traditionally said to have resided during his sojourn in
Rome.The vaults beneath the church certainly formed part of a Roman
mansion, so apparently do those buildings, shown on the plan, and placed
behind and on one side of the sanctuary; but whether these were used for
Christian purposes before the erection of the church in the fourth
century is by no means certain.In plan the church remains in all
probability very much as originally designed, its most striking
peculiarity being the segmental form of the apse, which may possibly
have arisen from some peculiar arrangement of the original building.It
was not, however, found to be pleasing in an architectural point of
view, and was not consequently again employed.The annexed section probably represents very nearly the original form of
the nave, though it has been so encrusted with modern accretions as to
render it difficult to ascertain what the first form really was.The
shafts of the pillars may have been borrowed from some older edifice,
but the capitals were clearly designed to support arches, and must
therefore be early Christian (fourth century?), and are among the most
elegant and appropriate specimens of the class now extant.In some instances, as in San Clemente, above alluded to, in San Pietro
in Vincula, and Sta.Maria in Cosmedin, the colonnade is divided into
spaces of three or four intercolumniations by piers of solid masonry,
which give great apparent solidity and strength to the building, but at
the expense of breaking it up into compartments more than is agreeable,
and these destroy that beauty of perspective so pleasing in a continuous
colonnade.This defect seems to have been felt in the Santa Praxede,
where three of these piers are introduced in the length of the
nave,[271] and support each a bold arch thrown across the central aisle.The effect of this might have been most happy, as at San Miniato, near
Florence; but it has been so clumsily managed in the Roman example, as
to be most destructive of all beauty of proportion.Half Section, half Elevation, of the Church of San
Vincenzo alle Tre Fontane.(From Gutensohn and Knapp.)Some of the principal beauties as well as some of the most remarkable
defects of these basilican churches arise from the employment of columns
torn from ancient temples: where this has been done, the beauty of the
marble, and the exquisite sculpture of the capitals and friezes, give a
richness and elegance to the whole that go far to redeem or to hide the
rudeness of the building in which they are encased.But, on the other
hand, the discrepancy between the pillars—Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian
columns being sometimes used side by side—destroys all uniformity, and
the fragmentary character of the entablatures they support is still more
prejudicial to the continuity of the perspective, which should be the
greatest charm of these churches.By degrees, the fertile quarries of
ancient Rome seem to have become entirely exhausted; and as the example
of St.Paul’s proves, the Romans in the fourth century were incapable of
manufacturing even a bad imitation, and were at last forced to adopt
some new plan of supporting their arcades.Nereo ed
Achilleo is, perhaps, the most elegant example of this class, the piers
being light octagons; but the most characteristic, as well as the most
original, is the San Vincenzo alle Tre Fontane, shown in section and
elevation in Woodcut No.It so far deviates from the usual
basilican arrangements as to suggest a later date.It has the same
defect as all the rest—its pier arches being too low, and for which
there is no excuse here—but both internally and externally it shows a
uniformity of design and a desire to make every part ornamental that
produces a very pleasing effect, notwithstanding that the whole is
merely of brick, and that ornament is so sparingly applied as barely to
prevent the building sinking into the class of mere utilitarian
erections.Among the most pleasing architectural features, if they may be so
called, of these churches, are the mosaic pavements that adorn the
greater number.These were always original, being designed for the
buildings in which they are used, and following the arrangement of the
architecture surrounding them.The patterns too are always elegant, and
appropriate to the purpose; and as the colours are in like manner
generally harmoniously blended, they form not only a most appropriate
but most beautiful basement to the architecture.A still more important feature was the great mosaic picture that always
adorned the semi-dome of the apse, representing most generally the
Saviour seated in glory surrounded by saints, or else some scene from
the life of the holy personage to whom the church was dedicated.These mosaics were generally continued down to nearly the level of the
altar, and along the whole of the inner wall of the sanctuary in which
the apse was situated, and as far as the triumphal arch which separated
the nave from the sanctuary, at which point the mosaic blended with the
frescoes that adorned the upper walls of the central nave above the
arcades.All this made up an extent of polychromatic decoration which in
those dark ages, when few could read, the designers of these buildings
seem to have considered as virtually of more importance than the
architectural work to which it was attached.Any attempt to judge of the
one without taking into consideration the other, would be forming an
opinion on hearing but half the evidence; but taken in conjunction, the
paintings go far to explain, and also to redeem, many points in which
the architecture is most open to criticism.During the whole period of the development of early Christian
architecture in Rome, the city of Ravenna, owing to her close connection
with the Eastern empire, almost rivalled in importance the old capital
of the world, and her churches were consequently hardly less important
either in number or in richness than those we have just been describing.It is true she had none so large as the great metropolitan basilicas of
St.The one five-aisled church she possessed—the
cathedral—has been entirely destroyed, to make way for a very
contemptible modern erection.From the plans, however, which we possess
of it, it seems to have differed very considerably from the Roman
examples, most especially in having no trace of a transept, the building
being a perfectly regular parallelogram, half as long again as its
breadth, and with merely one great apse added at the end of the central
nave.Its loss is the more to be regretted, as it was, besides being the
largest, the oldest church in the city, having been erected about the
year 400, by Archbishop Ursus.The baptistery that belonged to it has
been fortunately preserved, and will be described hereafter.Besides a considerable number of other churches which have either been
lost or destroyed by repair, Ravenna still possesses two first-class
three-aisled basilicas—the San Apollinare Nuovo,[272] originally an
Arian church, built by Theodoric, king of the Goths (A.D.493-525); and
the S. Apollinare in Classe, at the Port of Ravenna, situated about
three miles from the city, commenced A.D.538, and dedicated 549 A.D.Of
the two, the first-named is by far the more considerable, being 315 ft.long by 115 in width externally, while the other only measures 216 ft.As will be seen by the plan, S. Apollinare in Classe
is a perfectly regular basilica with twelve pillars on each side of the
nave, which is 50 ft.The apse is raised to allow of a crypt
underneath, and externally it is polygonal, like the Byzantine apse.Arches in Church of San Apollinare Nuovo.[273])]

The great merit of these two basilicas, as compared with those of Rome,
arises from the circumstance of Ravenna having possessed no ruined
temples whose spoils could be used in the construction of new buildings.On the other hand the Goths had no architectural forms of their own; the
architects and workmen therefore who were brought over from
Constantinople reproduced the style with which they were best acquainted
in the East, with such alterations in plan as the liturgies of the
church required, such modifications in construction as the materials of
the country necessitated, and such ideas in architectural design as were
suggested by the examples in Rome with which Theodoric was well
acquainted, having not only restored some of the churches there, but
insisted that the primitive style should be adhered to.The simple
basilican form of church with nave, and aisles without galleries over,
and a single apse, was based on numerous examples existing in Rome, to
which source may be ascribed the external blind arcades of the aisle and
nave walls.[274] From Woodcut 410, representing the arches of the nave
of St.Apollinare Nuovo, it will be seen that an elegance of proportion
is revealed and a beauty of design shown in the details of the
capitals[275] and the dosserets which surmount them, which are quite
foreign to any Roman examples.The great triforium frieze above the
arches, and the wall space above them between the clerestory windows,
covered with mosaics, executed 570 A.D.by Greek artists from
Constantinople, suggest a completeness of design which had not been
reached in Rome.All this is still more apparent in Woodcut No.411,
taken from the arcade where the nave joins the apse in St.Apollinare in
Classe, which shows a further advance in the working out of a new style,
based partially on Roman work, but carried out by Byzantine artists.Part of Apse in S. Apollinare in Classe, Ravenna.S. Apollinare in Classe, Ravenna.Externally these buildings appear to have remained to the present hour
almost wholly without architectural embellishment.It was considered
sufficient for ornamental purposes to make the brick arches necessary
for the construction slightly more prominent and important than was
actually required.As if impelled by some feeling of antagonism to the
practice of the heathens, the early Christians seem to have tried to
make the external appearance of their buildings as unlike those of their
predecessors as was possible.Whether this was the cause or not, it is
certain that nothing can well be less ornamental than these exteriors;
and even the _narthex_,[276] which in the Apollinare in Classe afforded
an excellent opportunity for embellishment, could not be less ornamental
if it were the entrance to a barn instead of to a church of such
richness and beauty as this in all its internal arrangements.The restoration of portions of the Cathedral of St.Mark during the past
twenty years, and the careful examination of various documents in the
archives of that city have led to the discovery that the work attributed
to Doge Pietro Orseolo, 976-78, consisted mainly in the re-construction
of the basilican church erected by the Doge Jean Participazio in 829-32,
and burnt in 976.Mark the
Evangelist, brought from Alexandria in 828 (when the Mohametans pulled
down the church of St.Mark in that town), determined Jean’s brother
Justinian to build a church which should be worthy of their reception.He died, however, before the work was commenced, but left a large sum of
money for the purpose.This church was built on the old site situated
between the Ducal Palace and the church of St.Theodore, which, up to
that time, had served as the Ducal chapel.The width of the church would
seem to have been the same as that of the present nave and aisles.Its
west end formed part of the existing wall behind the present vestibule,
but some difference of opinion seems to exist as to its eastern end, and
whether it coincided with the actual apses.Though nominally built in
976-78 the decoration of Orseolo’s church was probably carried on in
succeeding years, and much of the sculptural work in the present
building dates from the first half of the 11th century.In 1063, under
the Doge Domenico Contarini, the church of St.Theodore, according to M.
Cattaneo,[277] was pulled down and some of its materials used in the new
cathedral.Portions also of the Ducal Palace were destroyed to give
increased space on the south side for the Transept, the portion known as
the Treasury only being preserved.[278] The record of the new church
states that it was built similar in its artistic construction to that at
Constantinople erected in honour of the twelve apostles.[279] The
arrangement and the design of the church thus extended were probably due
to a Greek architect, though much of the work, according to M. Cattaneo,
was afterwards carried out by a Lombard sculptor, Mazulo, who designed
the atrium and tower of the abbey of Pomposa (about 30 miles from
Venice), where the carving is of the same character or style as that in
St.across the transepts; externally these dimensions are increased
to 260 × 215, and the whole area to about 46,000 square ft., so that
although of respectable dimensions it is by no means a large church.The
central and western dome are 42 ft.They are carried on spherical pendentives resting on circular
barrel vaults about 15 ft.extends under
the eastern dome and apses, the vault being supported by fifty-six
monolithic columns 5 ft.high: the whole height from floor to the
crown of the arch being under 9 ft.The construction of this crypt
probably followed the erection of the church, which was not consecrated
till 1111, when Ordelapo Faliero was Doge.Externally this apse is
polygonal, as in Byzantine churches, the upper storey being set back to
allow of a passage round.The narthex or vestibule in front of the
church, which extends also on north and south of the nave aisles up to
the transepts, and the rooms over the north narthex and over part of the
baptistery, must have followed the erection of the church; in fact, the
principal front could not have been completed without them.(From ‘Chiesi
Principali di Europa.’)]

Externally the original construction was in brick, with blind arcades,
niches, and a simple brick cornice such as is found in Lombardic work.It was not till the commencement of the 13th century that the decoration
of the front and sides with marble was undertaken; the arches were
encased with marble slabs carried on ranges of columns, those of the
narthex being placed one above the other.The shafts, capitals and bases
were brought from other buildings, having been imported from Altinum,
Aquileia, Heraclea, Ravenna, and from other places in Dalmatia, Syria,
and the East.It is possible that the porches of the churches of St.Trophime at Arles may have suggested this method of
decoration, of which no prototype exists in the East.The capitals are
of all periods, from the 4th to the 11th centuries, the entablature
blocks and the stylobates being specially worked for the building.The
rose window of the south transept and others of similar style were
inserted about the commencement of the 14th century, the baptistery and
the chapel of St.Isidore[280] being encased with marbles in the middle
of the same century, and the decoration of the upper part of the arches
of the west, towards the end of the 14th century.As will be seen by the
north and south fronts section (Woodcut No.416) the original brick
domes were surmounted by timber domes covered with lead, and of
considerable height.These were probably added in the middle of the 13th
century.[281] The rood loft dates from the end of the same century.The
earlier mosaics in the domes date from the 12th century, and the marble
casing of the lower portion of the walls and the richly decorated
pavement from the 12th and 13th centuries.The work of decoration was
carried on through succeeding centuries with occasional restorations, so
that the church itself constitutes a museum with almost every phase of
work in mosaic from the 12th to the 18th centuries.Though from a strictly architectural point of view the disposition of
the design is not equal to those of some of our northern cathedrals
(except perhaps for the greater beauty of Byzantine domical
construction), it is impossible to find fault with plain surfaces when
they are covered with such exquisite gold mosaics as those of St.Mark’s, or with the want of accentuation in the lines of the roof, when
every part of it is more richly adorned in this manner than any other
church of the Western world.Then too the rood screens, the pulpit, the
pala d’oro and the whole furniture of the choir are so rich, so
venerable, and on the whole so beautiful, and seen in so exquisitely
subdued a light, that it is impossible to deny that it is perhaps the
most impressive interior in Western Europe.Front at Périgueux, with
almost identical dimensions and design (Woodcut No.562), is cold,
scattered, and unmeaning, because but a structural skeleton of St.Mark’s without its adornments.The interior of a 13th-century Gothic
church is beautiful, even when whitewashed; but these early attempts had
not yet reached that balance between construction and ornament, which is
necessary to real architectural effect.The same is true of the exterior; if stripped of its ornament and
erected in plain stone it would hardly be tolerable, and the mixture of
florid 14th-century foliage and bad Italian Gothic details with the
older work, would be all but unendurable.But marble, mosaic, sculpture,
and the all-hallowing touch of age and association, disarm the critic,
and force him to worship when his reason tells him he ought to blame.Mark’s must have been admired in the days of its freshness,
the Gothic feeling seems to have been so strong in Northern Italy in the
11th and 12th centuries as to prevent its being used as a model.The one
prominent exception is San Antonio, Padua (1237-1307), which is
evidently a copy of St.Mark’s, but with so much Gothic design mixed up
with it as to spoil both.Length was sought to be obtained by using
seven domes instead of five, and running an aisle round the apse.The
side-aisles were covered with intersecting vaults, and pointed arches
were occasionally introduced when circular would have harmonised better
with the general design.Externally the enveloping porch was omitted—not even the Pisan
modification of it introduced, though it might have been employed with
the happiest effect.The consequence of all this jumble is, that San
Antonio is externally one of the most unsatisfactory churches in Europe,
though possessing a quaint Oriental look from the grouping of its dome
with the minaret-like spires which adorn it.The inside is not so bad,
though a roof of only five bays over a quasi-Gothic church, 200 ft.in
length, distorts the proportion, and with the ill-understood details of
the whole, spoils what narrowly escaped being one of the most successful
interiors of that part of Italy.Both Dalmatia and Istria formed part of the Gothic kingdom of Theodoric:
we find therefore the same Byzantine influence exerted as in Ravenna; an
influence which increased when the first-named country was retaken by
Justinian in 535, and the second in 539 A.D.At Parenzo in Istria there is a basilica, built in the year 543 A.D.by
the Bishop Euphrasius, and consequently contemporary with the examples
at Ravenna already described.This church still retains its atrium,
baptistery, and other accompaniments, which those at Ravenna have lost.It consists of a basilica in three aisles, with an apse at the end of
each, and an atrium in front, beyond which is situated the baptistery;
and in front of this again a tower, though this latter feature seems to
be of more modern date.On one side at the east end is a chapel or
crypt; this, Mr.Jackson[282] suggests, may have been “the martyrium or
confessio of the basilica where the remains of the saintly patrons of
the church were preserved and venerated.” “According to strict rule,”
Mr.Jackson observes, “the confessio should be in a crypt under the
choir as at Aquileja and Zara, but Parenzo lies so low that excavation
would be difficult, and here as in other cases the martyrium may have
been placed in an adjoining building.”[283]

Internally the church is 121 ft.in length by 32 in width, and possesses
all the usual arrangements of a church of that date.The columns are
borrowed from some earlier edifice, but the capitals are all original,
and were carved for the church.They are all of pure Byzantine type, and
are surmounted by that essentially Byzantine feature the dosseret.The
central apse, though circular inside, is polygonal outside, which is
another characteristic of Byzantine work.Like Torcello it has still
preserved its semicircle of marble seats for the clergy, with the
episcopal throne in the middle.Externally the façade retains portions
of the ancient mosaics with which it was decorated, and although
internally the nave has lost its early decorations, the lofty dado of
the apse inlaid with slabs of porphyry and serpentine interspersed with
mosaics of opaque glass, onyx and mother-of-pearl, bears witness to its
original splendour, the cypher of Euphrasius denoting its execution to
be coeval with the building of the church, and therefore some centuries
earlier than the mosaics of the baldachino, which are dated 1277.Church at Parenzo in Istria.Jackson for the description of two churches
at Grado: the Duomo and St.Maria delle Grazie; the former a fine
basilican church with nave and aisles and a deep central apse, circular
inside and polygonal externally.[284] The twenty columns of the nave are
all taken from earlier edifices, and of the capitals which surmount them
five are Roman and twelve of pure Byzantine workmanship, based on the
Roman composite capital, but treated in a quite original way.The
capitals are not surmounted by the dosseret, but in the other church of
St.Maria delle Grazie some have the dosseret and others are without it,
though all of the same period.The chief glory of the church, however,
lies in its magnificent marble pavement (measured and illustrated in Mr.Jackson’s work), the greater portion of which is still preserved.Maria delle Grazie is a small basilican church of six bays
with fragments of similar pavement to those in the Duomo.The apse here
is masked on the exterior by two sacristies on each side which entirely
enclose it; similar examples are found in De Vogüé’s work of “Central
Syria” (Woodcuts Nos.The churches of Parenzo and Grado appear to be the only examples
remaining of early Romano-Byzantine work on this side of the Adriatic.Maria de Canneto at Pola, consecrated in 546 A.D., was destroyed in
the 14th and 15th centuries and its materials carried off to Venice for
the adornment of the churches there.As edifices of the age of
Justinian, and as showing the relative position of the various parts
that made up an ecclesiastical establishment in those early times, the
churches of Parenzo and Grado are singularly deserving of the attention
of those to whom the history of art is a matter of interest.The church at Torcello, in the Venetian Lagune, is the last example it
will be necessary to quote in order to make the arrangements of the
early basilicas intelligible.It was originally erected in the seventh
century; of this church, according to M. Cattaneo, the only portion
remaining, if we except a fragment of the ancient baptistery, is the
central apse.In 864, the church would seem to have been reconstructed,
and to this period belong the two side apses, the apsidal crypt with new
windows pierced through the old wall and the external walls: it is
possible that the original nave of the seventh century was retained till
1008, when it was rebuilt by the Doge Pietro Orseolo, on the occasion of
his son being raised to the Bishopric of Torcello.Thirteen of the
capitals of the nave date from this period, one may be earlier, and five
belong to the second half of the 12th century.The whole width of the
church is 71 ft.A screen of six pillars
divides the nave from the sanctuary.Perhaps, however, the most
interesting part of this church is the interior of its apse, which still
retains the bishop’s throne, surrounded by six ranges of seats for his
presbytery, arranged like those of an ancient theatre.It presents one
of the most extensive and best preserved examples of the fittings of the
apse, and gives a better idea of the mode in which the apses of churches
were originally arranged than anything that is to be found in any other
church, either of its age or of an earlier period.404), this church possesses a small
side chapel, a vestry or sanctuary, on the Gospel side of the altar, and
the remains of the ancient baptistery may still be traced in front of
the west door.This was a square block, externally, measuring 37 ft.each way; internally an octagon, with the angles cut into hemispherical
niches.A portion of its eastern side only remains, and this is now
hidden behind the modern baptistery, in which, under a board in the
pavement, can be seen the foundations of the second baptistery of the
12th century.In the rear of the church stood the campanile, and across
a narrow passage the conventual buildings; in front of which now stands
the beautiful little church of Sta.Fosca, the whole making up a group
of nearly unrivalled interest considering its small dimensions.Other examples might be quoted differing in some slight respect from
those just given, but the above are probably sufficient to explain the
general arrangements of the early basilican churches and the style of
their architecture, so long as this worked on the old tradition of the
Romano-Byzantine style; in other words, so long as it continued in Italy
to be a distinction from the Roman style without any foreign admixture
beyond that introduced direct from Byzantium.It might be instructive to
speculate on what the style might have become if left alone to develope
itself on its native soil, but it would be extremely difficult to make
the subject clear without a much larger amount of illustration than is
admissible, and which in such a history as this would be out of place.Simultaneously with the elaboration of the rectangular form of church by
the Italians, the Byzantines were occupied with the same task; but,
being freer from the trammels of tradition and less influenced by
examples, they early arrived at forms much more divergent from those of
the classical period than those of Italy, and their style, reacting on
the Italian, produced that very beautiful combination of which Pisa
Cathedral is a type, and St.Mark’s at Venice an extreme example.This
style generally pervaded the whole south of Italy, with the exception of
Rome; and, from the elements of which it was composed, may fairly be
designated Byzantine Italian.Apse of Basilica at Torcello.]While this was going on in the south, the Longobards, and other
Barbarians who invaded the north of Italy, seized on this type and
worked it out in their own fashion.They, however, conceived the desire
to give a more permanent character to their churches by covering them
over with stone vaulted roofs, which led to most important modifications
of the style.It may probably be correct to assert that no
Romano-Byzantine or early Romanesque church has, or ever had, a vaulted
nave.On the other hand, there is hardly a Barbarian church which the
builders did not aspire to vault, though they were frequently unable to
accomplish it.It was this vaulting mania which led to the invention of
compound piers, pointed arches, buttresses, pinnacles, and all the
numerous peculiarities of the Gothic style; and which, reacting on
northern Italy, produced the Ghibelline or Italian-Gothic style.No exact boundary can be drawn between these two: modifications of style
varied, as Byzantine or Gothic influences ebbed or flowed, during the
Middle Ages.Venice and Pisa, and all Calabria, were generally
influenced by their intercourse with the East, while the whole of the
north of Italy and away from the coast as far down as Sienna and Orvieto
the strong hand of the Teuton made itself felt.Yet Italy cannot be said to have been successful in either style.Her
superior civilisation enabled her to introduce and use an elegance of
detail unknown north of the Alps; but she did not work out the basilican
type for herself: she left it to others to do that for her, and
consequently never perfectly understood what she undertook, or why it
was done.The result is that, though great elegance is found in parts,
Italy can hardly produce a single church which is satisfactory as a
design; or which would be intelligible without first explaining the
basework of those true styles from which its principal features have
been borrowed.Costanza—Churches at Perugia, Nocera,
  Ravenna, Milan—Secular Buildings.In addition to the Pagan basilicas and temples, from which the
arrangements of so many of the Christian edifices were obtained, the
tombs of the Romans formed a third type, from which the forms of a very
important class of churches were derived.The form which these buildings retained, so long as they remained mere
sepulchres appropriated to Pagan uses, has been already described (pp.That of Cæcilia Metella and those of Augustus and Hadrian
were what would now be called “chambered tumuli;” originally the
sepulchral chamber was infinitesimally small as compared with the mass,
but we find these being gradually enlarged till we approach the age of
Constantine, when, as in the tombs of the Tossia Family, that called the
Tomb of Helena (Woodcut No.227) and many others of the same age, they
became miniature Pantheons.The central apartment was all in all; the
exterior was not thought of.Still they were appropriated to sepulchral
rites, and these only, so long as they belonged to Pagan Rome.The case
was different when they were erected by the Christians.No association
could be more appropriate than that of these sepulchral edifices, to a
religion nursed in persecution, and the apostles of which had sealed
their faith with their blood as martyrs; and when the Sacrament for the
dying and the burial service were employed, it was in these circular
churches that it was performed.But besides the viaticum for the
departing Christian, the Church provided the admission sacrament of
baptism for those who were entering into communion, and this was, in
early days at least, always performed in a building separate from the
basilica.It would depend on whether marriage was then considered as a
sacrament or a civil contract, whether it was celebrated in the basilica
or the church; but it seems certain that the one was used almost
exclusively as the business place of the community, the other as the
sacramental temple of the sect.This appears always to have been the
case, at least when the two forms existed together, as they almost
always did in the great ecclesiastical establishments of Italy.When the
church was copied from a temple, as in the African examples above
described, it is probable it may have served both purposes.But too
little is known of the architecture of this early age, and its
liturgies, to speak positively on the subject.The uses and derivation of these three forms of churches are so distinct
that it would be extremely convenient if we could appropriate names to
distinguish them.The first retains most appropriately the name of
basilica, and with sufficient limitation to make it generally
applicable.The word _ecclesia_, or _église_, would equally suffice for
the second but that it is not English, and has been so indiscriminately
applied that it could not now be used in a restricted sense.The word
kirk, or as we soften it into church, would be appropriate to the
third,[286] but again it has been so employed as to be inapplicable.We
therefore content ourselves with employing the words Basilica, Church,
and Round Church, to designate the three, employing some expletive when
any confusion is likely to arise between the first two of the series.The most interesting feature of the early Romanesque circular buildings
is that they show the same transitional progress from an external to an
internal columnar style of architecture which marked the change from the
Pagan to the Christian form of sacred edifice.It is perhaps not too
much to assert that no ancient classic building of circular form has any
pillars used constructively in its interior.[287] Even the Pantheon,
though 143 ft.in diameter, derives no assistance from the pillars
that surround it internally—they are mere decorative features.The same
is true of the last Pagan example we are acquainted with—the temple or
tomb which Diocletian erected in his palace at Spalato (Woodcut No.The pillars do fill up the angles there, but the building would be
stable without them.The Byzantine architects also generally declined to
avail themselves of pillars to support their domes, but the Romanesque
architects used them almost as universally as in their basilicas.Another very striking peculiarity is the entire abandonment of all
external decoration.Roman circular temples had peristyles, like those
at Tivoli (Woodcut No.193) and that of Vesta in Rome.Even the Pantheon
is as remarkable for its portico as its dome, so is that known as the
Torre dei Schiavi,[288] but it is only in the very earliest of the
Christian edifices that we find a trace of the portico, and even in them
hardly any attempt at external decoration.The temples of the Christians
were no longer shrines to contain statues and to which worship might be
addressed by people outside, but had become halls to contain the
worshippers themselves while engaged in acts of devotion.The tomb of the Empress Helena (Woodcut No.227) is one of the earliest
examples of its class.It has no pillars internally, it is true, but it
likewise has none on the exterior—the transition was not then complete.The same is the case with the two tombs on the Spina of the Circus of
Nero (Woodcut No.They too were astylar, and their external
appearance was utterly neglected.When from these we turn to the Tomb or Baptistery of Constantine, built
some time afterwards (Woodcut No.422), we find the roof supported by a
screen of eight columns, two storeys in height, and through all its
alterations can detect the effort to make the interior ornamental.It
has, however, a portico, but this again is practically an interior, both
ends being closed with apsidal terminations, so that it really forms a
second apartment, rather than a portico.In both these respects it is in
advance of the building next to it in age that we know of—the Octagon at
Spalato—which it otherwise very much resembles.The eight internal
pillars instead of being mere ornaments have become essential parts of
the construction, and the external peristyle has disappeared, leaving
only the fragment of a porch.(From
Isabelle, ‘Édifices Circulaires.’) Scale 100 ft.The tomb which the same Emperor erected to contain the remains of his
daughter Constantia, is another example of the same transitional style.The interior in this instance is vaulted, but so timidly that
twenty-four pillars are employed to sustain a weight for which half that
number would have been amply sufficient.In the square niche opposite
the entrance stood the sarcophagus of the princess, now in the Vatican.The roof of the aisle is adorned with paintings of the vintage and
scenes of rural life, which, like all those on the tombs of Pagan Rome,
have no reference to the sepulchral uses to which the building was
dedicated.The whole internal diameter of the tomb is 73 ft., that of
the dome 35.In front of the building is a small crypto-porticus similar in
arrangement to that of her father’s tomb, and beyond this is an oblong
space with circular ends, and surrounded on all sides by arcades; its
dimensions were 535 ft.by 130, and, though so ruined as hardly to allow
of its arrangements being restored, it is interesting as being perhaps
the only instance of the “_forum_,” which it is probable was left before
all tombs in those times, and traces of which may perhaps be found
elsewhere, though as yet they have not been looked for.(From Gutensohn and
Knapp.)The only other important circular building within the walls of Rome of
this early age is that known as S. Stefano Rotondo.Though there is
nothing to fix its date with any precision, it is almost certain that it
belongs to the fifth century of the Christian era.in
diameter, and its roof was supported by two ranges of columns,
circularly disposed in its interior; and on the first or inner range
rested a horizontal architrave like that of St.In the outer
one the pillars support arches like those of St.[290] All the
pillars are taken from older buildings.The outer aisle was divided into
eight compartments; but in what manner, and for what purpose, it is not
now easy to ascertain, owing to the ruined state of the building, and to
its having been so much and so frequently altered since it was first
erected.Nor can it be determined exactly how it was roofed; though it
is probable that its arrangements were identical with those of the great
five-aisled basilicas, which it closely resembles, except in its
circular shape.This is more clear in another church of the same age, that of Sti.Angeli, at Perugia, which is very similar in its disposition.Of this
building a section is here shown, as given by M. Isabelle—perhaps not
quite to be depended upon in every respect, but still affording a very
fair representation of what the arrangements of the circular wooden
roofed churches were.Its dimensions are much less than those of San
Stefano, being only 115 ft.in diameter; but it is more regular, the
greater part of its materials being apparently original, and made for
the place they occupy.In the church of San Stefano, the tomb-shaped
circular form was probably used as symbolical of his martyrdom.That at
Perugia was most likely originally a baptistery, or it may also have
been dedicated to some martyr; but in the heart of Etruria this form may
have been adopted for other reasons, the force of which we are hardly
able at the present day to appreciate, though in all cases locality is
one of the strongest influencing powers in so far as architectural forms
are concerned.(From Isabelle,
‘Édifices Circulaires.’) No scale.]Plan of Baptistery at Nocera dei Pagani.Double the
usual scale, or 50 ft.At Nocera dei Pagani, on the road between Naples and Salerno, there is
an extremely beautiful circular church, built undoubtedly for the
purpose of a baptistery, and very similar in plan and general
arrangement to the tomb of Constantia, now known as the Baptistery of
Sta.Agnese, though somewhat larger being 80 ft.Its
principal merit is the form of its dome, which is not only correct in a
scientific point of view, but singularly graceful internally.Externally
this building for the first time introduces us to a peculiarity which
had as much influence on the western styles as any of those pointed out
above.540), the early Romanesque architects
never attempted to vault their rectangular buildings, but they did
frequently construct domes over their circular edifices.But here again
they did not make the outside of the dome the outline of their
buildings, as the Romans had always done before the time of Constantine,
and as the Byzantines and Saracens invariably did afterwards; but they
employed their vault only as a ceiling internally, and covered it, as in
this instance, with a false wooden roof externally.It may be difficult
to determine how far this was a judicious innovation; but this at least
is certain, that it had as much influence on the development of the
Gothic style as the vaulting mania itself.In the 10th and 11th
centuries many attempts were made to construct true roofs of stone, but
unsuccessfully; and from various causes, which will be pointed out
hereafter, the idea was abandoned, and the architects were forced to
content themselves with a stone ceiling, covered by a wooden roof,
though this became one of the radical defects of the style, and one of
the principal causes of the decay and destruction of so many beautiful
buildings.Section of Baptistery at Nocera dei Pagani.(From
Isabelle, ‘Édifices Circulaires.’) No scale.]Ravenna possesses several circular buildings, almost as interesting as
those of the capital; the first being the baptistery of St.John
belonging to the original basilica, and consequently one of the oldest
Christian buildings of the place.Externally it is a plain octagonal
building, 40 ft.Internally it still retains its mosaic and
other internal features added in the 5th century, which are singularly
elegant and pleasing.Its design is somewhat like that of the temple at
Spalato, but with arcades substituted everywhere for horizontal
architraves; the century that elapsed between these two epochs having
sufficed to complete the transition between the two styles.Far more interesting than this is the great church of St.Vitale, the
most complicated, and at the same time, perhaps, the most beautiful, of
the circular churches of that age.In design it is nearly identical with
the church of St.Sergius at Constantinople (see Woodcut No.311), from
which it was undoubtedly copied, and probably by Greek artists from that
town.It was built in the reign of Justinian by St.Ecclesius,
archbishop of the see, and was consecrated in 547, eight years after the
taking of Ravenna by Justinian’s generals.The principal difference of
the plan lies in its being enclosed within an octagon instead of a
square, as in St.Sergius, probably to mask the irregularity of the main
entrance from a street which did not run in the direction of any of the
cardinal points.The recesses are loftier in proportion than those of
St.Sergius, and in the lower storey arcades take the place of beams.The aisles being covered with timber roofs, it was necessary to raise
the walls of the octagon higher than those of St.Sergius, and small
arches take the place of the usual pendentives: the springing of the
dome, which is 50 ft.in diameter, is on the level of the sill of the
windows the arches of which therefore form penetrations into the dome.The church is built in bricks with thick mortar joints, the dome being
constructed in an ingenious manner with hollow pots fitted the end of
one into the mouth of the other; the lightness of this vault has enabled
the builders to dispense with the immense arches and buttresses found in
St.Similar construction with pots had been
employed in the East for domes and roofs,[291] and they form as
permanent a method as stone itself, in addition to the stability,
facility of construction, and lightness which such an expedient affords.Internally a good deal has been done in modern times to destroy the
simplicity of the original effect of the building; but still there is a
pleasing result produced by alternating the piers with circular columns,
and a lightness and elegance about the whole design that render it
unrivalled in the western world among churches of its class.This seems
to have been admitted by its contemporaries as much as it is in modern
times.Charlemagne at all events copied it for his own tomb at
Aix-la-Chapelle, and the architects of many other circular buildings of
that age appear to have derived their inspiration from this one.The church of San Lorenzo at Milan, had it not been so much altered in
modern times, would take precedence of San Vitale in almost every
respect.The date of its erection is not known, though it certainly must
be as early as, if not earlier than, the time of Justinian.Down to the
8th century it was the cathedral of the city.It was burnt to the ground
in 1071, and restored in 1119; the dome then erected fell in 1571, on
which it underwent its last transformation from the hands of Martino
Bassi and Pellegrini, who so disfigured its ancient details as to lead
many modern inquirers to doubt whether it was really so old as it was
said to be.Its plan, however, seems to have remained unchanged, and shows a further
progress towards what afterwards became the Byzantine style than is to
be found either in St.It is in fact the
earliest attempt to amalgamate the circular church with one of a square
shape; and except that the four lateral colonnades are flat segments of
circles, and that there is a little clumsiness in the angles (due
possibly to the additions made in 1119 and 1571, when the plan of the
dome was changed to an octagon, the original dome being probably
circular, and carried on four spherical pendentives), it is one of the
most successful designs handed down from that early age.The dome as it now stands is octagonal, which the first dome certainly
could not have been.Its diameter is 70 ft., nearly equal to that of the
Minerva Medica, and the whole diameter of the building is internally 142
ft.(From Quast,
‘Altchristlichen,’ &c.)In front of the church, in the street, is a handsome colonnade of
pillars, borrowed from some ancient temple—it is said from one dedicated
to Hercules; this leads to a square atrium, now wholly deprived of its
lateral arcades; and this again to a façade, which has been strangely
altered in modern times.Opposite this, to the eastward of the church,
is an octagonal building, apparently intended as a tomb-house; and on
the north side a similar one, though smaller.Mary travelled to the bedroom.On the south is the
baptistery, about 45 ft.in diameter, approached by a vestibule in the
same manner as that of Constantine at Rome, and as in the tomb of his
daughter Constantia: all these, however, have been so painfully altered,
that little remains besides the bare plan of the building; still there
is enough to show that this is one of the oldest and most interesting of
the Christian churches of Italy.The building now known as the baptistery at Florence is an octagon, 108
ft.Like the last-mentioned church, it was
originally the cathedral of the city, and was erected to serve as such
apparently in the time of Theodelinda, queen of the Lombards.If this
was so, it certainly had not originally its present form, and most
probably those columns which now stand ranged round the walls at that
time stood in the centre, as in the Roman examples.If the original roof
was of wood, it was probably in two storeys, like that of the baptistery
of Constantine, or it may have been a dome of more solid materials, like
that of the Sta.At the same time when the new cathedral was built, the older edifice
appears to have been remodelled both internally and externally by
Arnolpho da Lapo, and both its form and decoration so completely
changed, that it must now be considered rather as a building of the 13th
century than of the 6th, in which it seems originally to have been
erected.[292]

[Illustration: 433.Half Section, half Elevation, of the Baptistery at
Novara.The baptistery of Novara, which may date from the time of Charlemagne,
is interesting in that it contains the germ of those external galleries
under the roof which form not only one of the most common but also one
of the most beautiful features of the later Lombard and Rhenish
churches.433) it will easily be seen
what was the motive and use of this arrangement, the first trace of
which dates perhaps as far back as the baptistery of Nocera (Woodcut No.428); for wherever a wooden roof was placed over a circular vault, it is
evident that the external walls must be carried up higher than the
springing of the arch.But it was by no means necessary that this
additional wall should be so solid as that below it, and it was
necessary to introduce light and air into the space between the stone
and the wooden roofs.Add to this the incongruity of effect in placing a
light tiled wooden roof on a massive solid wall, and it will be evident
that not only did the exigencies of the building, but the true
principles of taste, demand that this part should be made as light as
possible.Such openings as those found in the baptistery at Novara
suggested an expedient which provided for these objects.This was
afterwards carried to a much greater extent.At first, however, it seems
only to have been used under the roofs of the domes with which the
Italians almost universally crowned the intervention of naves and
transepts, and round the semidomes of the apses; but so enamoured did
they afterwards become of this feature, that it is frequently carried
along the sides of the churches under the roof of the nave and of the
aisles, and also—where it is of more questionable taste—under the
sloping naves of the roof of the principal façade.There is nothing in the Lombardian and Rhenish styles so common or so
beautiful as these galleries, the arcades of which have all the shadow
given by a cornice without its inconvenient projection, while the little
shafts with their elegant capitals and light archivolts have a sparkle
and brilliancy which no cornice ever possessed.Indeed so beautiful are
they, that we are not surprised to find them universally adopted; and
their discontinuance on the introduction of the pointed style was one of
the greatest losses sustained by architectural art in those days.It is
true they would have been quite incompatible with the thin walls and
light piers of pointed architecture, but it may be safely asserted that
no feature which these new styles introduced was equally beautiful with
those galleries which they superseded.Tomb of Galla Placidia, Ravenna.There can be little doubt that many other similar buildings belonging to
this age still exist in various parts of Italy; for it is more than
probable that, at a time when the city was not of sufficient importance,
or the congregation so numerous as to require the more extended
accommodation of the basilica, almost all the earlier churches were
circular.They either, however, have perished from lapse of time, or
have been so altered as to be nearly unrecognisable.We here, in
consequence, come again to a break in the chain of our sequence; and
when we again meet with any circular buildings in Italy, their features
are so distinctly Gothic or Byzantine, that they must be classed with
one or other of these modifications.The true Romano-Byzantine style had
nearly come to an end when Alboin the Lombard had made himself master of
the greater part of Italy about the year 575.Before leaving this branch of the subject there are two small buildings
at Ravenna which it is impossible to pass over, though their direct
bearing on the history of this subject is not so apparent as it is in
the case of other buildings just described.The first and earliest is
the tomb of Galla Placidia (Woodcut No.302), now known as the church of
SS.Nazario and Celso, and must have been erected before the year 450.It is singular among all the tombs of that age from the abandonment in
it of the circular for a cruciform plan.Such forms, it is true, are
common in the chambers of tumuli and also among the catacombs, while the
church which Constantine built in Constantinople and dedicated to the
Apostles, meaning it however as a sepulchral church, was something also
on this plan.Notwithstanding, however, these examples, this must be
considered as an exceptional form, though its diminutiveness (it being
only 35 ft.by 30 internally) might perhaps account for any caprice.Its
great interest to us consists in its retaining not only its primitive
architectural form (which is that of a dome carried on pendentives, and
one of the few instances in which both dome and pendentives form part of
one sphere), but its polychromatic decorations nearly in their original
state of completeness (Woodcut 302).The three arms of the cross forming
the receptacles for the three sarcophagi is certainly a pleasing
arrangement, but is only practicable on a small scale.Capital of Pillars forming peristyle round
Theodoric’s Tomb.Elevation of Tomb of Theodoric, Ravenna.(From
Isabelle, ‘Édifices Circulaires.’)]

Far more interesting than this—architecturally at least—is the tomb of
Theodoric, the Gothic king, now known as Santa Maria Rotunda.The lower
storey is a decagon externally, enclosing a cruciform crypt.in diameter, each face being ornamented by a deep niche.These
support a flat terrace, on which originally stood a range of small
pillars supporting arches which surrounded the upper storey.These have
all been removed, though their form can be restored from fragments
found, and as shown in Woodcut No.On the face of the tomb itself
are the sinkings for the architraves and vaults which they supported.The most singular part of the building is the roof, which is formed of
one great slab hollowed out into the form of a flat dome—internally 30
ft.in diameter—and which certainly forms one of
the most unique and appropriate coverings for a tomb perhaps anywhere to
be found.Near the edge are a series of projecting bosses, which
evidently were originally used as handles, by means of which the immense
mass was raised to its present position.In the centre of the dome is a
small square pedestal, on which, it is said, once stood the urn which
contained the ashes of its founder.The model of this building seems probably to have been the Mole of
Hadrian, which Theodoric saw, and must have admired, during his
celebrated visit to Rome.The polygonal arrangements of the exterior,
and the substitution of arcades for horizontal architraves, were only
such changes as the lapse of time had rendered indispensable.But the
building of the ancient world which it most resembles is the Tour Magne
at Nîmes.In both cases we have the polygonal basement containing a
great chamber, and above this externally the narrow ledge, approached by
flying flights of steps.We cannot now tell what crowned the French
example, though the fact of an urn crowning the tomb at Ravenna points
to an identical origin, but we must obtain a greater number of examples
before we can draw any positive conclusions as to the origin of such
forms.Meanwhile, however, whether we consider the appropriateness of
the forms, the solidity of its construction, or the simplicity of its
ornaments and details, this tomb at Ravenna is not surpassed by any
building of its class and age.Though the investigation of the early history of these circular forms of
churches is not so important as that of the rectangular basilicas, it is
extremely interesting from the influence they had on the subsequent
development of the style.In Italy it is probable that one-half of the
early churches were circular in plan; and one such is still generally
retained attached to each cathedral as a baptistery.Except for this
purpose, however, the form has generally been superseded: the
rectangular being much easier to construct, more capable of extension,
and altogether more appropriate to the ritual of the Christian
community.In France the circular form was early absorbed into the
basilica, forming the Chevet or apse.In Germany its fate was much the
same as in Italy, but its supersession was earlier and more complete.In
England some half-dozen examples are known to exist, and in Spain they
have yet to be discovered.Had the Gothic architects applied themselves to the extension and
elaboration of the circular form with the same zeal and skill as was
displayed in that task by their Byzantine brethren, they might probably
have produced something far more beautiful than even the best of our
mediæval cathedrals; but when the Barbarians began to build, they found
the square form with its straight lines simpler and easier to construct.It thus happened that, long before they became as civilised and expert
as the Easterns were when they commenced the task, the Westerns had
worked the rectangular form into one of considerable beauty, and had
adapted it to their ritual, and their ritual to it.It thus became the
sacred and appropriate form, and the circular or domical forms were
consequently never allowed a fair trial in Western Europe.Very few remains of secular buildings in the early Christian style are
now to be found in Italy.The palace of Theodoric at Ravenna, though
sadly mutilated, is perhaps the best and most perfect.In all its
details it shows a close resemblance to that of Diocletian at Spalato,
but more especially so to the Porta Aurea and the most richly and least
classically decorated parts of that edifice, but much intermixed with
mouldings and details which would seem to belong to a later style.Another building, though perhaps of earlier date, is that which is now
called the Palazzo delle Torre at Turin, and which still retains the
architectural ordinance of the exterior of a Roman amphitheatre, but so
modified by common sense that the pilasters are frankly accepted as
purely decorative features, having only a slight projection.A similar
style of work is found at Bordeaux in what is known as the “Palais
Gallien,” but which in reality is a fragment of an amphitheatre built by
the Emperor Gallienus (260-268 A.D.).The example at Turin is built with
brick of large dimensions 15 in.by 11 in., which, coupled with its
character and style, has led M. Cattaneo to ascribe it to the 3rd or 4th
century of our era; the paucity of contemporary examples, however,
renders it extremely difficult to trace the exact history of the style
at this age.Palazzo delle Torre, Turin.(From Osten’s ‘Bauwerke
in der Lombardei.’)]

In so progressive an art as architecture it is always very difficult,
sometimes impossible, to fix the exact date when one style ends and
another begins.In an art so pre-eminently ecclesiastical as
architecture was in those days, it will probably be safer to look in the
annals of the Church rather than in those of the State for a date when
the debased-Roman expired, giving birth, phœnix-like, to the Romanesque.Viewed from this point there can be little doubt but that the reign of
Gregory the Great (A.D.590 to 603) must be regarded as that in which
the Latin language and the Roman style of architecture both ceased to be
generally or even commonly employed.After this date we wander on through five centuries of tentative efforts
to form a new style, and in the age of another Gregory—the VII.—we find
at last the Romanesque style emancipated from former traditions, and
marching steadily forward with a well-defined aim.What had been
commenced under the gentle influence of a Theodelinda at Florence in the
year 600, was completed in the year 1077 under the firmer guidance of a
Matilda at Canossa.LOMBARD AND ROUND-ARCHED GOTHIC.Chapel at Friuli—Churches at Piacenza and Novara—St.Ambrogio, Milan—Cathedral, Piacenza—Churches at Verona—Churches at
  Toscanella—Circular Churches—Towers.When, in the early centuries of the Christian era, the great mass of
Gothic barbarism moved up the Valley of the Danube towards the west, one
great division followed that river to its source, and thence penetrated
into and settled in the Valley of the Rhine.Though sufficiently
numerous to be able almost wholly to obliterate all traces of former
civilisation, they had virtually no style of their own, and it seems
probable that the edifices left by the Romans sufficed for the early
wants of the people.The other great division of the horde turned to the Sömmering Alps and,
penetrating into Italy by way of Udine and Conegliano, settled in the
Valley of the Po.They may have been as numerous as the others; but
Italy in those days was far more densely peopled than Germany, and the
inhabitants were consequently able to resist obliteration far more
successfully than on the north of the Alps, and even where the new
element prevailed most strongly its influence was far less felt than in
the more sparsely-peopled Rhenish provinces.This was generally more
apparent along the coast than in the interior.Venice did not exist, and
Ravenna, though overwhelmed, became the great centre of Romano-Byzantine
art.The
Barbarian influence was strongly felt at Siena, more feebly at Orvieto;
but there it was stopped by the influence of Rome, which throughout the
Middle Ages remained nearly uncontaminated.Notwithstanding the almost insuperable barrier of the Alps which
stretched between them and the different influences to which they were
subjected, the connection between the northern and southern hordes
remained intimate during the whole of the Middle Ages.Milan was as much
German as Italian; and, indeed, except from a slightly superior degree
of elegance in the southern examples, it is sometimes extremely
difficult to distinguish between the designs of Lombard and of Rhenish
churches.As the Middle Ages wore on, however, the breach between the
two styles widened; and there is no difficulty, in the later pointed
schools, in seeing how Italy was gradually working itself free from
German influence, till at last they became distinct and antagonistic
nationalities, practising two styles of art, which had very little in
common the one with the other.Whoever the Barbarians were who in the 5th and 6th centuries swarmed
into Italy—Austro-Goths, Visi-Goths, or Lombards—they certainly did not
belong to any of the great building races of the world.Few people ever
had better opportunities than they of employing their easily-acquired
plunder in architectural magnificence, if they had any taste that way;
but, though we hear everywhere of the foundation of churches and the
endowment of ecclesiastical establishments during the Carlovingian
period, not one important edifice of that age has come down to our time.The monumental history of the early Romanesque style is as essentially a
blank in Italy as it is in Saxon England.One or two circular buildings
remain tolerably entire; some small chapels let us into the secrets of
the style, but not one important edifice of any sort attests the
splendour of the Lombard kingdom of Northern Italy.Aryans they must
have been, and it was not till the beginning of the 11th century, when
their blood was thoroughly mixed with that of the indigenous inhabitants
and a complete fusion of races had taken place, that we find buildings
of a monumental character erected, which have come down to the present
day.Among the smaller monuments of the age none has been preserved more
complete and less altered than the little chapel at Friuli; which,
though extremely small (only 18 ft.by 30 inside the walls), is
interesting, as retaining all its decorations almost exactly as they
were left by Gertrude, duchess of Friuli, who erected it in the 8th
century.It shows considerable elegance in its details, and the
sculpture is far better than it afterwards became, though perhaps its
most remarkable peculiarity is the intersecting vault that covers
it—_pulchre testudinatum_, as the old chronicle terms it.This is one
proof among many, how early that feature was introduced which afterwards
became the formative principle of the whole Gothic style, and was as
essentially its characteristic as the pillars and entablatures of the
five orders were the characteristics of the classical styles of Greece
and Rome.As before remarked, it is this necessity for a stone roof that
was the problem to be solved by the architects, and to accomplish which
the style took almost all those forms which are so much admired in it.From this example of the Carlovingian era we are obliged to pass to the
11th and 12th centuries, the first great building age of the Lombards.It is true that there is scarcely a single important church in Pavia, in
Verona, or indeed in any of the cities of Lombardy, the original
foundation of which cannot be traced back to a much earlier period.Before the canons of architectural criticism were properly understood,
antiquaries were inclined to believe that in the buildings now existing
they saw the identical edifices erected during the period of the Lombard
sway.Either, however, in consequence of the rude construction of the
earlier buildings, or because they were too small or too poor for the
increased population and wealth of the cities at a later period, every
one of the original churches has disappeared and been replaced by a
larger and better-constructed edifice, adorned with all the improvements
which the experience of centuries had introduced into the construction
of religious edifices.Judging from the rudeness of the earliest churches which we know to have
been erected in the 11th century, it is evident that the progress made,
up to that period, was by no means equal to what was accomplished during
the next two centuries.[294]]

This will appear from the plan and section of St.Antonio at Piacenza
(Woodcuts Nos.440 and 440a), built in the first years of the 11th
century, and dedicated in 1014 by Bishop Siegfried.Section of Church of San Antonio at Piacenza.Plan and section of Baptistry at Asti.Its arrangement is somewhat peculiar; the transepts are near the west
end, and the octagonal tower rising from the intersection is supported
on eight pillars, the square being completed by four polygonal piers.The principal point, however, to observe is, how completely the style
has emancipated itself from all Roman tradition.A new style has grown
up as essentially different from the early Christian as the style of
Cologne or of York Cathedral.The architect is once more at liberty to
work out his own designs without reference to anything beyond the
exigencies of the edifices themselves.The plan, indeed, is still a
reminiscence of the Basilica; but so are all the plans of Mediæval
cathedrals, and we may trace back the forms of the pillars, the piers,
and the arches they support, to the preceding style.All these were
derived from Roman art, but the originals are forgotten, and the new
style is wholly independent of the old one.The whole of the church too
is roofed with intersecting vaults, which have become an integral part
of the design, giving it an essentially different character.On the
outside buttresses are introduced—timidly, it is true, but so
frequently, as to make it evident that already there existed no
insuperable objection to increase either their number or depth, as soon
as additional abutment was required for wider arches.The windows, as in all Italian churches, are small, for the Italians
never patronised the art of painting on glass, always preferring
frescoes or paintings on opaque grounds.In their bright climate, very
small openings alone were requisite to admit a sufficiency of light
without disturbing that shadowy effect which is so favourable to
architectural grandeur.Being a parochial church, this building had no baptistery attached to
it; but there is one at Asti (Woodcut No.441) so similar in style and
age, that its plan and section, if examined with those of San Antonio,
will give a very complete idea of Lombard architecture in the beginning
of the 11th century, when it had completely shaken off the Roman
influence, but had not yet begun to combine the newly-invented forms
with that grace and beauty which mark its more finished examples.One
peculiarity of this building is the gloom that reigns within, there
being absolutely no windows in the dome, and those in the aisles are so
small, that even in Italy the interior must always have been in
comparative darkness.The cathedral of Novara, which in its present state is one of the most
important buildings of the 11th century in the North of Italy, shows the
style still further advanced.The coupling and grouping of piers are
here fully understood, and the divisions of the chapels which form the
outer aisle are, in fact, concealed buttresses.The Italians were never
able to divest themselves of their partiality for flat walls, and never
liked the bold external projections so universally admired on the other
side of the Alps.They therefore gladly had recourse to this expedient
to conceal them; and when this was not available they used metallic ties
to resist the thrust of the arches—an expedient which is found even in
this example.As will be seen from the annexed plan, the atrium
connecting the basilica with the baptistery is retained, which seems to
have been an arrangement almost universal in those early times.The half
section, half elevation of the front (Woodcut No.443) shows very
distinctly how far the invention of the new style had then gone; for
except some Corinthian pillars, borrowed from an older edifice, no trace
of debased-Roman architecture is to be found in it.The design of the
façade explains what it was that suggested to the Pisan architects the
form to which they adapted their Romanesque details.In both styles the
arcade was the original model of the whole system of ornamentation.In
this case it is used first as a discharging arch, then as a mere
repetition of a useful member, and lastly without pillars, as a mere
ornamental string-course, which afterwards became the most favourite
ornament, not only in Italy, but throughout all Germany.Elevation and Section of the Façade of the Cathedral
at Novara.Interesting as such an example is to the architectural antiquary who is
tracing back and trying to understand the forms of a new style, it would
be difficult to conceive anything much uglier and less artistic than
such a façade as this of Novara or that of San Antonio, last quoted.Their sole merit is their history and their expression of rude energy,
so characteristic of the people who erected them.The church of San Michele at Pavia, which took its present form either
at the end of the 11th or beginning of the 12th century, is one of the
most interesting of this age, and presents in itself all the
characteristics of a perfect round-arched Gothic church.Indeed there is
hardly any feature worth mentioning which was invented after this date
except the pointed arch—a very doubtful improvement—and window tracery,
which the Italians never cordially adopted or understood.444) shows the general arrangement of San Michele in its
present state.The researches of M. de Dartein,[295] however, have shown
that, when first built, the nave was covered over with two square
quadripartite vaults, as might in fact have been divined from the
difference in size[296] of the centre and two other piers.The existing
oblong vaulted compartments date from the 15th century, when secondary
shafts were carried up above the ground storey shafts of piers 1 and 3.The section, however, shows that well-marked vaulting shafts spring from
floor to roof, that the pier arches in the wall are probably distinct
and well understood, and that the angles of these piers are softened and
ornamented by shafts and other subordinate members.Altogether, it is
evident that that subdivision of labour (if the expression may be used)
which was so characteristic of the true Gothic style had here been
perfectly understood, every part having its own function and telling its
own story.To complete the style only required a little experience to
decide on the best and most agreeable proportions in size and solidity.In a century from the date of this church the required progress had been
made; a century later it had been carried too far, and the artistic
value of the style was lost in mere masonic excellence.San Michele and
the other churches of its age fail principally from over-heaviness of
parts and a certain clumsiness of construction, which, though not
without its value as an expression of power, wants the refinement
necessary for a true work of art.Externally, one of the most pleasing
features of this church is the apse with its circular gallery.In
Italian churches the gallery is usually a simple range of similar
arcades; here, however, it is broken into three great divisions by
coupled shafts springing from the ground, and these again subdivided by
single shafts running in like manner through the whole height of the
apse.The gallery thus not only becomes a part of the whole design,
instead of looking like a possible afterthought, but an agreeable
variety is also given, which adds not a little to the pleasing effect of
the building.View of the Apse of San Michele, Pavia.(From Du
Somerard, ‘Les Arts au Moyen-Age.’)]

There are at least two other churches in Pavia, which, though altered in
many parts, retain their apsidal arrangements tolerably perfect.One of
these, that of San Teodoro (1150), may be somewhat later than the San
Michele, and has its gallery divided into triplets of arcades by bold
flat buttresses springing from the ground.In the other, San Pietro in
Cielo d’Oro, dating from 1132, the arcade is omitted round the apse,
though introduced in the central dome.It has besides two subordinate
apses of graceful design, but inferior to the other examples.Though Milan must have been rich in churches of this age, the only one
now remaining tolerably entire is San Ambrogio, which is so interesting
as almost to make amends for its singularity.Historical evidence shows
that a church existed here from a very early age.It was rebuilt in the
9th century by Bishop Angelbert, aided by the munificence of Louis the
Pious, and an atrium was added by Bishop Anspertus; but except the apse
and “the canons’” tower, nothing remains of even that church, all the
rest having been rebuilt in the 11th or 12th century.During the late
restoration the bases of some of the columns of the 9th-century church
were discovered, and one of them is now visible in the pulpit enclosure.The disposition of the building will be understood from the annexed
plan, which shows both the atrium and the church.The former is
virtually the nave; in other words, had the church been erected on the
colder and stormier side of the Alps, a clerestory would have been added
to the atrium, and it would have been roofed over; and then the plan
would have been nearly identical with that of a Northern cathedral.The third (sexpartite) bay was revaulted in the 14th century with two
oblong quadripartite vaults, but these are now replaced by sexpartite
vaulting.The dome is probably an addition of the end of the 12th
century, and it is raised over what would otherwise have been the fourth
bay of the church.As it is, the atrium (Woodcut No.446) is a highly
pleasing adjunct to the façade, removing the church back from the noisy
world outside, and by its quiet seclusion tending to produce that
devotional feeling so suitable to the entrance of a place of worship.The façade of the building itself, though, like the atrium, only in
brick, is one of the best designs of its age; the upper loggia, or open
gallery, of five bold but unequal arches, producing more shadow than the
façade at Pisa, without the multitude of small parts there crowded
together, and with far more architectural propriety and grace.As seen
from the atrium, with its two towers, one on either flank, it forms a
composition scarcely surpassed by any other in this style.As now restored, the simplicity and line effect of the vaulted interior
is remarkable, and it is also a museum of ecclesiological antiquities of
the best class.The silver altar of Angilbertus (A.D.835) is unrivalled
either for richness or beauty of design by anything of the kind known to
exist elsewhere, and the _baldacchino_ that surmounts it is also of
singular beauty: so are some of its old tombs, of the earliest Christian
workmanship.Its mosaics, its pulpit, and the bronze doors, not to
mention the brazen serpent—said to be the very one erected by Moses in
the wilderness—and innumerable other relics, make this church one of the
most interesting of Italy, if not indeed of all Europe.Atrium of San Ambrogio, Milan.[297])]

Generally speaking, the most beautiful part of a Lombard church is its
eastern end.The apse with its gallery, the transepts, and above all the
dome that almost invariably surmounts their intersection with the choir,
constitute a group which always has a pleasing effect, and is very often
highly artistic and beautiful.The sides of the nave, too, are often
well designed and appropriate; but, with scarcely a single exception,
the west end, or entrance front, is comparatively mean.The building
seems to be cut off at a certain length without any appropriate finish,
or anything to balance the bold projections towards the east.The French
cathedrals, on the contrary, while they entirely escape this defect by
means of their bold western towers, are generally deficient in the
eastern parts, and almost always lack the central dome or tower.The
English Gothic architects alone understood the proper combination of the
three parts.The Italians, when they introduced a tower, almost always
used it as a detached object, and not as a part of the design of the
church.In consequence of this the façades of their churches are
frequently the least happy parts of the composition, notwithstanding the
pains and amount of ornament lavished upon them.Façade of the Cathedral at Piacenza.(From Chapuy,
‘Moyen-Âge Monumental.’)]

The elevation of the cathedral at Piacenza is a fair illustration of the
general mode of treating the western front of the building, not only in
the 11th and 12th centuries, but afterwards, when a church had a façade
at all—for the Italians seem to have been seldom able to satisfy
themselves with this part of their designs, and a great many of their
most important churches have, in consequence, not even now been
completed in this respect.Instead of recessing their doors, as was the practice on this side of
the Alps, the Italians added projecting porches, often of considerable
depth, and supported by two or more slight columns, generally resting on
the backs of symbolical animals.No part of these porches, as an
architectural arrangement, can be deemed worthy of any commendation;
for, in the first place, a column planted on an animal’s back is an
anomaly and an absurdity, and the extreme tenuity of the pillars, as
compared with the mass they support, is so glaring that even its
universality fails in reconciling the eye to the disproportion.In the
present instance the porch is two storeys in height, the upper being a
niche for sculpture.Its almost exact resemblance to the entrance porch
below is therefore a defect.Above there is generally a gallery,
sometimes only in the centre; sometimes, as in this instance, at the
sides, though often carried quite across; and in the centre above this
there is almost invariably a circular window, the tracery of which is
frequently not only elaborately but beautifully ornamented with foliage
and various sculptural devices.Above this there is generally one of those open galleries mentioned
before, following the <DW72> of the roof, though frequently, as in this
instance, this is replaced by a mere belt of semicircular arches,
suggesting an arcade, but in reality only an ornament.Almost every important city in Lombardy shows local peculiarities in its
style, arising from some distinction of race or tradition.The greater
number of these must necessarily be passed over in a work like the
present, but some are so marked as to demand particular mention.Among
these that of Verona seems the most marked and interesting.This Roman
city became the favourite capital of Theodoric the Goth—Dietrich of
Berne, as the old Germans called him—and was by him adorned with many
noble buildings which have either perished or been overlooked.There is
a passage in the writings of his friend Cassiodorus which has hitherto
been a stumbling-block to commentators, but seems to find an explanation
in the buildings here, and to point to the origin of a mode of
decoration worth remarking upon.In talking of the architecture of his
day he speaks of “the reed-like tenuity of the columns making it appear
as if lofty masses of building were supported on upright spears, which
in regard to substance look like hollow tubes.”[298] It might be
supposed that this referred exclusively to the metal architecture of the
use of which we find traces in the paintings at Pompeii and
elsewhere.[299] But the context hardly bears this out, and he is
probably alluding to a stone or marble architecture, which in the
decline of true art had aspired to a certain extent to imitate the
lightness which the metallic form had rendered a favourite.To return to Verona:—The apse of the cathedral seems to have belonged to
an older edifice than that to which it is now attached, as was often the
case, that being the most solid as well as the most sacred part of the
building.449) it is ornamented with
pilasters, classical in design, but more attenuated than any found
elsewhere; so that I cannot but believe that this is either one of the
identical buildings to which Cassiodorus refers, or at least an early
copy from one of them.(From Hope’s ‘History
of Architecture.’)]

At a far later age, in the 12th century, the beautiful church of San
Zenone shows traces of the same style of decoration (Woodcut No.450),
pilasters being used here almost as slight as those at the cathedral,
but so elegant and so gracefully applied as to form one of the most
beautiful decorations of the style.Once introduced, it was of course
repeated in other buildings, though seldom carried to so great an extent
or employed so gracefully as in this instance.Indeed, whether taken
internally or externally, San Zenone may be regarded as one of the most
pleasing and perfect examples of the style to be found in the North of
Italy.The cathedral at Modena is another good example, though not possessing
any features of much novelty or deserving special mention.That of Parma
is also important, though hardly so pleasing.Indeed, scarcely any city
in the Valley of the Po is without some more or less-perfect churches of
this date, none showing any important peculiarities that have not been
exemplified above, unless perhaps it is the apse of the church of San
Donato on the Murano near Venice, which is decorated with a richness of
marble decoration to which the purer Gothic style never attained, and
which entitles this church to rank rather with the Byzantine than with
the Lombard buildings of which we are treating, or a style so curiously
exceptional as to make it one of the most interesting churches,
historically, to be found in the North of Italy.Façade of San Zenone, Verona.Recent discoveries in Syria[300] have proved almost beyond a doubt that
the carved slabs with which it is adorned externally were borrowed from
some desecrated building on the coast of Syria—destroyed probably by the
Moslems—and brought to Venice, probably at the time when the church
acquired the remains of San Donato, in the beginning of the 12th
century.Whether brought then or at an earlier period, they belong to
the age of Justinian, certainly came from the East, and, mixed up with
Italian details of the period, make up an exterior as picturesque as it
is interesting to the student of the history of art in those days.It is extremely difficult to draw a line between the pointed and
round-arched Gothic styles in Italy.The former was so evidently a
foreign importation, so unwillingly received and so little understood,
that it made its way but slowly.Even, for instance, in the church at
Vercelli, which is usually quoted as the earliest example of the pointed
style in Italy (built 1219-1222), there is not a pointed arch nor a
trace of one on the exterior.All the windows and openings are
round-headed, and, except the pier-arches and vaults, nothing pointed
appears anywhere.Even at a later date than this the round arch,
especially as a decorative form, is frequently placed above the pointed
one, and always used in preference to it.Instead, therefore, of
attempting to draw a line where none exists in reality, it will be
better now to pass on from this part of the subject, and to take up the
older style at a point from which we can best trace the formation of the
new.The latter does not essentially differ from the former, except in
the introduction of the French form of the pointed arch and its
accompaniments.It remains only to say a few words on the peculiarities
which the round form of churches took in the hands of the early Lombard
architects, as well as on the campanile, which forms so striking a
feature in the cities of Northern Italy.On the boundary-line which separates the Guelfic from the Ghibelline
influence, there exist at Toscanella, near Viterbo, two churches of
great beauty of detail; but which, as might almost be predicated from
their situation, defy any attempt at classification.They are not
Gothic, for they have no vaults, nor does their style suggest any
vaulting contrivances.They are scarcely debased Roman, for the tracery
of their circular windows, their many-shafted doors, and generally their
details are such as to indicate a Northern rather than a Roman affinity;
and the Byzantine sculpture which is found in the pulpit was probably
taken from an earlier church—though an Italian Byzantine influence can
be traced in much of its decoration.Under these circumstances, it is
better to treat them as exceptional, than to attempt to give them a name
which might mislead without conveying any correct information.Maria, was erected in the
beginning of the 13th century (1206?), but is so unlike most buildings
of that age, that it is usually ascribed to the 6th or 7th.On a close
examination, however, all its details are found to be full of advanced
Romanesque forms.The pillars are rude Corinthian, with a Lombardic
abacus.They are widely spaced, having no vault to support; and the
mouldings of the arches are what we should call “Transitional Early
English.”

[Illustration: 451.Externally the façade is too plain to be quite pleasing, but this arises
from its depending originally on painting for its decoration—some traces
of which still remain, but the greater part has perished.Its three
doorways are richly and beautifully ornamented with shafts and
sculptured foliage, quite equal in detail to anything of the class to be
found in Italy, and its great circular window would not be thought out
of place at Chartres or Lincoln.Pietro is probably a century later than that of Sta.Maria, and its façade is richer and more elegant—a difference arising
more from those details being in this instance carved which in the
earlier church were painted.The design, however, deserves attention for
its historical, perhaps, even more than its artistic claims; for it was
this class of façade that Palladio and the architects of the
cinque-cento period seized upon, and, applying pilasters and pediments
of classical type, converted it into the fashionable churches which are
to be found in every part of Europe.[301]

[Illustration: 453.Elevation of the Exterior of Sta.The difficulty which the Italians never entirely conquered, was how to
amalgamate the sloping lines of the roofs of the aisles with the
horizontal lines of the rest of the façade.The gallery over the central
doorway enabled them very nearly to accomplish it in these Toscanella
churches, and if the same string-courses had been carried all across,
the whole might have been harmonised; but it was just missed, and, what
is strange, more so in the second than in the first example.In the earliest times of Christian architecture, as we have already
seen, the circular form of church was nearly as frequent as that derived
from the Roman basilica.In process of time the latter was found to be
much better adapted to the extended requirements of Christianity.Hence
in the 11th and 12th centuries, when so many of the early churches were
rebuilt and enlarged, most of the old circular buildings disappeared.Enough, however, remain to enable us to trace, though imperfectly, what
their arrangements were.Among those which have been illustrated, perhaps the most interesting is
that known as the church of San Stefano at Bologna, or rather the
circular centre of that congeries of seven churches usually known by
that name.It is one of those numerous churches of which it is impossible to
predicate whether it was originally a baptismal or a sepulchral edifice.In old times it bore both names, and may have had both destinations, but
latterly, at all events, the question has been settled by the compromise
usually adopted in such cases, of dedicating it to the first martyr, to
whom a sepulchral form of building is especially appropriate.Plan of the Duomo, Brescia.Elevation of Duomo at Brescia.Notwithstanding a considerable amount of ancient remains mixed up in the
details, no part of the present church seems older than the Carlovingian
era; while, on the other hand, its extreme irregularity and clumsiness
of construction point to a period before the 11th century.Its general
form is that of an extremely irregular octagon, about 60 ft.in
diameter, in the centre of which stands a circlet of columns, some
coupled, some single, supporting a semicircular dome.The circumscribing
aisle is covered with the usual intersecting ribbed vault of the 10th
century, but the whole is so rude as scarcely to deserve mention except
for its antiquity.The Duomo Vecchio of Brescia is ascribed to the 8th or 9th century, but
this date according to Cattaneo[302] can only be ascribed to an earlier
basilica church, the crypt of which still exists on the east side of the
Duomo.As will be seen from the plan, it is a large church, 125 ft.across over all, and is covered by a dome 65 ft.in diameter internally
supported by eight piers of plain design.The mode in which light is
introduced into the central compartment illustrates the various
tentative expedients by which the architects in that age attempted to
accomplish their object.First, there is a range of small windows in the
dome below the springing of the dome.In the dome itself there are four
circular sides, and, as if the architect felt that he was doing
something unusual and inartistic, he managed externally to confuse these
with the rudiments of the roof gallery.(From Isabelle, ‘Édifices Circulaires.’)
Scale 50 ft.It is not clear whether originally it had or was intended to have an
apse between its two round towers—where the foundations of some
buildings can still be traced; but these may be the remains of the early
church referred to.Turning from these, we find the round-arched Gothic style completely
developed in the church of San Tomaso in Limine, near Bergamo.From the
annexed plan it will be seen that the circular part is the nave or
entrance, as in Germany and England, in contradistinction to the French
mode of arrangement, where the circular part is always the sanctum, the
rectangular the nave or less holy place.In the centre stand eight pillars, supporting a
vaulted gallery, which forms a triforium or upper storey, and, with the
dome and its little cupola, raise the whole height to about 50 ft.A
small choir with a semicircular niche projects eastward.The dimensions of the building are so small that it hardly deserves
notice, except as a perfect example of the style of the 11th or 12th
century in Lombardy, and for a certain propriety and elegance of design,
in which it is not surpassed, internally at least, by any building of
its age.It is to be regretted that the idea was never carried out (at
any rate no example remains) on such a scale as to enable us to judge of
the effect of such a domical arrangement as is here attempted.The great
defect of all one-storeyed domes is their lowness, both internally and
more especially externally.This method of building a dome in two
storeys would seem calculated to obviate the objection; but though
common in small sepulchral chambers, it has never been tried on a scale
sufficiently large to enable us to judge of its real effect.After this
period the circular shape was so completely superseded by the
rectangular, that no further improvement took place in it.There is perhaps no question of early Christian archæology involved in
so much obscurity as that of the introduction and early use of towers.The great monumental pillars of the Romans—as, for instance, those of
Trajan and Antoninus—were practically towers; and latterly their tombs
began to assume an aspiring character like that at St.231), or those at Palmyra and elsewhere in the East, which show a marked
tendency in that direction.But none of these can be looked upon as an
undoubted prototype of the towers attached to the churches of the
Christians.At Ravenna, as early as the age of Justinian, we find a circular tower
attached to St.Apollinare in Classe (Woodcut No.412), and in the other
churches of that place they seem even then to have been considered
necessary adjuncts.[303] At the same time it is by no means clear that
they were erected as bell-towers; indeed the evidence is tolerably clear
that bells were not used in Christian churches till the time of Pope
Adrian I., some two centuries later.There is, I
think, no trace of their being sepulchral monuments, or that they were
designed or used as tombs; and unless they were, like the _sthambas_ of
the Buddhists, pillars of victory, or towers erected to mark sacred or
remarkable spots, it is difficult to say what they were, or where we are
to look for an analogy.Be this as it may, the oldest circular towers with which we are
acquainted are those of Ravenna; while the last of the series is the
famous leaning one at Pisa, commenced in the year 1174.The gradations
between these two extremes must have been the same that marked the
changes in the architecture of the churches to which they are attached;
but the links are more completely wanting in the case of the towers than
in that of the churches.[304]

[Illustration: 459.(From Gutensohn and
Knapp.)]Apollinare in Classe, above referred to, the most
perfect of those of Ravenna, is a simple brick tower (see Woodcut No.412), nine storeys in height, the lower windows being narrow single
openings; above there are two, and the three upper storeys are adorned
with four windows of three lights each.In Rome, as far as we know, the first tower attached to a church was
that said to have been built by Pope Adrian I. in front of the atrium of
St.Peter’s; but there are no examples now existing in Rome which can be
said to be earlier than the 11th century, and that date applies only to
the lower portion of them.In the 12th and 13th centuries they became
common, and we find them attached to the churches of S. Lorenzo without
the walls, S. Croce in Gerusalemme, SS.Giovanni e Paolo, S. Giorgio in
Velabro (13th century), and others.All these are square in plan and
extremely similar in design, no improvement and scarcely any change
having taken place between the first and the last, as if the form were
an old and established one when we find it first adopted.Maria in Cosmedin (Woodcut No.459) is perhaps one of the best
and most complete.Its dimensions are small, its breadth being little
more than 15 ft., and its height only 110; but notwithstanding this
there is great dignity in the design, and, in a city where buildings are
not generally tall, its height is sufficient to give it prominence
without overpowering other objects,—a characteristic which renders these
Roman towers not only beautiful structures in themselves, but
appropriate ornaments to the buildings to which they are attached.The chief interest of these towers is derived from the numerous progeny
to which they gave birth: for though there is scarcely an instance of a
square Romanesque tower beyond the walls of Rome during the period in
which this style flourished, the form was seized upon with avidity by
the Gothic architects in all the countries of Europe; and whether as a
detached campanile (as in Italy), or as an integral part of the building
(as we soon find it employed on this side of the Alps), it forms the
most prominent, and perhaps also the most beautiful, feature in the
aspiring architecture of the Middle Ages.There is certainly no architectural feature which the Gothic architects
can so justly call their own as the towers and spires which in the
Middle Ages were so favourite, so indispensable a part of their churches
and other edifices, becoming in fact as necessary parts of the external
design as the vaults were of the internal decoration of the building.It is true, as before remarked, that we neither know where they were
first invented, nor even where they were first applied to Christian
churches—those of Rome and Ravenna being evidently not the earliest
examples; nor have they any features which betray their origin—at least
none have yet been pointed out, though it is not impossible that a
closer examination would bring some such to light.They certainly are as
little classical, in form or details, as anything that can well be
conceived; and belong to an undefined Romanesque style.Those of which we have already spoken are all church-towers—_campaniles_
or bell-towers attached to churches.But this exclusive distinction by
no means applies to the Gothic towers.Mark at Venice,
for instance, and the Toraccio at Cremona, are evidently civic
monuments, like the belfries of the Low Countries—symbols of communal
power wholly distinct from the church, their proximity to which seems
only to arise from the fact of all the principal buildings being grouped
together.This is certainly the case with a large class of very ugly
buildings in Italy, such as those attached to the town-halls of Florence
and Siena, or the famous Asinelli and Garisenda towers at Bologna.They
are merely tall square brick towers, with a machicolated balcony at the
top, but possessing no more architectural design than the chimney of a
cotton factory.Originally, when lower, they may have been towers of
defence, but afterwards became mere symbols of power.A third class, and by far the most numerous, of these buildings are
undoubtedly ecclesiastical erections; they are either actually attached
to the churches, or so placed with regard to them as to leave no doubt
on the matter.There is not, however, I believe, in all Italy a single
example of a tower or towers forming, as on this side of the Alps, an
integral part of the design.Sometimes they stand detached, but more generally are connected with
some angle of the building, the favourite position being the western
angle of the southern transept.Occasionally we find one tower placed at
the angle of the façade, but this is seldom the case when the tower and
the church are of the same age.It is so in the cathedral at Lucca, and
San Ambrogio at Milan; in the latter of which a second tower has been
added more recently to balance the older one.It does also happen as in
the instance of Novara, before quoted (Woodcut No.443), that two towers
are actually parts of the original design; this, however, is certainly
the exception, not the rule.In design the Italian campaniles differ very considerably from those on
this side of the Alps.They never have projecting buttresses, nor assume
that pyramidal form which is so essential and so beautiful a feature in
the Northern examples.In plan the campanile is always square, and
carried up without break or offset to two-thirds at least of its
intended height.This, which is virtually the whole design (for the
spire seems an idea borrowed from the North), is generally solid to a
considerable height, or with only such openings as serve to admit light
to the stairs or inclined planes.Above the solid part one round-headed
window is introduced in each face, and in the next storey two; in the
one above this three, then four, and lastly five, the lights being
merely separated by slight shafts, so that the upper storey is virtually
an open loggia (see Woodcut No.There is no doubt great beauty and
propriety of design in this arrangement; in point of taste it is
unobjectionable, but it wants the vigour and variety of the Northern
tower.So far as we can judge from drawings and such ancient examples as
remain, the original termination was a simple cone in the centre, with a
smaller one at each of the angles.At Verona an octagonal lantern is added, and at Modena and Cremona the
octagon is crowned by a lofty spire, but these hardly come within the
limits of the epoch of which we are now treating.So greatly did the
Italians prefer the round arch, that even in their imitation of the
Northern styles they used the pointed shape only when compelled—a
circumstance which makes it extremely difficult, particularly in the
towers, to draw the line between the two styles; for though pointed
arches were no doubt introduced in the 13th and 14th centuries, the
circular-headed shape continued to be employed from the age of the
Romanesque to that of the Renaissance.One of the oldest and certainly the most celebrated of the Gothic towers
of Italy, is that of St.Mark’s at Venice, commenced in the year 902; it
took the infant republic three centuries to raise it 180 ft., to the
point at which the square basement terminates.On this there must
originally have been an open loggia of some sort, no doubt with a
conical roof.The present superstructure was added in the 16th century;
but though the loggia is a very pleasing feature, it is overpowered by
the solid mass that it surmounts, and by the extremely ugly square
extinguisher that crowns the whole.Its locality and its associations
have earned for it a great deal of undue laudation, but in point of
design no campanile in Italy deserves it less.The base is a mere
unornamented mass of brickwork, slightly fluted, and pierced
unsymmetrically with small windows to light the inclined plane within.Its size, its height, and its apparent solidity are its only merits.These are no doubt important elements in that low class of architectural
excellence of which the Egyptian pyramids are the type; but even in
these elements this edifice must confess itself a pigmy, and inferior to
even a second-class pyramid on the banks of the Nile, while it has none
of the beauty of design and detail displayed by the Giralda of Seville,
or even by other Italian towers in its own neighbourhood.The campanile at Piacenza (Woodcut No.448) is, perhaps, more like the
original of St.Mark’s than any other, and certainly displays as little
beauty as any building of this sort can possess.That of San Zenone at Verona is far more pleasing.It is, indeed, as
beautiful both in proportion and details as any of its age, while it
exemplifies at once the beauties and the defects of the style.Among the
first is an elegant simplicity that always is pleasing, but this is
accompanied by a leanness and poverty of effect, when compared with
Northern examples, which must rank in the latter category.Jackson, in his work on Dalmatia and Istria, gives illustrations of
several towers in those countries which, in beauty of design, excel many
of the Italian examples.The Romanesque style would seem to have had a
much longer duration on the east side of the Adriatic than in Italy.Thus the tower of Spalato, a lofty campanile of six storeys in height,
commenced in the beginning of the 13th century and not terminated till
1416 (except the upper octagon and spire), is virtually in the same pure
Romanesque style throughout.Jackson notes also the continued
influence of Roman work of the 3rd century, by which it is surrounded,
and that fragments of ancient material, columns and capitals, have been
used up in its construction.The campaniles of Zara and in the island of
Arbe are both fine examples of Romanesque design.CHAPTER V.

It would be easier to define the limits and character of the styles of
Italian Mediæval Architecture in the centre and south of Italy by a
negative than a positive title.To call them the “non-Gothic” styles
would describe them correctly, but would hardly suffice to convey a
distinct idea of their peculiarities.Romanesque, or even Italian
Romanesque, would not be sufficient, because that term fails to take
cognizance of the foreign element found in them.That element is the
Byzantine, derived partly from the continued relations which such cities
as Venice or Pisa maintained during the Middle Ages with the Levant, and
partly from the intercourse which the inhabitants of Magna Gracia kept
up across the Adriatic with the people on its eastern shores.To such a
mixture of styles the term Byzantine-Romanesque would be quite
appropriate; and although there are in Apulia churches, such as Molfetta
and St.Angelo, which look more like Levantine designs than anything to
be found in other parts of Europe (except perhaps such buildings as St.Front, Périgueux, and one or two exceptional buildings in the South of
France), and in a very detailed description of Italian styles it might
be expedient to attempt a further subdivision with other specific terms,
for the present it will probably suffice to describe the various
non-Gothic styles of the centre and southern half of Italy in local
sections without attempting any very minute classification of their
variations.As the Italians had no great national style of their own,
and both in the North and South were principally working under foreign
influences, it is in vain to look for any thread that will conduct the
student straight through the labyrinth of their styles.Italian unity is
the aspiration of the present century; during the Middle Ages it did not
exist either in politics or art.The Old and New Cathedrals at Naples.Although Naples is in the very centre of its province, where we
naturally first look for examples of the style, there are few cities in
Italy which contain so little to interest the architect or the
antiquary.Still she does possess one group of churches, which, by their
juxtaposition, at least serve to illustrate the progress of the style
during the Middle Ages.Restituta—shaded
dark in the plan (Woodcut No.460)—may be as old as the 4th or 5th
century, and retains its original plan and arrangement, though much
disfigured in details.The baptistery, a little behind the apse on its
left, is certainly of the date indicated, and retains its mosaics, which
seem to be of the same age.of Anjou commenced the new cathedral at
right angles with the old, his French prejudices being apparently
shocked at the incorrect orientation of the older church.It is a
spacious building, 300 ft.long, arranged, as Italian churches usually
were at that age, with a wooden roof over the nave and intersecting
vaults over the side-aisles.Opposite the entrance of the old cathedral
is a domical chapel of Renaissance design, so that the group contains an
illustration of each of the three ages of Italian art.Section of San Miniato, near Florence.The church of San Miniato (Woodcuts Nos.461-463), on a hill overlooking
Florence, is one of the earliest (1013), as well as one of the most
perfect, of the Byzantine-Romanesque style.in length by 70 in width, divided longitudinally into aisles, and
transversely into three nearly square compartments by clustered piers
supporting two great arches which run up to the roof.The whole of the
eastern compartment is occupied by a crypt or under-church open to the
nave, above which are the choir and apse, approached by flights of steps
in the aisles.The entire arrangement, together with the division of the
nave into three compartments, is most satisfactory, and the proportions
of the whole are very appropriate.The pillars themselves are so nearly
classical in design that they almost seem to have been taken from some
ancient building, and the architraves and stringcourses are all well
designed and fitted to the places they occupy.The principal ornament of
the interior is an inlaid pattern of simple design, sufficient to
relieve the monotony of the interior, but without producing any
confusion.The exterior depends principally, like the interior, for its
effect on  panelling, but has a range of blind arches running
round the sides and across the front.The façade, however, is very badly
designed: either it was one of the earliest examples, and the architects
had not learned how to combine the sloping roofs of the aisles with the
upper part of the façades, or it has been altered in more modern times;
but for this slight defect it would be difficult to find a church in
Italy containing more of classic elegance, with perfect appropriateness
for the purposes of Christian worship.There must have been several, probably many, buildings in the same style
erected in Tuscany during the first half of the 11th century.Otherwise
it is almost impossible to understand how so complete a design as that
of Pisa Cathedral could have been executed.It was commenced apparently
in 1006, but it was not till 1063, after the plundering of Palermo,
according to Reber,[305] that the means were provided for the
extraordinary richness of the design, the magnificence of which had at
that time no parallel among the ecclesiastical edifices of Italy; the
work was suspended in 1095, and could only be resumed by means of
pecuniary aid given to the undertaking by the Byzantine emperor.After
the consecration of the cathedral in 1103, the interior decorations were
carried on until the 15th century.Internally its design is evidently
based on that of the basilicas of Rome and Ravenna, except that instead
of the range at the latter place of figures in mosaic, it has a splendid
triforium gallery and in plan strongly marked projecting transepts.Its
great merit, however, as a design arises from the fact that the builders
had learned to proportion the parts to one another so as to get greater
magnificence with very much smaller dimensions.The size, for instance,
of the nave of San Paolo fuori le Mure at Rome is 290 ft.by 215; these
dimensions are nearly double those at Pisa, where they are 173 ft.Yet, in consequence of the greater relative height of the nave and
the better spacing of the pillars and proportion of the parts, the
interior of Pisa is more pleasing and more impressive than the Roman
church.Its effect, too, is immensely increased by the truly Mediæval
projection of the transepts.In no church in Italy is there such poetry
of perspective as in looking anglewise across the intersection, and
seldom anywhere a more satisfactory interior than that of this church.(From Chapuy’s
‘Moyen-Age Monumental.’)]

The exterior, too, is almost equally pleasing.The side-aisles are
adorned with a range of blind arches running all round, adorned with
parti- marble, inlaid either in courses or in patterns.Above
this is a gallery, representing the triforium, carried all round, and in
the façades formed into an open gallery; a second open gallery
represents the sloping roof of the aisles, a third the clerestory, a
fourth the <DW72>s of the great roof.The difficulty here, as in almost
all Italian designs, is caused by the sloping roofs; but, with this
exception, the whole makes up a rich and varied composition without any
glaring false construction, and expresses with sufficient clearness the
arrangements of the interior.The dome is of later design, and, being
oval in plan, cannot be said to be pleasing in outline.The Italians were evidently delighted with their new style.It was
repeated with very little variation at Lucca, in the church of San
Michele (1188), only that the arcades stood free on the sides as well as
on the front.The façade of San Martino, in the same city, is in the
same style; so is that of the cathedral at Pistoja, and so is Sta.The arrangement was probably suggested by the porticoes of
Pagan temples; and were it not for the awkwardness caused by the sloping
line of the roofs, it might be characterised as one of the most
successful inventions of the age.In some instances, as in the façade of the Cathedral at Zara in Dalmatia
(Woodcut No.Jackson[306] was not begun
before the 13th century, the consecration taking place in 1285, the
difficulties of the design of the façade are to a great extent conquered
by reducing the arcades to mere decorative panelling, and more than this
by separating the design of the centre from that of the aisles by a bold
square pilaster.This is exactly the feature we miss at Pisa and Lucca,
where the want of it imparts a considerable degree of weakness to the
whole design.(From Sir Gardner
Wilkinson’s ‘Dalmatia and Montenegro.’)]

The plan of the Zara Cathedral (Woodcut No.466) is that usually adopted
in churches of this class; but it possesses a lady chapel and
baptistery, placed laterally in a somewhat unusual manner.Its
dimensions are small, being only 170 ft.The east end of this church, its doorways and windows, show, as might be
expected from its locality, a greater tendency towards Romanesque art
than can be found on the western shores of the Peninsula, but in
internal arrangements it belongs wholly to the Italian style.The cathedral at Trau, also in Dalmatia, illustrated in Mr.Jackson’s
work, is a fine example, which is not only built in one consistent style
throughout, but possesses the still rarer advantage of being completed
outside as well as inside, “instead,” as Mr.Jackson observes, “of
presenting, like so many Italian churches, a rough face of unfinished
brickwork or masonry awaiting in vain the splendid veneer of marble or
sculpture that never comes.” The main part of the church was built in
the first half of the 13th century.The floor is of the basilica type,
with nave (five bays, vaulted) and aisles, centre and side apses, and a
magnificent narthex, the full width of nave and aisles, with a sumptuous
portal of pure Romanesque design (1240), which is perhaps finer than any
example in Italy, and is only rivalled in its decorative sculpture by
those of the French portals.Jackson is of opinion that Dalmatian
art took a great departure under Hungarian rule, and followed more in
the direction of the purer Romanesque style than in that of the
Byzantine.The artists were foreigners, invited not only from Germany
but also from France.Villars d’Honecourt recounts his having been sent
for, and “French influence,” Mr.Jackson states, “may be detected in
some other churches in Hungary.” The portal of the church at Jak, in
Hungary, illustrated in Mr.Jackson’s work, is French in character, with
a profusion of orders carved with the zigzag fret and dentil very
similar to the later Norman work, and includes capitals “à crochet” such
as belong to French 12th-century work.The series of trefoil-headed
niches, with figures in them which rise above the doorway, are French in
character, and remind one of the façade of St.Père-sous-Vezelay.At
Cattaro, in Dalmatia, and at Veglia, in one of the islands of the
Quarnero, are other examples of fine Romanesque work of the 12th
century.Further south on the mainland of Italy, at Troja, we find a singularly
elegant cathedral church (1093-1115?)Its flanks and apse are perhaps even more elegant than anything in
the neighbourhood of Pisa.So is the lower part of its façade, which is
adorned with a richness and elegance of foliage characteristic of the
province where it is found; and the cornice that crowns the lower storey
is perhaps unmatched by any similar example to be found in Italy, either
for beauty of sculptural decoration or for appropriateness of profile.The upper part of the façade differs, however, considerably from that of
the examples just quoted.A great rose-window, of elegant but
ill-understood tracery, takes the place of the arcades, and, with the
sculptured arch over it, completes all that remains of the original
design.The plain pieces of walling that support the central window are
parts of a modern repair.As a general rule, all the churches in the South of Italy are small.This one at Troja is arranged in plan like that at Pisa, with bold
projecting transepts, but its length is only 167 ft., and the width of
its nave 50, while in the Northern cathedral these dimensions are nearly
double—310 ft.by 106—and the area four times as great.This is true of
all, however elegant they may be—they are parish churches in dimensions
as compared with their Northern rivals.Many also, as the cathedral at Bari (Woodcut No.469), have their apses
internal, which detracts very much from the meaning of the design, and
does away with the apsidal terminations, which are perhaps the most
beautiful features in the external design of Italian churches; while
they lack the great traceried windows which go so far to replace the
absence of the apse in English design.The annexed elevation of the east
end at Bari (Woodcut No.470) gives a fair idea of the general
arrangement of that part in the churches in Apulia.It is novel, and the
two tall towers with a central dome combine with elegant details to make
up a whole which it is impossible not to admire though it will not bear
comparison with the more artistic arrangements of Northern architects.Where the apse[308] is allowed to be seen externally, it is sometimes,
as at San Pellino (Woodcut No.471), an object of great beauty and
originality, but such examples are rare in the province, and the designs
suffer in proportion.(From a Sketch by
A. J. R. Gawen, Esq.)]In the richer churches, as at Pisa, a blind arcade is carried round the
flanks, sometimes with an open gallery under the eaves, as in German
churches, but this was far from being universally the case; on the
contrary, it would be difficult, as a typical example of the style, to
select one more characteristic than the flank of the church of Caserta
Vecchia (1100-1153) (Woodcut No.The windows are small but
numerous, and mark the number of bays in the interior.The transept is
slightly projected, and ornamented with an arcade at the top, and above
this rises a dome such as is found only in Calabria or Sicily.The tower
was added afterwards, and, though unsymmetrical, assists in relieving a
design which would otherwise run the risk of being monotonous.West Front of the Church of San Nicolo in Bari.(From a Sketch by A. J. R. Gawen, Esq.)]It was, however, on their entrance façades that the architects of
Southern Italy lavished their utmost care.The central doorways are
usually covered with rich hoods, supported by pillars resting on
monsters somewhat like those found in the North of Italy.Above this is
either a gallery or one or two windows, and the whole generally
terminates in a circular rose-window filled with tracery.As exemplified
in the front of Bittonto Cathedral (Woodcut No.473), such a composition
is not deficient in richness, though hardly pleasing as an architectural
composition.The same arrangement, on about the same scale, occurs at Bari, Altamura,
and Ruvo; and on a somewhat smaller scale in the churches of Galatina,
Brindisi, and Barletta.The great and peculiar beauty of the cathedral
at Bittonto is its south front, one angle of which is shown in the
woodcut; but which becomes richer towards the east, where it is adorned
with a portal of great magnificence and beauty.The richness of its open
gallery (under what was the roof of the side-aisles) is unsurpassed in
Apulia, and probably by anything of the same kind in Italy.View of the Interior of San Nicolo, Bari.The façade of San Nicolo at Bari (1197) is something like the last
mentioned, except that handsome Corinthian columns have been borrowed
from some older building, and add to the richness of the design, though
they hardly can be said to belong to the composition.Internally this
church seems to have displayed some such arrangement as that of San
Miniato (Woodcuts No.Instead, however, of improving upon it,
as might be expected from the time that had elapsed since the previous
one was erected, the Southern architect hardly knew the meaning of what
he was attempting.He grouped together the three pillars next to the
entrance, and threw arches across the nave from them, but these arches
neither support the roof nor aid the construction in any other way.They
do add to the perspective effect of the interior, but it is only by a
theatrical contrivance very rare in the Middle Ages, and by no means to
be admired when found.Most of these Apulian churches possess crypts almost as important as
that of San Miniato, some more so; and the numerous pillars in some of
these give rise to effects of perspective only to be found elsewhere in
such buildings as the Mosque at Cordova, or the cisterns at
Constantinople.As in the annexed example, from the cathedral at
Otranto, it is wonderful what space and what variety may be attained
with small dimensions by the employment of numerous points of support.This was the secret of most of the best effects produced by the Northern
architects; but the Italians never understood it, or practised it,
except in crypts.Perhaps it may have been that they thought it
necessary to sacrifice architectural effect to the exigencies of public
worship.Whether this were the cause or not, the result, as already
pointed out, was fatal to the architectural effect of many of their
designs, especially in the Northern province.In Southern Italy this is seldom the case, but the difference arose from
the fact that the naves of the churches had never vaulted roofs, and
were consequently separated from the aisles by single pillars instead of
composite piers.This took away all temptation to display mechanical
dexterity, and left the architect free to produce the best artistic
effect he was able to design with the materials at his command.Window in the South Side of the Cathedral Church at
Matera.No one who takes the pains to familiarise himself with the architecture
of these Southern Italian churches, can well fail to be impressed with
their beauty.That beauty will be found, however, to arise not so much
from the dimensions or arrangement of their plans, or the form of their
outline, as from the grace and elegance of their details.Every feature
displays the feeling of an elegant and refined people, who demanded
decoration as a necessity, though they were incapable of rising to any
great architectural conception.They excelled as ornamentists, though at
best only indifferent architects.It is impossible to render this evident in such a work as the present;
but besides the examples already given, a window (Woodcut No.478) from
the cathedral church at Matera (1270) will explain how unlike the style
of decoration is to anything with which we are familiar in the North,
and at the same time how much picturesque effect may be produced by a
repetition of similar details.The church itself has this peculiarity,
that its west front is plain and unimportant, and that all the
decoration is lavished on the south side, which faces the piazza.There
are two entrances on this face, that towards the east being, as usual,
the richer.Above these is a range of richly-ornamented windows, one of
which—a little out of the centre—is far more splendid than the rest
(Woodcut No.From this it is said that letters and rescripts from
the Greek patriarch at Constantinople used to be read, and it is perhaps
as elaborate a specimen of the mode of decoration used in these churches
as can be found in the province.Doorway of Church of Pappacoda, Naples.The same exuberance of decoration continued to be employed down to the
latest period of the art, and after Northern forms had been introduced
by the Angiovine dynasty at Naples.The doorway from the church at
Pappacoda (Woodcut No.479) is a type of many to be found in that city
and elsewhere in the architectural province.True, it is overdone to
such an extent that much of the labour bestowed upon it must be
considered as thrown away; but if a love of art induced people to labour
so lovingly in it, it is hard to refuse them the admiration which their
enthusiasm deserves.Another class of ornamental detail in which this province is especially
rich is that of bronze doors, of which some six or seven examples still
remain.Of these perhaps the finest are those of the cathedral at Trani.They were made in 1160, and for beauty of design, and for the exuberance
and elegance of their ornaments, are unsurpassed by anything of the kind
in Italy, or probably in the world.Another pair of doors of almost
equal beauty, made in 1119, belongs to the cathedral at Troja (Woodcut
No.468), and a third, which is still in a very perfect state,
constructed at Constantinople, in the year 1076, for the church of Mont
San Angelo; and is consequently contemporary with the doors of Sta.Sophia, Novogorod, and San Zenone, Verona, and so similar in design as
to form an interesting series for comparison.Other churches in the same style as those mentioned above are found at
Canosa, Giovenazzo, Molo, Ostuni, Manduria, and other places in the
province.Those of Brindisi, from which we should expect most, have been
too much modernised to be of value as examples; but there is in the town
a small circular church of great beauty, built apparently by the Knights
Templars, and afterwards possessed by the Knights of St.It is now
in ruins, but many of the frescoes which once adorned its walls still
remain, as well as the marble pillars that supported its roof.Being at
some distance from the harbour, the Knights of St.John built another
small church near the port, which still remains nearly unaltered.Although throughout the Middle Ages Rome went on building large
churches, it was in the debased-Roman style already referred to, fitting
together Roman pillars with classical details of more or less purity,
but hardly, except in their cloisters, deserving the name of a style.Perhaps the most original, as it certainly is one of the most beautiful,
things the Romans did, is the cloister of St.There the
little arcades, supported by twisted columns, and adorned with mosaics,
are as graceful and pleasing as anything of that class found elsewhere;
and as they are encased in a framework of sufficient strength to take
off all appearance of mechanical weakness, their unconstructive forms
are not unpleasing.The entablature, which is the ruling feature in the
design, retains the classical arrangement in almost every detail, and in
such purity as could only be found in Rome in the 13th century, when
this cloister appears to have been erected; but the style never extended
beyond the limits of that city, and thus has little bearing on the
thread of our narrative.The cloister of the Benedictine monastery adjoining the basilica of St.Paul’s outside the walls, is another example of the same kind in which
the columns present almost every variety of form; spiral, twisted,
fluted, and sometimes two or three of these combined, many of them, as
well as the entablature, being covered with mosaics.As already remarked, the architects of the southern half of the Italian
peninsula were generally content to adopt the Romanesque plan of
covering their naves with a wooden roof—for when an intersecting vault
is found it is clearly a French or German interpolation—but they often
employed one dome, generally over the altar, and used it as an ornament
both external and internal.The two illustrations already given of the
domes at Bari (Woodcut No.470) and Caserta Vecchia (Woodcut No.472)
show the form these usually took in the province.They belong to a type
not unusual in the East, but unknown to the Gothic architects of Europe.When called upon to roof their churches with stone, they almost
invariably adopted the domical in preference to the vaulted form, as at
Molfetta (1162), where they make a pleasing form of roof, not unlike
that of Loches Cathedral (Woodcut No.The great defect of domes
when thus employed is their height, which generally throws the whole of
the building out of proportion; and unless light is introduced through
openings in the drum, or in the dome itself, they are dark and gloomy.This is certainly the case at Molfetta, but otherwise the church seems
well designed and of pleasing proportions.To be successful, domes
should be low and flat internally; and any height required externally
must be given by a false dome, as at St.Mark’s, or as done by the
Renaissance architects generally.This was not so much felt when the building was square, and covered by
only one dome, like the baptistery or tomb of Mont St.Angelo, where
effect of space on the floor was not aimed at so much as a combination
of external dignity with limited dimensions in plan, and was attained by
the arrangement adopted.As will be observed, the pointed arch, as in
the tower at Gaeta (Woodcut No.489), is used in the basement, but above
this round arches with balusters for pillars, such as we should call
Saxon, though their age here may be the 12th century.Among the little bits of Orientalism that crop up here and there all
over the province, one of the most pleasing is the little tomb of
Bohemund at Canosa (1111).It is charming to find in Italy an Eastern
Kibleh with its dome, erected to contain the remains of a Christian
king.Though elegant, however, the dome is not fitted to the square, as
it would have been in more experienced hands, and the whole design is
somewhat badly put together.Its bronze doors are among its chiefest
ornaments, and are elegant, though inferior to numerous examples of the
same class in the churches of the province.Many other examples of Byzantine domical forms might be quoted as
existing in Southern Italy.It is not, however, so much in the forms as
in the details that the Eastern influence is felt, and that no less in
the churches which retain the basilican form of Ravenna than in those
which assume the domical form of Constantinople.The buildings of the Southern Province cannot certainly compete with
those of the Northern either in size or in daring mechanical
construction, but in detail they are frequently more beautiful, while
their forms are more national and less constrained.Their great
interest, however, in the eyes of the student, consists in their forming
a link between the Eastern and Western worlds, and thus joining together
two styles which we have hitherto been too much in the habit of
considering as possessing no point of contact.One of the best known, as well as one of the largest examples of this
class of buildings in Italy, is the baptistery at Pisa (seen partially
on the left side of Woodcut No.Internally it is, as nearly as may
be, 100 ft.in diameter, and the walls are about 8 ft.The dome itself, however, is only 60 ft.in diameter, and is
supported on four piers and eight pillars.These serve to separate the
central space from the aisle which runs round it, and which is two
storeys in height, but singularly ill-proportioned and clumsy in detail.The worst part of the design, however, is the dome, if dome it can be
called.Internally it is conical in form, and thrust through an external
hemispherical dome in a manner more clumsy and unpleasing than any other
example of its class.Externally, these defects are to some extent
atoned for by considerable richness and beauty of detail.It had
originally only one range of blind arcades, with three-quarter columns,
surmounted by an open arcade; an arrangement exactly similar to that of
the two lower storeys of the cathedral and the leaning tower (Woodcut
No.A considerable amount of pointed Gothic decoration was
afterwards added, which, though somewhat incongruous, is elegant in
itself, and hides to some extent the original defects of the design.But
the outline of the building and its whole arrangements are so radically
bad, that no amount of ornament can ever redeem them.Taken altogether, the Pisan baptistery is so very peculiar, that it
would be interesting if its design could be traced back to some
undoubted original.That this is possible will hardly be doubted by any
one at all familiar with the subject; meanwhile, the building most like
it that has been illustrated is the little church of San Donato, at
Zara.at the beginning of the 9th century, with materials taken
from ancient buildings, some of them of the best period of Roman
architecture.The two monolithic columns in front of the triple
sanctuary, and which are 30 ft.in height, bear testimony to the size
and importance of the temple they originally adorned, and the great
thickness of the walls and the size of the piers suggest a wealth of
material at the disposal of the builders.The rectangular building on
the south side Mr.Jackson considers to be coeval with the church; and
the chamber over it, which was on the same level and originally opened
on to the gallery round the aisles, formed a second church intended for
the use of the catechumens.The church is so built round that it is
impossible to say what its external appearance may have been.Both from
its resemblance to the Pisan baptistery and its own merits, it is an
interesting addition to our knowledge of those circular churches which
were such favourites with all the Christian architects in the
Carlovingian period.The resemblance in this instance is the more
remarkable, because the façade of the cathedral at Zara (Woodcut No.467) is in the Pisan style, only slightly modified by local
peculiarities.From what we already know, it seems undoubted that there
was a close connection—architecturally, at least—between Pisa and Zara.If this were fully investigated, it would probably throw considerable
light on the origin of the Pisan style, which has hitherto seemed so
exceptional in Italy, and also explain how the Byzantine element came to
be so strongly developed in what at first sight appears to be a
Romanesque style of art.Ground and Upper Storey of San Donato, Zara.The typical example of a tower in the Italian style is the celebrated
leaning tower at Pisa, partly seen in Woodcut No.It is, indeed, so
far as we at present know, the only one which carries out that
arrangement of numerous tiers of superimposed arcades which is so
characteristic of the style.The lower storey is well designed as a
solid basement for the superincumbent mass; its walls are 13 ft.in
thickness, and it is adorned with 15 three-quarter columns: its height
being 35 ft.The six storeys above this average 20 ft.in height, and
are each adorned with an open arcade.The whole is crowned by a smaller
circular tower, 27 ft.in height, in which the bells are hung.The
entire height is thus 182 ft.; the mean diameter of the main portion,
52.There is no doubt that it was originally intended to stand
perpendicular, though the contrary has been asserted; but before the
commencement of the fifth storey the foundations had given way, and the
attempts to readjust the work are plainly traceable in the upper
storeys, though without success.out of the
perpendicular,[309] which, though not sufficient to endanger its
stability, is enough to render it very unsightly.Even without this
defect, however, its design can hardly be commended; an arrangement of
six equal arcades, with horizontal entablatures, is not an expedient
mode of adorning a building, where elevation is the element of success.The introduction of strongly-marked vertical lines, or some variation in
the design of the arcades, would have greatly improved the design: and
so the Italians seem to have thought, for it was never repeated, and the
Pisan tower remains a solitary example of its class.Nothing at all resembling it occurs in the southern parts of the
province, though it must be admitted that they contain very few really
important towers of any sort.Perhaps the earthquakes to which a great portion of the country is
liable may have deterred the architects from indulging in structures of
great altitude; but it must be added that the idea of belfry or tower
did not enter into their municipal arrangements, and their towns are not
consequently illustrated by such towers as those of Venice, Cremona, or
Verona in the north.Of those which do exist that of Gaeta is perhaps as
picturesque as any.It was erected 1276-1290, and is both characteristic
of the style and elegant in outline.As will be observed, the lower
storey has pointed arches, while those above are all round; an
arrangement which, though to our eyes it may appear archæologically
wrong, is certainly constructively right, and the effect is very
pleasing, from the height and dignity given to the entrance.The two towers of the cathedral at Bari (Woodcut No.470) are not so
happy in design as this.They are too tall for their other dimensions,
and want accentuation throughout; while the change from the lower to the
upper storey is abrupt and ill-contrived.The tower at Caserta Vecchia
(Woodcut No.472) is low and squat in its proportions, and unfortunately
too typical of the towers in this land of earthquakes.As a rule, it may be asserted that the southern province of Italy is
singularly deficient in examples of civil or domestic architecture.Great monastic establishments existed there during the Middle Ages which
must have possessed buildings befitting their magnificence; but these
have either perished and been rebuilt, or have been so restored that
their original forms can hardly be recognised.There are, indeed,
cloisters at Amalfi and Sorrento; much more remarkable, however, for the
beauty of their situation than for their architecture, which is
extremely rude and clumsy.There are no chapter-houses: no halls or
conventual buildings of any sort.In this respect, the province forms a
remarkable contrast with Spain in the same age; though it must be
confessed that the North of Italy is also very deficient in conventual
buildings of the Middle Ages, the most magnificent and beautiful
belonging more to the Renaissance than to the Mediæval period.At Ravello there is the Casa Ruffolo, a picturesque palace of the 13th
century, still nearly entire: a strange mixture of Gothic and Saracenic
taste, but so exceptional, that it would not be fair to quote it as a
type of any style.It seems to owe its peculiarities more to the taste
of some individual patron or architect rather than to any national taste
or form of design.There are, however, several Hohenstauffen castles of tolerable
preservation, more or less typical of the domestic arts of the day in
which they were erected.One of the best preserved of these is that of
Castel del Monte, erected by Frederick II., 1240-44.It is an octagon in
plan, with octagonal turrets at each angle.across
its extreme breadth, and surrounds a courtyard 57 ft.Both
storeys are vaulted, and all the details throughout are good and
pleasing.The whole is an admixture of Italian taste, superimposed on a
German design; but it will be observed how little removed the
architectural details of the entrance are, even at that early age, from
the style of the Renaissance.This is, indeed, the great characteristic
of the architectural objects in Southern Italy.Though they adopted
Christian forms, they never abandoned the classical feeling in details;
and it is this which mainly renders them worthy of study.Whether
considered in regard to dimensions, outline, or constructive
peculiarities, their churches will not bear a moment’s comparison with
those of the North; but in elegance of detail they often surpass purely
Gothic buildings to such a degree as to become to some extent as worthy
of study as their more ambitious rivals.Part Section, part Elevation, of Castel del Monte.POINTED ITALIAN GOTHIC.Fresco paintings—Churches at Vercelli, Asti, Verona, and Lucca—Cathedral

Before the commencement of the 13th century, the Italians had acquired
such mastery over the details of their round-arched style, and had
worked it into such originality and completeness, that it is surprising
that they should so easily have abandoned it for that form of Pointed
Gothic which they afterwards adopted.It is true the Italians never rose
to the conception of such buildings as the great Rhenish cathedrals,
like those of Spires and Worms, or the old churches at Cologne; nor did
they perhaps even rival the quasi-classical grace and elegance of the
Provençal churches; but at Verona, Modena, and indeed throughout the
North of Italy, they had elaborated a complete round-arched style, all
the details of which were not only appropriate and elegant, but seemed
capable of indefinite development in the direction in which they were
proceeding.They had also before their eyes the Romanesque style of Pisa
and Lucca with all its elegance, and the example of Rome, where the
architects steadily refused to acknowledge the pointed arch during the
whole of the Mediæval period.Yet in the beginning of the 13th
century—say 1220, when the cathedrals of Amiens, Salisbury, and Toledo
were designed—Italy too was smitten with admiration for the pointed
arch, and set to work to adapt it to her tastes and uses.It would be difficult to account for this, were we not aware how deeply
the feelings that gave rise to the Ghibelline faction were rooted in the
Italian soil.In all the cities, except Rome, the cause of the
Ghibellines was throughout the Middle Ages identified with that of
freedom and local independence, in opposition to that of the Guelfs,
which symbolised the supremacy of the Pope and the clerical party.Knowing how strenuously this was resisted, we naturally expect to find
it expressed in the architecture of the country.Two, indeed, of the
great churches of Italy, Assisi (1228) and Milan (1385), were erected by
Germans in the German style of the day; but these are exceptional.The
form which the pointed-arched style took on its introduction, was that
of adaptation to the Italian style, in a manner which the Italians
thought more consonant with beauty and convenience than that adopted
north of the Alps.The elegance of
the details employed by a refined and cultivated people, and based on
classical traditions, goes far to redeem, in most instances, the defects
of their designs; but they never grasped the true principles of Gothic
art, and the fatal facility of the pointed arch led them more astray
after mechanical clevernesses than even the Germans.Still, it is an
original style, and, however imperfect, is well worthy of study.Before proceeding to describe the style more in detail, it may be well
to point out one of the principal causes which led to the more marked
features of difference between the Gothic architecture of Italy and that
of Germany and France.This was the distaste of the Italians for the
employment of painted glass, or at least their want of appreciation of
its beauties when combined with architecture.It will be explained in a future chapter how all-important painted glass
was to the elaboration of the Gothic style.But for its introduction,
the architecture of France would bear no resemblance to what it was, and
is.In Italy, indeed, the people loved polychromy, but always of the
opaque class.They delighted to cover the walls of their churches with
frescoes and mosaics, to enrich their floors with the most gorgeous
pavements, and to scatter golden stars over the blue ground of their
vaults; but rarely, if ever, did they fill, or design to fill, their
windows with painted glass.Perhaps the glare of an Italian sun may have
tended to render its brilliancy intolerable; but more probably the
absence of stained glass is owing to its incompatibility with
fresco-painting, the effect of which would be entirely destroyed by the
superior brightness of the transparent material.The Italians were not
prepared to relinquish the old and favourite mode of decoration in which
they so excelled.This adherence to the ancient method of ornamentation
enabled them, in the 15th and 16th centuries, to surpass all the world
in the art of painting, but it was fatal to the proper appreciation of
the pointed style, and to its successful introduction into the land.The first effect of this tendency was that the windows in Italian
churches were small, and generally devoid of tracery, with all its
beautiful accompaniments.The walls, too, being consequently solid, were
sufficient, by their own weight, to abut the thrust of the arches: so
that neither projecting or flying buttresses nor pinnacles were needed.The buildings were thus deprived externally of all the aspiring vertical
lines so characteristic of true Gothic.The architects, to relieve the
monotony arising from the want of these features, were forced to recur
to the horizontal cornices of the classical times, and to cover their
walls with a series of panelling which, however beautiful in itself, is
mere ornament—both unmeaning and inconsistent.Internally, too, having no clerestory to make room for, and no
constructive necessities to meet, they jumped to the conclusion that the
best design is that which covers the greatest space with the least
expenditure of materials, and the least encumbrance of the floor.With
builders this is a golden rule, but with architects it is about the
worst that can possibly be adopted.The Germans were not free from this
fault, but the Italians carried it still further.If on four or five
piers they could support the vault of a whole nave, they never dreamed
of introducing more.A French architect, though superior in constructive
skill, would probably have introduced eight or ten in the same space.An
Italian aimed at carrying the vaults of the side-aisles to the same
height as that of the nave, if he could.A Northern architect knew how
to keep the two in their due proportion, whereby he obtained greater
height and greater width in the same bulk, and an appearance of height
and width greater still, by the contrast between the parts, at the same
time that he gave his building a character of strength and stability
perhaps even more valuable than that of size.In the same manner the Northern architects, while they grouped their
shafts together, kept them so distinct as to allow every one to bear its
proportional part of the load, and perform its allotted task.The
Italians never comprehended this principle, but merely stuck pilasters
back to back, in imitation of the true architects, producing an
unmeaning and ugly pier.The same incongruities occur in every part and
every detail.It is a style copied without understanding, and executed
without feeling.The elegance of the sculptured foliage and other
details sometimes goes far to redeem these faults; for the Italians,
though bad architects, were always beautiful carvers, and, as a Southern
people, were free from the vulgarities sometimes apparent farther north,
and never fell into the wild barbarisms which too often disfigure even
the best buildings on this side of the Alps.Besides, when painting is
joined to sculpture in churches, the architecture may come to occupy a
subordinate position, and thus escape the censure it deserves.Unfortunately there are only two examples of any importance in this
style that retain all their painted decorations—St.Francis at Assisi,
and the Certosa near Pavia.From this circumstance they are perhaps the
most admired in Italy.In others the spaces left for colour are still
plain and blank.We see the work of the architect unaided by the
painting which was intended to set it off, and we cannot but condemn it
as displaying at once bad taste and ignorance of the true Gothic
feeling.One of the earliest, or perhaps the very first Italian edifice into
which the pointed arch was introduced, is the fine church of St.Andrea
at Vercelli, commenced in the year 1219 by the Cardinal Guala Bicchieri,
and finished in three years.This prelate, having been long legate in
England, brought back with him an English architect called, it is said,
Brigwithe, and entrusted him with the erection of this church in his
native place.(From Osten’s
‘Baukunst in Lombardei.’) Scale 100 ft.In plan, it is certainly very like an English church, terminating
squarely towards the east, and with side chapels to the transepts,
arranged very much as we find them at Buildwas, Kirkstall, and other
churches of this class and size, only that here they are polygonal,
which was hardly ever the case in England.But with the plan all
influences of the English architect seem to have ceased, and the
structure is in purely Italian style.Externally the pointed arch
nowhere appears, all the doors and windows being circular-headed; while
internally it is confined to the pier-arches of the nave and the
vaulting of the roof.The façade is flanked at its angles by two tall,
slender, square towers; and the intersection of the nave and transept is
covered by one of those elegant octagonal domes which the Italians knew
so well how to use, and which is in fact the only original feature in
their designs.The external form of this church is interesting, as
displaying the germs of much that two centuries afterwards was so
greatly expanded by a German architect in the design of Milan cathedral.A few years later, in 1229, a church was commenced at Asti, the tower of
which was finished in 1266.This allowed time for a more complete
development of the pointed style, which here prevails not only
internally, but externally.Tall pointed windows appear in the flanks,
and even the doorways assume that form, in their canopies, if not in
their openings.493) is a later addition, and a
characteristic specimen of the style during the 14th century.This
church is also one of the earliest examples in which those elegant
terra-cotta cornices of small intersecting arches seem to have been
brought to perfection.(From Chapuy, ‘Moyen-Âge
Monumental.’)]

The most remarkable church of this age is that of St.Francis at Assisi,
commenced in 1228, and finished, in all essentials at least, in 1253.It
is said to have been built by a German named Jacob, or Jacopo.Certainly
no French or English architect would have designed a double church of
this class, though, on the other hand, no Italian could have drawn
details so purely Northern as those of the upper church.In the lower
church there are hardly any mouldings to mark the style, but its
character is certainly rather German than Italian.This church depends
for its magnificence and character much more on painting than on
architecture.In the first place it is small, the upper church being
only 225 ft.width; and though the lower one has
side-aisles which extend the width to 100 ft., yet the upper church is
only 60 ft.in height, and the lower about 30, so that it is far too
small for much architectural magnificence.None of its details are equal
to those of contemporary churches on this side of the Alps.The whole
church is covered with fresco paintings in great variety and of the most
beautiful character, which justly render it one of the most celebrated
and admired of all Italy.On this side of the Alps without its frescoes,
it would hardly attract any attention.It is invaluable as an example of
the extent to which the polychromatic decoration may be profitably
carried, and of the true mode of doing it; and also as an illustration
of the extent to which the Italians allowed a foreign style and mode of
ornamentation to be introduced into their country.One of the purest and most perfect types of an Italian Gothic church is
that of Sta.Anastasia at Verona, commenced apparently in 1260.It is
not large, being only 285 ft.in length externally; but its arrangements
are very complete, and very perfect if looked at from an Italian point
of view.The square of the vault of the nave is the modulus, instead of
that of the aisles, as in true Gothic churches: owing to which the
pier-arches are further apart than a true artist would have placed them;
there are also no buttresses externally, but only pilasters.The
consequence of this is, that the arches have to be tied in with iron
rods at the springing, which internally adds very much to the appearance
of weakness, caused in the first instance by the wide spacing and
general tenuity.These bad effects are aggravated by the absence of a
string-course at the springing of the vault; and by the substitution of
a circular hole for the triforium, and a hexafoiled opening of very
insignificant dimensions for the glorious clerestory windows of Northern
churches.Altogether, though we cannot help being pleased with the
spaciousness and general elegance of design, it is impossible not to
feel how very inferior it is to that of churches on this side the Alps.One Bay, externally and internally, of the Church of
San Martino, Lucca.]The church of San Martino at Lucca, built about a century after Sta.Anastasia (middle of 14th century), presents a strikingly happy
compromise between the two styles.The pier-arches are still too wide—23
ft.in the clear; but the defect is remedied to some extent by the
employment of circular instead of pointed arches, and the triforium is
all that can be desired; the clerestory, however, is as insignificant as
it must be where the sun is so brilliant and painted glass inadmissible.It would be easy to point out other defects; but, taking it altogether,
there are few more elegant churches than this, and hardly one in Italy
that so perfectly meets all the exigencies for which it was designed.(From the ‘Églises
principales d’Europe.’) Scale 100 ft.The cathedrals of Siena and Orvieto (the former commenced in 1243, the
latter in 1290) are perhaps, taken altogether, the most successful
specimens of Italian pointed Gothic.They are those at least in which
the system is carried to the greatest extent without either foreign aid
or the application of distinctly foreign details.These two buildings,
moreover, both retain their façades as completed by their first
architects, while the three great churches of this style—the cathedrals
of Florence, Bologna, and Milan—were in this respect left unfinished,
with many others of the smaller churches of Italy.The church at Siena
illustrates forcibly the tendency of the Italian architects to adhere to
the domical forms of the old Etruscans, which the Romans amplified to
such an extent, and the Byzantines made peculiarly their own.I cannot
but repeat my regret that the Italians alone, of all the Western
Mediæval builders, showed any predilection for this form of roof.On
this side of the Alps it could have been made the most beautiful of
architectural forms.In Italy there is no instance of more than moderate
success—nothing, indeed, to encourage imitation.Even the example now
before us is no exception to these remarks, though one of the boldest
efforts of Italian architects.In plan it ought to have been an octagon,
but that apparently would have made it too large for their skill to
execute, so they met the difficulty by adopting a hexagon, which, though
producing a certain variety of perspective, fits awkwardly with the
lines of columns, and twists the vaults to an unpleasant extent.Still,
a dome of moderate height, and 58 ft.in diameter, covering the centre
of the church, and with sufficient space around to give it dignity, is a
noble and pleasing feature, the merit of which it is impossible to deny.Combined with the rich colouring and gorgeous furniture of the church,
it makes up a whole of great beauty.The circular pier-arches, however,
and the black and white stripes by which the exterior is marked, detract
considerably from the effect of the whole—at least in the eyes of
strangers, though the Italians still consider it a beauty.The façade of
this cathedral is represented in Woodcut No.It consists of three
great portals, the arches of which are equal in size, though the centre
doorway is larger than those at the sides.Above is the invariable
circular window of the Italian architects, and the whole is crowned by
steep triangular gables.Beneath the cathedral, or rather under the
choir, is the ancient baptistery, now the church of St.John the
Baptist; its front is in a much purer style of Gothic than the
cathedral.[310]

[Illustration: 498.Façade of the Cathedral at Siena.]The carved architectural ornaments of the façade are rich and elaborate
in the extreme, though figured sculpture is used to a much less extent
than in Northern portals of the same age.It is also observable that the
strong horizontal lines do not harmonise with the aspiring character of
pointed architecture.The cathedral of Orvieto is smaller and simpler, and less rich in its
decorations, than that at Siena, with the exception of its façade, which
is adorned with sculpture and painting.Indeed the three-gabled front
may be considered the typical one for churches of this class.The
façades intended to have been applied to the churches at Florence,
Bologna, Milan, and elsewhere, were no doubt very similar to that
represented in Woodcut No.As a frontispiece, if elaborately
sculptured and painted, it is not without considerable appropriateness
and even beauty; but, as an architectural object, it is infinitely
inferior to the double-towered façades of the Northern cathedrals, or
even to those with only one great tower in the centre.It has besides
the defect of not expressing what is behind it; the central gable being
always higher than the roof, and the two others merely ornamental
appendages.Indeed, like the Italian Gothic buildings generally, it
depended on painting, sculpture, and carving for its effect, far more
than on architectural design properly so called.Among the greatest and most complete examples of Italian Gothic is the
church of Sta.Maria dei Fiori, the cathedral of Florence, one of the
largest and finest churches produced in the Middle Ages—as far as mere
grandeur of conception goes, perhaps the very best, though considerably
marred in execution from defects of style, which are too apparent in
every part.(From Isabelle,
‘Édifices Circulaires.’) Scale 100 ft.The building of the church was commenced in the year 1294 or 1298 (it is
not quite clear which), from the designs and under the superintendence
of Arnolfo di Lapo, for unfortunately in this style we know the names of
all the architects, and all the churches show traces of the caprice and
of the misdirected efforts of individuals, instead of the combined
national movement which produced such splendid results in France and
England.It is not known how far Arnolfo had carried the building when
he died, in 1310, but probably up to the springing of the vaults.After
this the works proceeded more leisurely, but the nave and smaller domes
of the choir were no doubt completed as we now find them in the first
twenty years of the 14th century.The great octagon remained unfinished,
and, if covered in at all, it was only by a wooden roof of domical
outline externally, which seems to be that represented in the fresco in
the convent of San Marco, till Brunelleschi commenced the present dome
in 1420, and completed it in all essential parts before his death, which
happened in 1444.The building may therefore be considered as
essentially contemporary with the cathedral of Cologne, which it very
nearly equals in size (its area being 84,802 ft., while that of Cologne
is estimated at 91,000), and, as far as mere conception of plan goes,
there can be little doubt but that the Florentine cathedral far
surpasses its German rival.Nothing indeed can be finer than its general
ground-plan.A vast nave leads to an enormous dome, extending into the
triapsal arrangement so common in the early churches of Cologne, and
which was repeated in the last and greatest effort of the Middle Ages,
or rather the first of the new school—the great church of St.In the Florentine church all these parts are better subordinated
and proportioned than in any other example, and the mode in which the
effect increases and the whole expands as we approach from the entrance
to the sanctum is unrivalled.Like all inexperienced architects, Arnolfo seems to have
thought that largeness of parts would add to the greatness of the whole,
and thus used only four great arches in the whole length of his nave,
giving the central aisle a width of 55 ft.of that of Cologne, and the height about the same; and
yet, in appearance, the height is about half, and the breadth less than
half, owing to the better proportion of the parts and to the superior
appropriateness in the details on the part of the German cathedral.At
Florence the details are positively ugly.The windows of the side-aisles
are small and misplaced, those of the clerestory mere circular holes.The proportion of the aisles one to another is bad, the vaults
ill-formed, and altogether a colder and less effective design was not
produced in the Middle Ages.The triapsal choir is not so objectionable
as the nave, but there are large plain spaces that now look cold and
flat; the windows are too few and small, and there is a gloom about the
whole which is very unsatisfactory.It is nearly certain that the
original intention was to paint the walls, and not to colour the
windows, so that these defects are hardly chargeable to the original
design, and would not be apparent now were it not that in a moment of
mistaken enthusiasm the Florentines were seized with a desire to imitate
the true style of Gothic art, and rival Northern cathedrals in the glory
of their painted glass.This, in a church whose windows were designed
only of such dimensions as were sufficient to admit the requisite
quantity of white light, was fatal.Notwithstanding the beauty of the
glass itself, which seems to have been executed at Lubeck, 1434, from
Italian designs, it is so completely out of place that it only produces
irritation instead of admiration, and has certainly utterly destroyed
the effect and meaning of the interior it was intended to adorn.Section of Dome and part of Nave of the Cathedral at
Florence.Part of the Flank of Cathedral at Florence.]Dome at Chiaravalle, near Milan.Externally the façade was never finished,[311] and we can only fancy
what was intended from the analogy of Siena and Orvieto.The flanks of
the nave are without buttresses or pinnacles, and, with only a few
insignificant windows, would be painfully flat except for a veneer of
 marbles disposed in panels over the whole surface.For an
interior or a pavement such a mode of decoration is admissible; but it
is so unconstructive, so evidently a mere decoration, that it gives a
weakness to the whole, and most unsatisfactory appearance to so large a
building.This is much less apparent at the east end, where the outline
is so broken, and the main lines of the construction so plainly marked,
that the mere filling in is comparatively unimportant.This is the most
meritorious part of the church, and, so far as it was carried up
according to the original design, is extremely beautiful.Even the
plainness and flatness of the nave serve as a foil to set off the
varying outline of the choir.Above the line of the cornice of the
side-aisles there is nothing that can be said to belong to the original
design except the first division of the drum of the dome, which follows
the lines of the clerestory.It has long been a question what Arnolfo
originally intended, and especially how he meant to cover the great
octagonal space in the centre.All knowledge of his intentions seems to
have been lost within a century after his death: at least, in the
accounts of the proceedings of the commission which resulted in the
adoption of Brunelleschi’s design for the dome, no reference is made to
any original design as then existing, and no one appears to have known
how Arnolfo intended to finish his work.Judging from the structure as
far as he carried it, and with the knowledge we now possess of the
Italian architecture of that age, we can easily conjecture what his
design for its completion may have been.Internally, it probably
consisted of a dome something like the present, but flatter, springing
from the cornice, 40 ft.lower than the present one, and pierced with
large openings on each of its eight faces.Section of Eastern portion of Church at Chiaravalle.(From Gruner’s ‘Terra Cotta Architecture in Italy.’) Scale 50 ft.Externally, two courses were open to him.The first and most obvious was
to hide the dome entirely under a wooden roof, as is done in St.George’s, Thessalonica (Woodcut No.305), or in the baptistery in front
of the cathedral, and is done in half the baptisteries in Italy—as at
Parma, for instance (Woodcut No.Had he done this, the span of the
dome might have been very much larger, without involving any
constructive difficulties, and the three towers over the choir and
transepts might have sufficed to relieve its external appearance
sufficiently for architectural effect.On the whole, however, I am
rather inclined to believe that something more ambitious than this was
originally proposed, and that the design was more like that of
Chiaravalle near Milan, built in 1221, and one of the most complete and
perfect of this class of dome now existing in Italy.Its external
appearance may be judged of from Woodcut 502, and its constructive
details from the section, Woodcut No.If the basement is sufficiently solid—and that at Florence is more than
sufficient for any superstructure of the sort—it is evident the
architect can dispose of such masses of masonry, that he can counteract
any thrust or tendency to spread that can exist in any dome of this
sort; and instead of being only 136 ft.across, 150 or 160 might easily
have been attempted.Instead of 375 ft., which is the height of the
present dome from the floor to the top of the cross externally, it might
even with the present diameter have been carried up to at least 500 ft.,
or as high as the church was long,—70 to 100 ft.Had this been done, the three smaller semi-domes must have been intended
to be crowned with miniature octagonal spires of the same class with the
great dome, and between these the vast substructures show that it was
intended to carry up four great spires, probably to a height of 400 ft.Had all this been done (and something very like it seems certainly to
have been intended), neither Cologne Cathedral, nor any church in
Europe, ancient or modern, would have been comparable to this great and
glorious apse.As it is, the plain, heavy, simple outlined dome of
Brunelleschi acts like an extinguisher, crushing all the lower part of
the composition, and both internally and externally destroying all
harmony between the parts.It has deprived us of the only chance that
ever existed of witnessing the effect of a great Gothic dome; not indeed
such a dome as might with the same dimensions have been executed on this
side of the Alps, but still in the spirit, and with much of the poetry,
which gives such value to the conceptions of the builders in those days.But for this change of plan, the ambition of the Florentines might have
been in some measure satisfied, whose instructions to the architect
were, that their cathedral “should surpass everything that human
industry or human power had conceived of great and beautiful.”

About a century later (1390), the Bolognese determined on the erection
of a monster cathedral, which, in so far as size went, would have been
more than double that at Florence.According to the plans that have come
down to us, it was to have been about 800 ft.long and 525 wide across
the transepts; at the intersection was to have been a dome 130 ft.in
diameter, or only 6 ft.less than that at Florence; and the width of
both nave and transepts was to have been 183 ft.: so that the whole
would have covered about 212,000 ft., or nearly the same area as St.Peter’s at Rome, and three times that of any French cathedral!Of this
vast design, only about one-third (Woodcut No.ft., was
ever carried out; but that fragment is quite sufficient to enable us to
judge of the merits or defects of this style in its state of greatest
perfection.The only other building in the same style on a sufficient
scale to admit of comparison with this is the nave of the cathedral at
Florence just described, but that is nearly as may be only half of its
dimensions, or 36,000 ft.The chapels, too, at
Bologna add practically a fifth aisle, giving great variety and richness
to the perspective.The varied heights and proportions of the central
and side aisles are singularly pleasing, and there being six arches at
Bologna instead of only four as at Florence, and twelve side chapels
where none exist in the other example, go far to redeem the lean
mechanical look which is the great defect of this style.The great
advantage San Petronio has over the Florentine church is in the size and
number of its windows, and these not being filled with stained glass the
whole church has a bright and pleasing effect that contrasts most
favourably with the gloom of its great rival.Notwithstanding this, the
nave of San Petronio cannot be considered as a successful work of art.In the first place it is too mechanically perfect.The area of the
points of support as compared with the voids is, as far as can be made
out from such plans as exist, about one-twelfth, which would be a merit
in a railway station, but something more is wanted in a monumental
building.In the next there is a singular deficiency of either
constructive or constructed ornament.On this side of the Alps an
architect with vaulting shafts, string-courses, galleries, and fifty
other expedients, would have relieved the bareness of the walls.At
Bologna it probably was intended they should be painted, and this never
having been executed may account for most of its apparent defects.In Gothic architecture one of two systems seems indispensable: either
painted glass with strongly-marked carved mouldings over the whole of
the interior, or white glass with flat surfaces suitable for opaque
paintings.Few cathedrals are complete in both respects at the present
day, but in their imperfect state the Northern system has an immense
advantage over the Southern.The architecture of our cathedrals is
complete and beautiful even in ruins.An Italian church without its
 decoration is only a framed canvas without harmony or meaning.Were San Petronio as complete in its  decoration as the Certosa
at Pavia or Monreale at Palermo, it might stand a fair competition with
the best interiors on this side of the Alps.As it is, it is only a
splendid example of ornamental but unornamented construction, and, as
was attempted to be explained in the Introduction, both elements are
wanted for success in architectural design.Section of San Petronio, Bologna.The exterior of the church is in too unfinished a state to enable us to
judge of what its effect might have been if completed, but many of its
details, especially of the façade, are of very great beauty, in many
respects superior to what is to be found on this side of the Alps.Its
central dome, however, never could have been a feature worthy of so vast
a church.In diameter it is equal, or nearly so, to that of Florence,
but the points of support are so small, and so far apart, that it must
have been mainly if not wholly of wood.No such towering structure as
Arnolfo’s vast substructures show that he intended, could have stood on
the slim supports of the Bolognese church.[312]

[Illustration: 506.(From ‘Chiesi
Principali d’Europa.’) Scale 100 ft.The cathedral of Milan—at once the most remarkable and one of the
largest and richest of all the churches erected in the Middle Ages—was
commenced in the year 1385, by order of Gian Galeazzo, first Duke of
Milan, and consecrated in 1418, at which date all the essential parts
seem to have been completed, though the central spire was not finished
till about the year 1440, by Brunelleschi.The design is said to have been furnished by a German architect,
Heinrich Arlez von Gemunden, or as the Italians call him, “da
Gamondia,”—a statement which is corroborated by the fact that the
details and many of the forms are essentially Northern; but it is
equally certain that he was not allowed to control the whole, for all
the great features of the church are as thoroughly Italian as the
details are German: it is therefore by no means improbable that Marco da
Campione, as the Italians assert, or some other native artist, was
joined with him or placed over him.In size it is, except Seville, the largest of all Mediæval cathedrals,
covering 107,782 ft.In material it is the richest, being built wholly
of white marble, which is scarcely the case with any other church, large
or small; and in decoration it is the most gorgeous—the whole of the
exterior is covered with tracery, and the amount of carving and statuary
lavished on its pinnacles and spires is unrivalled in any other building
of Europe.It is also built wholly (with the exception of the façade)
according to one design.Yet, with all these advantages, the appearance
of this wonderful building is not satisfactory to any one who is
familiar with the great edifices on this side of the Alps.Cologne is
certainly more beautiful; Rheims, Chartres, Amiens, and Bourges leave a
far more satisfactory impression on the mind; and even the much smaller
church of St.Ouen will convey far more pleasure to the true artist than
this gorgeous temple.The cause of all this it is easy to understand, since all or nearly all
its defects arise from the introduction of Italian features into a
Gothic building; or rather, perhaps, it should be said, from a German
architect being allowed to ornament an Italian cathedral.Petronio at Bologna as our standard of
comparison, it will be seen that the sections (Woodcuts Nos.505, 507)
are almost identical both in dimensions and in form, except that at
Milan the external range is a real aisle instead of a series of side
chapels; but, at the same time, it will be perceived that the German
system prevailed in doubling the number of the piers between the nave
and side-aisles.So far, therefore, the German architect saved the
church.The two small clerestories, however, still remain; and although
the design avoids the mullionless little circles of Bologna, there is
only space for small openings, which more resemble the windows of an
attic than of a clerestory.The greater quantity of light being thus
introduced by the tall windows of the outer aisle, the appearance is
that of a building lighted from below, which is fatal to architectural
effect.The model still preserved on the spot shows that the German architect
designed great portals at each end of the transepts.This, however, was
overruled in favour of two small polygonal apses.Instead of the great
octagonal dome which an Italian would have placed upon the intersection
of the whole width of the nave and transepts, German influence has
confined it to the central aisle, which is perhaps more to be regretted
than any other mistake in the building.The choir is neither a French
chevet nor a German or Italian apse, but a compromise between the two, a
French circlet of columns enclosed in a German polygonal termination.This part of the building, with its simple forms and three glorious
windows, is perhaps an improvement on either of the models of which it
is compounded.[313] (From
Wiebeking.)This is the nearest approach to the French chevet arrangement to be
found in all Italy.It is extremely rare in that country to find an
aisle running round the choir, and opening into it, or with the circlet
of apsidal chapels which is so universal in France.The Italian church
is not, in fact, derived from a combination of a circular Eastern church
with a Western rectangular nave, but is a direct copy from the old Roman
basilica.The details of the interior of Milan cathedral are almost wholly German
(Woodcut No.The great capitals of the pillars, with their niches
and statues, are the only compromise between the ordinary German form
and the great deep ugly capitals—fragments, in fact, of classical
entablatures—which disfigure the cathedrals of Florence and Bologna, and
so many other Italian churches.Had the ornamentation of these been
carried up to the springing of the vault, they would have been
unexceptionable; as it is, with all their richness, their effect is
unmeaning.Externally, the appearance is in outline not unlike that of Sta.Maria
dei Fiori; the apse is rich, varied, and picturesque, and the central
dome (excepting the details) similar, though on a smaller scale, to what
I believe to have been the original design of the Florentine church.The
nave is nearly as flat as at Florence, the clerestory not being visible;
but the forest of pinnacles and flying buttresses and the richness of
the ornamentation go far to hide that defect.The façade was left
unfinished, as was so often the case with the great churches of Italy.Pellegrini was afterwards employed to finish it, and a model of his
design is still preserved.It is fortunate that his plan was not carried
out.The façade was finished, as we now see it, from the designs of
Amati, by order of Napoleon.It is commonplace, as might be expected
from its age, but inoffensive.The doorways are part of Pellegrini’s
design, and the Mediæval forms being placed over those of the
cinque-cento, produce a strangely incongruous effect.For the west front
several original designs are still preserved.One of these, with two
small square towers at the angles, as at Vercelli and elsewhere, was no
doubt the Italian design.509) is preserved
by Bassi:[314] had this been executed, the façade would have been about
one-third (viz.Had the height of
the towers been in the same proportion, they would have been the tallest
in the world.In that case the effect here, as at Cologne, would have
been to shorten and overpower the rest of the building to a painful
extent.A design midway between the two, with spires rising to the same
height as the central one, or about 360 ft., would perhaps have the
happiest effect.At any rate, the want of some such features is greatly
felt in the building as it stands.The Certosa, near Pavia, was commenced about the same date (1396) as the
cathedral at Milan.It is seldom that we find two buildings in the
Middle Ages so close to one another in date and locality, and yet so
dissimilar.There is no instance of such an occurrence on this side of
the Alps, till modern times; and it shows that in those days the
Italians were nearly as devoid of any distinct principles of
architecture as we have since become.View of the Certosa, near Pavia.The great difference between Pavia and Milan is that the former shows no
trace of foreign influence.Petronio, and
by no means so complete or consistent in design.Nothing, in fact, can
be more painful than the disproportion of the parts, the bad drawing of
the details, the malformation of the vaults, and the meanness of the
windows; though all these defects are completely hidden by the most
gorgeous colouring, and by furniture of such richness as to be almost
unrivalled.So attractive are these two features to the majority of
spectators, and so easily understood, that nine visitors out of ten are
delighted with the Certosa, and entirely forget its miserable
architecture in the richness and brilliancy of its decorations.Externally the architecture is better than in the interior.From its
proximity to Pavia, it retains its beautiful old galleries under the
roof.Its circular apses, with their galleries, give to this church, for
the age to which it belongs, a peculiar character, harmonising well with
the circular-headed form, which nearly all the windows and openings
present.Even in the interior there are far more circular than pointed
arches.The most beautiful and wonderful part of the building is the façade.This was begun in 1473, and is one of the best specimens in Italy of the
Renaissance style.It would hardly, therefore, be appropriate to mention
it here, were it not that the dome over the intersection of the nave and
transepts is of the same age and style, but reproduces so exactly
(except in details) what we fancy the Mediæval Italian Gothic dome to
have been, that it may be considered as a feature of the earlier ages.502, it will be seen how like it is to that of
Chiaravalle in outline.It is less tall, however, and, if translated
into the details of the great church at Florence, would fit perfectly on
the basement there prepared for such a feature.Like many other churches in Northern Italy, the principal parts of the
Certosa are built in brick, and the ornamental details executed in
terra-cotta.Some of the latter, especially in the cloisters, are as
beautiful as any executed in stone in any part of Italy during the
Middle Ages; and their perfect preservation shows how suitable is the
material for such purposes.It may not be appropriate for large details
or monumental purposes, but for the minor parts and smaller details,
when used as the Italians in the Middle Ages used it, terra-cotta is as
legitimate as any material anywhere used for building purposes; and in
situations like the alluvial plains of the Po, where stone is with
difficulty obtainable, its employment was not only judicious but most
fortunate in its results.It would be a tedious and unprofitable task to attempt to particularise
all the churches which were erected in this style in Italy, as hardly
one of them possesses a single title to admiration beyond the very
vulgar one of size.To this Santa Croce, at Florence, adds its
association with the great men who lie buried beneath it, and Sta.Maria
Novella can plead the circumstance—exceptional in that city—of
possessing a façade;[315] but neither of these has anything to redeem
its innate ugliness in the eyes of an architect.There are two great churches of this period at Venice, the San Giovanni
e Paolo (1246-1420) and the Frari (1250); they are large and richly
ornamented fabrics, but are both entirely destitute of architectural
merit.(From Hope’s ‘Architecture.’)
Scale 50 ft.A much more beautiful building is the cathedral at Como, the details of
which are so elegant and so unobtrusively used as in great measure to
make up for the bad arrangement and awkward form of the whole.In design
it is, however, inferior to that of the Duomo at Ferrara (Woodcut No.The latter does not display the richness of the façades of Siena
or Orvieto, nor the elegance of that last named; but among the few
Italian façades which exist, it stands pre-eminent for sober propriety
of design and the good proportions of all its parts.The repose caused
by the solidity of the lower portions, and the gradual increase of
ornament and lightness as we ascend, all combine to render it harmonious
and pleasing.It is true it wants the aspiring character and bold relief
of Northern façades; but these do not belong to the style, and it must
suffice if we meet in this style with a moderate amount of variety,
undisturbed by any very prominent instances of bad taste.The true type of an Italian façade is well illustrated in the view of
St.Francesco at Brescia (Woodcut No.512), which may be considered the
germ of all that followed.Whether the church had three aisles or five,
the true Italian façade in the age of pointed architecture was always a
modification or extension of this idea, though introduced with more or
less Gothic feeling according to the circumstances of its erection.At Florence there is a house or warehouse, converted into a church,—Or
(horreum) San Michele, which has attracted a good deal of attention, but
more on account of its curious ornaments than for beauty of design—which
latter it does not, and indeed can hardly be expected to, possess.Maria della Spina at Pisa owes its celebrity to
the richness of its niches and canopies, and to the sculpture which they
contain.In this the Italians were always at home, and probably always
surpassed the Northern nations.It was far otherwise with architecture,
properly so called.This, in the age of the pointed style, was in Italy
so cold and unmeaning, that we do not wonder at the readiness with which
the Italians returned to the classical models.They are to be forgiven
in this, but we cannot so easily forgive _our_ forefathers, who
abandoned a style far more beautiful than that of Italy to copy one
which they had themselves infinitely surpassed; and this only because
the Italians, unable either to comSprehend or imitate the true
principles of pointed art, were forced to abandon its practice.Unfortunately for us, they had in this respect in that age sufficient
influence to set the fashion to all Europe.(From Street’s
‘Brick and Marble in the Middle Ages.’)]

Of late work in Dalmatia the most remarkable is the Cathedral of
Sebenico (described in Mr.Jackson’s work), built entirely in stone and
marble, and without any brick or timber in its construction.It is a
cruciform building, covered over by a waggon-vault of stone, visible
both inside and outside.It was commenced from the design of Messer
Ambrosia, a Venetian architect, in 1435, to whom may be attributed the
nave and aisles up to the string-course above nave arches.The work was
continued after 1441 by another architect, Messer Giorgio, also from
Venice, who died in 1475, leaving the building still incomplete.The
style of the work is late Venetian Gothic, influenced in its later
portions by the Renaissance revival.The cloisters of the Badia at
Curzola, and of the Dominican and Franciscan convents at Ragusa, are
also beautiful specimens of late Italian Gothic.----------------------------

  It may be suggested that the glory of a French clerestory filled with
  stained glass made up for all these defects, and it may be true that

  Max Müller, who is the _facile princeps_ of the linguistic school in
  this country—in an inaugural lecture which he delivered when, it was
  understood, he was appointed to a chair in the Strasburg
  University—gave up all that has hitherto been contended for by his
  followers.He admitted that language, though an invaluable aid, did
  not suffice for the purposes of the investigation, and that the
  results obtained by its means were not always to be depended upon.Footnote 17:

  The term “Persistent Varieties” has recently been introduced, instead
  of “race,” in ethnological nomenclature, and, if scientific accuracy
  is aimed at, is no doubt an improvement.It is an advantage to have a
  term which does not even in appearance prejudge any of the questions
  between the monogenists and polygenists, and leaves undecided all the
  questions how the variations of mankind arose.But it sounds pedantic;
  and “race” may be understood as meaning the same thing.Footnote 18:

  The whole of this subject has been carefully gone into by the Author
  in a work entitled ‘Rude Stone Monuments’ published in 1872, to which
  the reader is referred.Footnote 19:

  All round the shores of the Mediterranean are found the traces of an
  art which has hitherto been a stumbling-block to antiquarians.Egyptian cartouches and ornaments in Assyria, which are not Egyptian;
  sarcophagi at Tyre, of Egyptian form, but with Phœnician inscriptions,
  and made for Tyrian kings; Greek ornaments in Syria, which are not
  Greek; Roman frescoes or ornaments, and architectural details at
  Carthage, and all over Northern Africa, which however are not Roman.In short, a copying art something like our own, imitating everything,
  understanding nothing.Franks for the
  suggestion that all this art may be Phœnician, in other words,
  Semitic, and I believe he is right.Footnote 20:

  Had there been no Pelasgi in Greece, there probably would have been no
  Architecture of the Grecian period.Footnote 21:

  The derivation of the two words Heathen and Pagan seems to indicate
  the relative importance of these two terms very much in the degree it
  is here wished to express.Heathen is generally understood to be
  derived from ἔθνος, a nation or people; and Pagan from _Pagus,
  Pagani_, a village, or villagers.Both are used here not as terms of
  reproach, but as indicative of their being non-Christian, which is
  what it is wished to express, and was the original intention of the
  term.Footnote 22:

  invalidates the reasoning on which the table was founded, it is here
  reproduced in an abridged form as originally set forth.Footnote 24:

  By a singular coincidence, China has been suffering from a Hyksos
  domination of Tartar conquerors, precisely as Egypt did after the
  period of the Pyramid builders, and, strange to say, for about the
  same period—five centuries.Had the Taepings been successful, we
  should have witnessed in China the exact counterpart of what took

  the hated race.H. Vyse, ‘Operations carried on the Pyramids of Gizeh in 1837.’

  This will be best understood by looking at the section (Woodcut 7), in
  which it will be seen that the so-called coping or casing-stones were
  not simply triangular blocks, filling up the angles formed by the
  receding steps, and which might have been easily displaced, but stones
  from 7 to 10 feet in depth, which could not have been supported unless
  the work had been commenced at the bottom.On the other hand, it is
  difficult to understand how the casing-stones for the upper portion
  could have been raised up the sloping portion completed.It is
  probable, therefore, that the casing was commenced at the angles and
  was carried up in vertical planes, thus leaving a causeway of steps in
  the middle of each face, which diminished in width as the work
  proceeded; this causeway, a few feet wide only, on each face being
  then encased from the top downwards after the apex blocks had been
  laid.—ED.Footnote 31:

  I have ventured to restore the roof of the cella with a sikra (ziggur
  or ziggurah, according to Rawlinson’s ‘Five Ancient Monarchies,’ vol.395, et passim), from finding similar roofs at Susa, Bagdad,
  Keffeli, &c. They are certainly indigenous, and borrowed from some
  older type, whether exactly what is represented here is not clear, it
  must be confessed.It is offered as a suggestion, the reason for which
  will be given when we come to speak of Buddhist or Saracenic
  architecture.Footnote 73:

  Rich gives its dimensions: On the north, 600 feet; south, 657; east,
  546; and west, 408.But it is so ruinous that only an average guess
  can be made at its original dimensions.George Smith, in the
  ‘Athenæum’ of February 1876, wrote a letter giving an account of a
  tablet of the Temple of Belus at Babylon he had deciphered, which
  constitutes the only description found giving the dimensions thereof.The bottom stage was 300 feet square and 110 feet high, the second,
  with raking sides, 260 feet square and 60 feet high, the third 200
  feet square and 20 feet high, the fourth, fifth, and sixth each 20
  feet high and 170, 140, and 110 feet respectively.The top stage,
  which was the sanctuary, was 80 × 70 feet and 50 feet high, the whole
  height being thus 300 feet, the same as the width of the base.W.
  R. Lethaby, in his work on ‘Architecture, Mysticism, and Myth,’ gives
  as a frontispiece a restoration according to these dimensions, the
  appearance of which is more impressive and probably approaches more
  closely to the actual proportions of a ziggurat than any previously
  published, excepting that at Khorsabad, with which in general
  proportion it coincides.—ED.]Footnote 74:

  This chapter and that next following may be regarded as, in all
  essential respects an abridgment or condensation of the information
  contained in a work published by the author in 1851, entitled, ‘The
  Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis Restored,’ the only real difference
  being that the more perfect decipherment of the inscriptions since
  that work was published has caused some of the palaces and buildings
  to be ascribed to different kings and dynasties from those to whom
  they were then assigned, and proved their dates to be more modern than
  was suspected, for the oldest at least.The order of their succession,
  however, remains the same, and so consequently do all the
  architectural inferences drawn from it.Those readers who may desire
  further information on the subject are referred to the work alluded
  to.Footnote 78:

  Published in 1862, in the ‘Athenæum’ journal, No.Footnote 79:

  This plan, with all the particulars here mentioned, are taken from
  Layard’s work, which is the only authority on the subject, so that it
  is not necessary to refer to him on every point.The plan is reduced
  to the usual scale of 100 ft.to 1 inch, for easy comparison with the
  dimensions of all the other edifices quoted throughout this work.Footnote 80:

  The whole of the information regarding Khorsabad is taken from M.
  Botta’s great work on the subject, and its continuation, ‘Ninive et
  l’Assyrie,’ by M. Victor Place.Footnote 81:

  These particulars are all borrowed from M. Place’s great work, ‘Ninive
  et l’Assyrie,’ folio.Footnote 82:

  Space will not admit of my entering into all the reasons for this
  restoration here.If any one wishes for further information on the
  subject, I must refer him to my ‘Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis
  Restored,’ published in 1851.Nothing has occurred during the
  twenty-three years that have elapsed since that work was published
  that has at all shaken my views of the correctness of the data on
  which these restorations were based.On the contrary, every subsequent
  research has served only more and more to convince me of their general
  correctness, and I cannot now suggest any improvement even in details.[It should be noted that the author’s theory as to the covering over
  of the Assyrian halls with a flat roof carried on columns has never
  been accepted by foreign archæologists, and no trace has ever been
  found of the foundations which would be required to carry such
  columns.M. Place, who conducted the excavations at Khorsabad, and
  Messrs.Perrot & Chipiez, who, among others, have devoted much time
  and research to the subject, are of opinion that the halls were
  vaulted.It would be difficult now to determine the possibility of
  building vaults of thirty feet span in crude or unburnt brick, because
  we have no means of testing the resistance to crushing which such
  bricks might afford.The brick voussoirs found by M. Place in the
  arches of the town gates had been prepared in special moulds, and so
  completely dried that liquid clay had been used to cement them
  together.In some of the large halls, far away from the walls, and in
  some cases in the centre of the rooms, huge blocks of hard clay were
  found with their lower surface curved and covered with a layer of
  stucco; these masses were sometimes many metres long, one to two
  metres wide, nearly a metre thick.According to M. Place they formed
  part of a barrel vault covering the halls, and their size would
  account for the immense thickness of the walls constructed to carry
  them and resist their thrust, as well as for the peculiar shape of the
  halls; that is, their length as compared with their breadth.The
  sculptured slabs would seem to have been carved to be seen by a high
  side-light, which suggests openings of some kind, just above the
  springing of the vault, and above the flat roof of the smaller halls
  round.—ED.]Footnote 83:

  These gateways are extremely interesting to the Biblical student,
  inasmuch as they are the only examples which enable us to understand
  the gateways of the Temple at Jerusalem as described by Ezekiel.Their
  dimensions are nearly the same, but the arrangement of the side
  chambers and of gates generally are almost identical.These gates had
  been built 100 years at least before Ezekiel wrote.Footnote 84:

  Layard’s excavations here furnish us with what has not been found or
  has been overlooked elsewhere, _e.g._, a ramp or winding staircase
  leading to the upper storey (‘Nineveh and Babylon,’ 461).As explained
  above, I believe the tops of the walls, which are equal to the floor
  space below, formed such a storey.This ramp at Koyunjik would just
  suffice to lead to them, and goes far to prove the theory.If it was
  similarly situated at Khorsabad it would be in the part fallen away.Footnote 85:

  [This assumption is speculative, no trace of such dwarf columns having
  been found; to raise a solid wall thirteen feet thick to carry a
  gallery seems unlikely.—ED.]Footnote 86:

  This façade, as I read it, is identical with the one I erected at the
  Crystal Palace as a representation of an Assyrian façade, long before
  this slab was exhumed.Footnote 87:

  See Rawlinson, ‘Ancient Monarchies,’ vol.Footnote 88:

  It is called tomb by Strabo, lib.xvi., and Diodorus, xvii.112, 3;
  temple, Herodotus, i.Footnote 89:

  Texier shows columns on the fourth side.Weld Blundell in 1892 found a column with fluted base and Doric
  capital, but it did not apparently belong to the palace.Footnote 91:

  [It follows from what has already been pointed out in a note
  respecting the roofs of the Assyrian palaces; if, as is contended by
  French archæologists, the great halls were vaulted, Mr.Fergusson’s
  theory respecting the origin of the Persian columns partly falls to
  the ground; in that case it would seem more probable that the Persians
  owed their columnar architecture to prototypes of wooden posts,
  covered with metal plates, such as are described as existing in the
  Median palaces of Ecbatana, where Cyrus, the first Persian monarch,
  passed so many years of his life.—ED.]Footnote 92:

  The woodcuts in this chapter, except the restorations, are taken from
  Flandin and Coste’s ‘Voyage en Perse,’ except where the contrary is
  mentioned.Footnote 93:

  It is curious that neither Ker Porter, nor Texier, nor Flandin and
  Coste, though measuring this building on the spot, could make out its
  plan.Yet nothing can well be more certain, once it is pointed out.Footnote 94:

  ‘Palaces of Nineveh and Persepolis Restored,’ p.[The prayer platform or talar represented on the tomb of Darius is
  extremely unlike any constructional feature such as an upper storey,
  and may have been placed there only to give dignity and importance to
  the figure of the king: the hall of the Palace of Darius could easily
  have been lighted by clerestory windows over the roofs of the smaller
  chambers on each side.—ED.]Footnote 95:

  It is very strange that this similarity, like the plan of the square
  halls, should hitherto have escaped observation.Had any one looked at
  the matter as a whole we should have been spared some restorations
  which are too absurd even to merit exposure.[The restorations referred to are those in which the columns of the
  Great Hall and of the porticoes are shown as isolated features
  standing on the platforms.The authors of these designs would appear
  to have been misled by Messrs.Flandin and Coste’s plan, in which the
  drains are shown as if they ran under the line of the wall proposed by
  Mr.Fergusson, the enclosing wall of the Great Hall.Weld
  Blundell’s researches (1891), however, have shown that the main drain
  really lies under the hall, and between the enclosure wall and the
  first row of columns, and that the vertical rain-water shafts which
  were built into the wall communicated direct with this main drain.These shafts, cut in stone, in some cases rise above the level of the
  platform, which show that they were not intended to carry off the
  surface water from the platform.Weld Blundell discovered also the
  traces of the foundation of walls at the angles where shown by Mr.It would seem that in course of time the platforms have
  become coated with so hard and uniform a covering as to suggest its
  being the natural surface; when once broken through, however, the
  evidences of foundations of various walls are abundant.—ED.]Footnote 96:

  M. Dieulafoy’s work on the Acropolis of Susa has just (1893) appeared,
  but, so far as the palace is concerned, his discoveries do not add
  much to our knowledge.He appears to have arrived at the conclusion
  that the great hall (which in plan resembles that of the palace of
  Xerxes—Woodcut 94) was not enclosed on the south side, but was left
  open to the court in the same way as the great reception halls of the
  later Parthian and Sassanian kings at Al Hadhr, Firouzabad, and
  Ctesiphon.Footnote 97:

  It is now generally considered that these two buildings were tombs;
  the projecting bosses, as shown on woodcut, are in reality sinkings,
  and were probably decorative only.—ED.Footnote 98:

  M. Dieulafoy claims to have traced the plan of a temple at Susa which
  consisted of a sanctuary the roof of which was supported by four
  columns, with a portico-in-antis in front, and a large open court,
  measuring about 50 ft.by 40 ft., in the middle of which was placed
  the fire-altar.The whole building was enclosed with a corridor or
  passage, with entrances so arranged that no one could see inside the
  temple from without.—ED.Flinders Petrie’s latest excavations at Medum have resulted in the
  discovery of small brick arches over a passage in the sepulchral pit
  of Rahotep of the 4th dynasty.Footnote 100:

  Since the article on the Temple in Smith’s ‘Dictionary of the Bible’
  was written, from which most of the woodcuts in this chapter are
  taken, I have had occasion to go over the subject more than once, and
  from recent explorations and recently discovered analogies have, I
  believe, been able to settle, within very narrow limits of doubt, all
  the outstanding questions with reference to this celebrated building.I have in consequence written and published a monograph of the Temple,
  but have deemed it more expedient to leave the illustrations here as
  they are.Footnote 109:

  “Toward the centre of the monument two large stones were found leaning
  at an angle the one against the other, and forming a sort of tent,
  like in Woodcut 124, under which was presently discovered a small
  statue of Minerva seated on a chariot with four horses, and an urn of
  metal filled with ashes, charcoal, and burnt bones.This urn, which is
  now in the possession of the Comte de Choiseul, is enriched in
  sculpture with a vine branch, from which is suspended bunches of
  grapes done with exquisite art.”—‘Description of the Plain of Troy,’
  translated by Dalzel, Edin.If this is so, this is no doubt the vessel mentioned, ‘Iliad,’ xvi.92; ‘Od.,’ xxiv.and why has not the fact of its existence been more insisted upon?Footnote 118:

  One of the most interesting facts brought to light in Dr.Schliemann’s
  excavations is that between the age of the “Ilium Vetus” of Homer,
  rich in metals and in arts, and the “Ilium Novum” of Strabo, a people
  ignorant of use of the metals, and using only bone and stone
  implements, inhabited the mound at Hissarlik which covered both these
  cities.This discovery is sufficient to upset the once fashionable
  Danish theory of the three ages—Stone, Bronze, and Iron—but,
  unfortunately, adds nothing to our knowledge of architecture.These
  people, whoever they were, built nothing, and must consequently be
  content to remain in the “longa nocte” of those who neglect the Master
  Art.Footnote 119:

  This tomb is considered by M. Renan (Mission de Phœnicie, Paris 1864)
  to be of Phœnician origin, who remarks generally on their work:
  “Phœnician tombs are generally excavated in the solid rock; their
  architecture is the carved rock without columns; they obtained all
  they could out of the solid rock, leaving it as they found it, with
  more or less attempt to make it graceful; the fact that it was worked
  before being transported suggests that as it left the quarry so it
  remained, no sound of hammer or saw being heard during its erection.”
  There is another tomb at Marathos also attributed to the Phœnicians,
  which is partly cut out of the rock and partially built in large
  blocks of masonry.Footnote 121:

  In reality the monument stands exactly over the centre of the rock-cut
  sepulchre.The section-line must, therefore, be understood to be
  carried back about 10 feet from the face of the monument.Footnote 122:

  These antæ (parastades) or responds were destined in the first case to
  protect the angles of the wall, and in the second case to support the
  beams carried by them and the columns between, the sun-dried brick
  wall being not to be relied on; in the later Greek temples the walls
  were built in stone and marble, and the parastades became therefore no
  longer constructional necessities, being retained only as decorative

  feet.Footnote 132:

  This refers only to the columns and antæ; the lower portion of the
  walls, 3 feet 6 inches high, were in stone; above this clay bricks
  were employed in building the walls, and it was to the disintegration
  of these that we owe the preservation of the Hermes of Praxiteles,
  which was found embedded in a thick layer of clay.At first it was
  thought that this clay had been washed down from the neighbouring
  <DW72>s of the hill of Kronos.Footnote 133:

  M. J. Thacher Clarke, who directed the American expedition in 1881, is
  now occupied with a monograph on the subject, and a report by him was
  published in 1882.Footnote 134:

  A proto-Ionic capital of early date was found in 1882 on the summit of
  Mount Chigri, in the Troad, by Mr.J. Thacher Clarke, and is described
  in the American Journal of Archæology, Baltimore.Another
  example ascribed to Phœnician artists was found at Trapeza in Cyprus,
  and is now in the Louvre; both are of the same type as that which is
  represented in the ivory carvings from the north-western palace of
  Nimroud, now in the British Museum, so that the Asiatic origin of the
  order is thus confirmed.Footnote 135:

  Pausanias, viii.Footnote 137:

  [The earliest example in stone at Benihasan is of less diameter than
  the columns at Kalabscheh, so that it is difficult to draw this
  distinction; we have already shown also (p.115 note) that wooden
  shafts of the twelfth dynasty have been found at Kahun, and this and
  the existence of the base proves their wooden origin.If therefore the
  Greek Doric column was derived originally from Egypt, as Mr.Fergusson
  believed, then its earlier wooden parentage must be accepted.Further
  evidence on this subject however has been afforded by the discoveries
  at Olympia, and the references in consequence made to Greek authors;
  all these show without doubt that the columns of the temple of Hera
  were originally in wood, and were gradually replaced by stone.The
  theory that the pillars in Egypt or early Greece were built in
  brickwork or rubble masonry is not borne out by the discoveries at
  Tiryns, for the walls of the palace there, in rubble and clay mortar,
  were of such weak construction that posts of timber were required to
  carry the epistyle or beam, either isolated as columns or built up
  against the wall as antæ.Fergusson’s theory that a pillar, originally copied from the
  wooden post, is slenderer at first, and gradually departs from the
  wood form as the style advances, is borne out by the evidence of the
  Egypt lotus column; this, as found in the rock-cut tombs of Benihasan,
  is of very small diameter, and quite unequal to carry the weight of
  any stone superstructure; whereas afterwards in the temples at Thebes
  it assumes a proportion nearer that of the earliest Greek Doric
  example at Corinth.—ED.]Footnote 138:

  These facts have all been fully elucidated by Mr.Penrose in his
  beautiful work containing the results of his researches on the
  Parthenon and other temples of Greece, published by the Dilettanti
  Society.Footnote 139:

  For measurements we depend on Penrose, ‘Principles of Athenian
  Architecture,’ &c., fol.; and Cockerell, ‘The Temples of Egina and
  Bassæ,’ Lond.The details of the system were first publicly
  announced by Watkiss Lloyd, in a paper read to the Institute of
  British Architects in 1859; afterwards in an appendix to Mr.Cockerell’s work, and in several minor publications.Footnote 140:

  The pyramid-building kings of Lower Egypt seem to have had some
  distinct ideas of a system of definite proportions in architectural
  building, and to have put it into practice in the pyramid, and
  possibly elsewhere, but it has not yet been sought for in the other
  buildings of that age.At times I cannot help suspecting more affinity to have existed
  between the inhabitants of Lower Egypt and those of Greece than is at
  first sight apparent.Footnote 141:

  It was called Zoophorus (_life_ or _figure bearer_).Footnote 142:

  [The reasons which induced the late Mr.Fergusson to suggest an
  “opaion,” or clerestory, were fully set forth in the ‘True Principles
  of Beauty in Art,’ in 1849.A paper on the same subject was
  communicated by him to the Royal Institute of British Architects in
  1861, and published in their “Transactions” for that year.Since his
  death, however, Mr.Penrose’s discovery that the Temple of Jupiter
  Olympius at Athens was really octastyle has thrown a new light on the
  question of hypæthral temples; and, as Dr.Dorpfield remarks in his
  essay on the “Hypæthral Temple” (communicated to the R. I. B. A. on
  Dec.19): “The words of Vitruvius have now received quite another
  interpretation, through the excavation of the Olympieion at Athens, to
  that which they have had up to the present.The most important proof
  of the hypæthral lighting of the temples of antiquity has now turned
  into a proof against the same;” and he concludes his arguments by
  stating: “After it has been shown by the excavations that the
  Olympieion at Athens is the sole example of a great hypæthral temple
  mentioned by Vitruvius, we can answer this much-vexed question of the
  lighting of the temples of antiquity in this way—that a few great
  dipteral hypæthral temples existed, but that the Greek and Roman
  temples had as a rule no light from above, and were only lighted from
  the door.”—ED.]Footnote 143:

  Among the many attempts made to restore the interior of this temple,
  the last and most elaborate is that by the late E. Beulé, ‘Acropole
  d’Athènes,’ 1854, vol.; but it is also one of the worst.Indeed it is quite painful to see how the author twists his
  authorities to meet a preconceived theory.Without going into it,
  there is one objection which seems fatal to the whole.Like most antiquaries when in difficulties for lighting Greek temples,
  he takes off the roof and makes the Temple of Pandrosus an open
  courtyard, in which he plants the olive.This is so opposed to the
  whole spirit of Greek art as to be inadmissible on general grounds,
  but in this instance it introduces the further absurdity that the
  Greeks opened three windows in the west wall of the temple to light
  this courtyard which was already open to the sky!The mode of lighting
  a temple by vertical windows is so exceptional that it would not have
  been introduced here had any other means existed of lighting the
  interior, and consequently the combination shown by M. Beulé seems
  simply impossible.Footnote 149:

  centum viginti septem a singulis regibus factæ, lx.pedum altitudine:
  ex iis xxxvi.cælatæ, una a Scopa.”—H.Wood places two in the pronaos and two in the posticum, thus
  reducing the depth of the opisthodomus; beyond the pronaos he places a
  vestibule and omits the staircases as shown on plan 159.Fergusson returned to the subject again, and published in the
  Transactions of the Institute (session 1882-83) a revised plan, to
  which we refer our readers.—ED.]Footnote 151:

  The finial ornament is triangular in plan, and there are three scrolls
  on the roof with mortices in them, showing that something must have
  stood on them to support the projecting angles.Dolphins and various
  other objects have been suggested.My own conviction is that they were
  winged genii, most probably in bronze, and gilt like the neckings of
  the capitals.Dorpfield is of opinion that in the Greek theatres of the best
  period there was no proscenium, or raised stage, and that the actors
  played their parts in the orchestra on the same level as the chorus.Professor Middleton also points out that in the earliest Greek
  theatres built in the 5th and 4th centuries B.C.the orchestra was a
  complete circle, the space being gradually diminished by the bringing
  forward of the stage.—ED.]Footnote 153:

  It will not be necessary to enter here into all the details of this
  restoration.They will be found in a separate work published by me on
  the subject, to which the reader is referred.[The student should also
  refer to the restoration suggested by M. Pullan in the work published
  by him and Sir Charles Newton (‘Discoveries at Halicarnassus, 1862’).In the arrangement and design of the podium it accords better with
  other examples of Greek tombs than Mr.The three columns
  as shown at the angle of Mr.Fergusson’s peristyle would be quite
  repugnant to any student of Greek architecture.—ED.]Footnote 155:

  These two temples, like almost all the others of Rome, have recently
  been renamed by the Roman or rather German antiquaries.The Jupiter
  Tonans is now the Temple of Saturn, and the Jupiter Stator is decreed
  to have been the Temple of Castor and Pollux.The names by which they
  are currently known has been adhered to, as the architecture is of
  more importance here than the archæology.Footnote 167:

  When the first edition of this work was written I believed the rotunda
  to have been added to the portico by Severus; and if this were so it
  would get over many of the difficulties arising from its size and the
  character of its brickwork.My personal examination, however, has
  forced me very unwillingly to give up this hypothesis.It certainly
  is, however, very astonishing that such a vault should have been
  attempted at so early an age.[There seems to be some probability that Mr.Fergusson’s first belief
  was correct, and that the Rotunda was built by Hadrian, bricks with
  the stamp of his period having been found in the casing and in the
  bond courses in the solid concrete both of the drum and in the dome.The discovery is due to M. Chedanne, one of the “Grand Prix” students
  in the Villa Medici, who had selected the subject for his “Envoi de
  Rome,” and was allowed to superintend certain repairs and restorations
  which were required in the Pantheon.It would seem that the portico
  erected by Agrippa preceded a temple with cella of the ordinary form,
  the pavement of which has been found nearly seven feet below the floor
  of the present church.From this it follows that when the Rotunda was
  erected in the first half of the second century, the portico, which is
  undoubtedly of Agrippa’s time, must have been taken down and rebuilt
  on to it, and this explains Mr.Fergusson’s reasons for insisting that
  the portico was built on to the Rotunda.The theory as to the Pantheon
  forming part of Agrippa’s bath is thus disposed of.Independently of
  that, however, Prof.Middleton has pointed out that the discoveries
  made in 1882, by the removal of the block of houses at the back,
  showed that there was no connection whatever between the two
  buildings.Traces exist of the original marble lining, and of cornices
  which were continued round the dome, showing that originally the
  complete circuit was exposed to view.Middleton
  states, “if further proof were wanting to contradict the theory that
  the Pantheon was over the Calidarum or Laconicum of the bath, this is
  supplied by the fact that there is no trace of any hypocaust under the
  floor, but merely an ancient drain to carry away the rain-water that
  fell through the opening in the dome.The Pantheon, too, is on the
  north side of the Thermæ—a very improbable position for the Laconicum,
  or hot room, which was usually placed on the sunny side of the
  buildings.”—ED.]Footnote 170:

  The bronze plates which were removed by Pope Urban VIII.in 1626 to
  make cannon, and also for the great Baldachino in St.Peter’s, were
  taken from the portico; the coffers of the interior of the dome were
  decorated, according to Prof.Middleton, with mouldings in stucco
  painted and gilt.Footnote 171:

  This building is commonly called a temple, though it is not known to
  what deity it was dedicated.My own impression is that it was a tomb,
  or at least a funereal monument of some sort.Footnote 172:

  Owing to a misreading of Vitruvius’s statement respecting the temple
  it had always been classed as decastyle.Penrose’s researches
  published in the ‘Transactions of the Royal Institute of British
  Architects,’ vol.Footnote 173:

  See ‘The True Principles of Beauty in Art,’ where the reasons for this
  arrangement will be found stated at length.[See note on page
  272.—ED.]Footnote 174:

  Canina, in his restoration, shows a flat roof with coffers, so there
  is probably no exact authority for its form, though it seems to be
  generally agreed that the centre was not hypæthral.Footnote 175:

  This basilica is generally represented as having an apse at either
  end; but there is no authority whatever for this, and general analogy
  would lead us rather to infer that it was not the case.Middleton, however, is of opinion that an apse existed at both ends,
  and shows the same in his restoration of the plan of Trajan’s
  form.—‘The Remains of Ancient Rome,’ by J. H. Middleton, Fig.Footnote 176:

  One of the pillars of this basilica remained _in situ_ till the year
  1614, when it was removed by Carlo Maderno, by order of Paul V., and
  re-erected in the piazza of St.M. Maggiore, where it now stands as a
  monumental column, supporting a statue of the Virgin.The column, with
  its base and capital, is as nearly as may be 60 ft.in height; the
  whole monument, as it now stands, 140 ft.Footnote 177:

  As it was sunk slightly below the pavement of the peristyle, and
  drains leading from it were traced by Mr.Ashpitel, it was probably
  hypæthral.Footnote 178:

  The theatres of Curio and Scaurus were in timber, except the
  proscenium of the latter, which was partly decorated with marble and
  mosaics.The Theatre of Pompey, B.C.54, was in stone, and parts of it
  still exist (Prof.The Theatre of Marcellus was begun by
  Julius Cæsar, but not completed till 13 B.C., when it was opened by
  Augustus.It was subsequently restored after a fire by Vespasian, but
  the purity and simplicity of the architecture, and the refinement of
  the details, in comparison with those of the Colosseum, 70-80 A.D.,
  are in favour of the earlier date assigned to it.Middleton
  quotes another theatre, that of Cornelius Balbus (13 B.C.), built to
  the north-west of the Theatre of Marcellus.Middleton the Amphitheatre of Sutrium is of Roman
  origin, and but little earlier than the Colosseum at Rome.“There is
  really no evidence,” he says (p.76), “that amphitheatres were built
  by the Etruscans; and there can be little doubt that they were purely
  Roman inventions.”

Footnote 180:

  At the Crystal Palace it has always been found necessary to allow 6

  Considerable difference of opinion seems to exist as to the extent of
  the velaria which sheltered the arena; this was supported by masts
  fixed outside the upper part of the walls, resting on brackets, 14 ft.below the cornice, which was cut away to allow the mast to fit close
  against the wall.M. Gérôme suggests, in his well-known picture of the
  Roman gladiators, that the velaria extended over a portion of the
  arena only.Middleton states, “The awning did not, as has been
  sometimes supposed, cover the whole amphitheatre, a thing which would
  have been practically impossible, owing to the enormous strain of so
  long a bearing, far beyond what any ropes could bear.It simply sloped
  down over the spectators in the cavea, leaving the whole central arena
  uncovered.” In case of rain, however, this might have been
  inconvenient, and it would not have protected the spectators from the
  sun, supposing that the performances lasted the whole day.Besides,
  there is no reason why the masts should have been carried so high
  above the wall, as shown in the restoration in Prof.Middleton’s book,
  p.Alma Tadema is of opinion that the velarium extended over
  the whole arena, and was suspended on a principle similar to that of a
  suspension bridge, the ridge, or highest portion lying between the
  foci of the ellipse.This accounts in a much more satisfactory way for
  the height of the masts, and would afford facilities for the draining
  off of the rain on to the top of the gallery round.Footnote 182:

  These baths have been carefully measured by M. Blouet, who has also
  published a restoration of them.This is, on the whole, certainly the
  best account we have of any of these establishments.Middleton this magnificent hall appears to have
  been what Spartianus calls the _cella soliaris_, the ceiling of which
  he says was formed of interlaced bars of gilt bronze.When the
  excavations in this hall were being made, many tons of fragments of
  iron girders were found.Aitchison)
  compound girders, formed of two T bars riveted together, and then
  cased in bronze.A sort of lattice-work ceiling had been formed with
  these bronze-cased girders, the panels being probably filled in with
  concrete made of light pumice-stone, worked with fine stucco reliefs,
  painted and gilt.Middleton is of opinion that the central part
  over the swimming-bath was left open for the admission of light.In
  the upper part of the walls deep sinkings to receive the ends of the
  great girders which supported the ceiling are clearly visible.George’s Hall at Liverpool is the most exact copy in modern times
  of a part of these baths.The Hall itself is a reproduction both in
  scale and design of the central hall of Caracalla’s baths, but
  improved in detail and design, having five bays instead of only three.With the two courts at each end, it makes up a suite of apartments
  very similar to those found in the Roman examples.The whole building,
  however, is less than one-fourth of the size of the central mass of a
  Roman bath, and therefore gives but little idea of the magnificence of
  the whole.Footnote 187:

  The left-hand wing of this arch has since been restored by M.
  Viollet-le-Duc, and the right-hand wing cleared of the square building
  in front of it.Footnote 188:

  These two buildings are described further on (p.544) as Christian
  edifices.Footnote 189:

  Professor Middleton states: “This building appears to be a nymphæum,
  or a part of some baths of about the time of Gallienus (263-268
  A.D.).” It was known in the Middle Ages as the “Terme de Gallucio.”
  The site of the real Temple of Minerva Medica was discovered in 1887
  (according to the same authority) between the new Via Macchiavelli and
  the Via Buonarroti, about 7 ft.Footnote 191:

  M. de Saulcy has recently attempted to prove that these tombs are
  those of the kings of Judah from David downwards.Their architecture
  is undoubtedly as late as the Christian era, and the cover of the
  sarcophagus which is now in the Louvre under the title of that of
  David is probably of the same date as these tombs, or if anything more
  modern.Footnote 192:

  Though the dates of all these tombs at Cyrene are so uncertain, there
  seems little doubt that if any one thoroughly versed in the style were
  to visit the place, he could fix the age of all of them with
  approximate correctness.The one difficulty is, that a chronometric
  scale taken from the buildings at Rome, or even in Syria, will not
  suffice.Local peculiarities must be taken into account and allowed
  for, and this requires both time and judgment.Footnote 194:

  like it.All the others were erected as designed by the architects who
  built the churches, and none fit so well.Footnote 229:

  [This rule cannot be made a hard and fast one.Procopius states that
  in the central dome of the Church of the Apostles, Constantinople,
  “the circular building standing above the arches is pierced with
  windows, and the spherical dome which over-arches it seems to be
  suspended in the air.” In the church of St.Sergius at Constantinople
  the walls of the octagon, which are pierced with windows, are carried
  up to the vault, and in the church of Sta.Sophia at Thessalonica the
  windows are pierced in an upright dome cylindrical internally.In all
  these cases, however, there is a marked distinction between these
  examples and those of the lofty cylindrical drums which were employed
  in the Neo-Byzantine churches.Fergusson’s rule, therefore, with
  these exceptions, may be taken as absolute.—ED.]Footnote 234:

  Even if it should be asserted that this is no proof that the
  inhabitants of these countries were Buddhists in those days, it seems
  tolerably certain that they were tree-worshippers, which is very
  nearly the same thing.Procopius tells us that “even in his day these
  barbarians worshipped forests and groves, and in their barbarous
  simplicity placed the trees among their gods.” (‘De Bello Gotico,’

  The particulars and illustrations of this church are taken from a
  paper by Heinrich Keissenberger, in the ‘Jahrbuch der K. K. Commission
  für Enthaltung der Baudenkmale,’ 1860.A model of it, full size, was
  exhibited at the Paris Exhibition of 1867.Footnote 257:

  [It has been assumed that the Roman basilicas were taken possession of
  by the early Christians for their own religious services, but as Mr.G. G. Scott points out in his ‘Essay on the History of English Church
  Architecture,’ “there is no well-authenticated instance of the
  conversion of any Pagan basilica into a Christian church, whilst there
  are abundant examples of Pagan temples converted into Christian
  sanctuaries” (see Texier and Pullan’s ‘Byzantine Architecture,’ pp.Scott observes, “on the face of it
  improbable, if we reflect that the conversion of the government to
  Christianity had no tendency to render the existing basilicas less
  necessary for legal business, after the peace of the church, than they
  had been before that event.Christianity, unfortunately, could not
  abolish the litigious instincts of our nature, and after fifteen
  centuries of the gospel the legal profession still flourishes.” The
  buildings which were rendered useless by the official recognition of
  the new faith were not the basilicas but the temples, the fact being
  that the class of building known as a basilica (a term never used by
  either the writers or architects of Byzantine times), with its wide
  central nave and aisles with galleries over them lighted by clerestory
  or side windows, and covered with a timber roof, constituted the
  simplest and most economical building of large size which could be
  constructed to hold a vast assembly of worshippers; especially as the
  only features which can be looked upon as having any architectural
  pretensions, viz., the columns and their capitals, could be taken
  wholesale from temples and other Roman buildings.The semicircular
  apse, which alone in the Roman basilica served as a court of law,
  became the tribune for the bishop and presbyters.Scott is even inclined to assign an earlier and more independent
  origin for the basilican form.According to his theory the germ of the
  Christian basilica was a simple oblong aisleless room divided by a
  cross arch, beyond which lay an altar detached from the wall.This
  germ was developed by the addition of side aisles, and sometimes an
  aisle returned across the entrance, and over these upper aisles were
  next constructed and transepts added, together with the oratories or
  chapels in various parts of the building.Butler, in his work on
  ‘The Ancient Coptic Churches of Egypt,’ accepts this theory, as the
  churches of Egypt are rich in evidence that favours it.At the same
  time, the first great basilica erected by Constantine, viz., the
  Vatican (St.Peter’s), and the Lateran, (St.John Lateran), are of too
  great importance to warrant the suggestion that their origin should be
  sought for in the very small though possibly earlier examples in Egypt
  or the East.—ED.]Footnote 258:

  This probably refers to its foundation, for M. Cattaneo, in his work
  ‘L’architecture en Italie, 1890,’ judging by its ornamental detail,
  places the church in the second half of the seventh century.Footnote 259:

  ‘Antiquités,’ vol.Footnote 260:

  _Eodem_, vol.Alfred J. Butler’s work, already referred to, has thrown
  considerable light on the subject, though, as he was unable to visit
  any of the Coptic churches up the Nile, we are still left in doubt as
  to the age of the convent near Siout and other buildings.From
  comparison of the plans and descriptions given in Denon, Curzon and
  Pococke of these buildings, with those in Cairo and Old Cairo, Mr.Butler ascribes them to the fourth century, that which in fact is
  claimed for them as having been founded by Sta.On this
  subject he says, p.365: “Were there no more of evidence besides to
  determine the truth of this tradition, the plan of the Haikal (the
  central of the three chapels in a Coptic church) would decide it
  beyond question.The persistence with which certain churches are
  ascribed to Sta.Helena by a people utterly ignorant of history and
  architecture is in itself remarkable, and it is still more remarkable
  to find that these churches are always marked by a particular form of
  Haikal.Indeed, so regular is the coincidence, that a deep apsidal
  haikal with recesses all round it and columns close against the wall
  may be almost infallibly dated from the age of Sta.Helena.”

Footnote 262:

  The older church has been so altered and ruined by the subsequent
  rebuildings that it is extremely difficult to make out its history.It
  seems, however, to have been built originally above the site of an old
  Mithraic temple, which has recently been cleared out, and probably
  before the time of Gregory the Great.It was apparently rebuilt, or
  nearly so, by Adrian I., 772, and burnt by Robert Guiscard, 1084.The
  upper church seems to have been erected by Paschal, 1099-1118.The
  question is, to what age do the frescoes found on the walls of the
  older church belong?Some of the heads and single figures may, I
  fancy, be anterior even to the time of Adrian; but the bulk of the
  paintings seem certainly to have been added between his age and 1084,
  and nearer the latter than the former date.If it had not been
  entirely ruined in 1084 Paschal would not have so completely
  obliterated it a century afterwards.A considerable quantity of the
  materials of the old church were used in the new, which tends further
  to confuse the chronology.Footnote 263:

  The dates here given generally refer to the building now existing or

  giving a full quotation from Eusebius of Constantine’s basilica at
  Jerusalem, in which he points out that the orientation of primitive
  times is the reverse of that which has become general in later times,
  continues his enquiry into the evidence afforded by the numerous early
  basilicas in Rome itself.Of about fifty churches of early date, in
  forty of them the sanctuary is placed at the western end, and of the
  remaining ten (one of which is the great church of St.Paolo fuori le
  Mura), there are only seven which appear to have retained their
  original form, and which have an eastward sanctuary.The exact orientation of the sanctuary in each case has been added to
  the list.—ED.]Footnote 266:

  and four other domes.Procopius speaks of the church being surrounded
  within by columns placed both above and below, probably referring to
  galleries similar to those in St.Mark’s the columns exist in one storey only, and the main wall is
  carried up at the back of the aisles to give increased size inside.Footnote 280:

  In support of this statement he points out that twice during Christian
  times it had been found necessary to raise the floor of the church.The nave floor, which in 1857 was two steps below that of the aisles,
  was raised in 1881 to the same level; but two feet nine inches below
  the nave floor before it was raised there existed, according to Prof.Eitelberger, another mosaic pavement, which must have been the floor
  of the first basilica erected, and which was pulled down by Bishop
  Euphrasius in 543.This lower pavement extended also under the three
  chapels of the confessio, which suggests that these are part of the
  first basilica.Footnote 284:

  The same polygonal form is found in the apses of St.Apollinare in Classe, St.Apollinare in Nuovo, St.Vitale, all in Ravenna, and St.Footnote 285:

  The apses of two churches, of the 4th and 6th century respectively, in
  the island of Paros, are similarly fitted with marble seats: in the
  6th century church there are eight rows, so that the apse looks like a
  small amphitheatre.Footnote 286:

  That is on the supposition that the word kirk is derived from the
  Latin word “circus,” “circular,” as the French term it, “cirque.” My
  own conviction is that this is certainly the case.The word is only
  used by the Barbarians as applied to a form of buildings they derived
  from the Romans.Why the Germans should employ κυρίου οἶκος, when
  neither the Greeks nor the Latins used that name, is a mystery which
  those who insist on these very improbable names have as yet failed to
  explain.Footnote 287:

  the vaults of the Circus of Maxentius, on the Via Appia.—ED.]Footnote 292:

  In this building they now show a sarcophagus of ancient date, said to

  Cattaneo to be the most ancient campanile known in which the wall
  surface is broken up with flat pilasters or vertical bands in relief,
  and divided into storeys by horizontal string courses, with ranges of
  small blind arches below, carried on corbels, and may be regarded as
  the prototype of the most characteristic Lombard towers.—ED.]Footnote 305:

   Beloved!your hair was golden
   As tender tints of sunrise,
   As corn beside the River
         In softly varying hues.I loved you for your slightness,
   Your melancholy sweetness,
   Your changeful eyes, that promised
         What your lips would still refuse.You came to me, and loved me,
   Were mine upon the River,
   The azure water saw us
         And the blue transparent sky;
   The Lotus flowers knew it,
   Our happiness together,
   While life was only River,
         Only love, and you and I.

   Love wakened on the River,
   To sounds of running water,
   With silver Stars for witness
         And reflected Stars for light;
   Awakened to existence,
   With ripples for first music
   And sunlight on the River
         For earliest sense of sight.Love grew upon the River
   Among the scented flowers,
   The open rosy flowers
         Of the Lotus buds in bloom--
   Love, brilliant as the Morning,
   More fervent than the Noon-day,
   And tender as the Twilight
         In its blue transparent gloom.Cold snow upon the mountains,
   The Lotus leaves turned yellow
         And the water very grey.Our kisses faint and falter,
   The clinging hands unfasten,
   The golden time is over
         And our passion dies away.To be forgotten,
           A ripple on the River,
           That flashes in the sunset,
           That flashed,--and died away.Second Song: The Girl from Baltistan

                            Throb, throb, throb,
   Far away in the blue transparent Night,
   On the outer horizon of a dreaming consciousness,
   She hears the sound of her lover's nearing boat
               Afar, afloat
   On the river's loneliness, where the Stars are the only light;
      Hear the sound of the straining wood
          Like a broken sob
          Of a heart's distress,
      Loving misunderstood.She lies, with her loose hair spent in soft disorder,
   On a silken sheet with a purple woven border,
   Every cell of her brain is latent fire,
   Every fibre tense with restrained desire.And the straining oars sound clearer, clearer,
          The boat is approaching nearer, nearer;
        "How to wait through the moments' space
        Till I see the light of my lover's face?"Throb, throb, throb,
   The sound dies down the stream
   Till it only clings at the senses' edge
   Like a half-remembered dream.Doubtless, he in the silence lies,
         His fair face turned to the tender skies,
         Starlight touching his sleeping eyes.While his boat caught in the thickset sedge
   And the waters round it gurgle and sob,
         Or floats set free on the river's tide,
                                  Oars laid aside.She is awake and knows no rest,
   Passion dies and is dispossessed
          Of his brief, despotic power.But the Brain, once kindled, would still be afire
   Were the whole world pasture to its desire,
   And all of love, in a single hour,--
   A single wine cup, filled to the brim,
                              Given to slake its thirst.Some there are who are thus-wise cursed
         Times that follow fulfilled desire
         Are of all their hours the worst.They find no Respite and reach no Rest,
   Though passion fail and desire grow dim,
         No assuagement comes from the thing possessed
                      For possession feeds the fire."Oh, for the life of the bright hued things
          Whose marriage and death are one,
        A floating fusion on golden wings."But we who re-marry a thousand times,
          As the spirit or senses will,
        In a thousand ways, in a thousand climes,
          We remain unsatisfied still."As her lover left her, alone, awake she lies,
   With a sleepless brain and weary, half-closed eyes.She turns her face where the purple silk is spread,
   Still sweet with delicate perfume his presence shed.Her arms remembered his vanished beauty still,
   And, reminiscent of clustered curls, her fingers thrill.While the wonderful, Starlit Night wears slowly on
   Till the light of another day, serene and wan,
                              Pierces the eastern skies.Palm Trees by the Sea

     Only yourself could console.For that fierce fervour and fire
   Burnt through my lips to my soul
     From the white heat of your kiss!You were the essence of Spring,
     Wayward and bright as a flame:
   Though we have drifted apart,
     Still how the syllables sing
   Mixed in your musical name,
     Deep in the well of my heart!Once in the lingering light,
     Thrown from the west on the Sea,
   Laid you your garments aside,
     Slender and goldenly bright,
   Glimmered your beauty, set free,
     Bright as a pearl in the tide.Once, ere the thrill of the dawn
     Silvered the edge of the sea,
   I, who lay watching you rest,--
     Pale in the chill of the morn
   Found you still dreaming of me
     Stilled by love's fancies possessed.Fallen on sorrowful days,
     Love, let me thank you for this,
   You were so happy with me!Wrapped in Youth's roseate haze,
   Wanting no more than my kiss
     By the blue edge of the sea!Ah, for those nights on the sand
     Under the palms by the sea,
   For the strange dream of those days
     Spent in the passionate land,
   For your youth given to me,
     I am your debtor always!Song by Gulbaz

   "Is it safe to lie so lonely when the summer twilight closes
   No companion maidens, only you asleep among the roses?"Thirteen, fourteen years you number, and your hair is soft and scented,
   Perilous is such a slumber in the twilight all untented."Lonely loveliness means danger, lying in your rose-leaf nest,
   What if some young passing stranger broke into your careless rest?"But she would not heed the warning, lay alone serene and slight,
   Till the rosy spears of morning slew the darkness of the night.Young love, walking softly, found her, in the scented, shady closes,
   Threw his ardent arms around her, kissed her lips beneath the roses.And she said, with smiles and blushes, "Would that I had sooner known!Never now the morning thrushes wake and find me all alone."Since you said the rose-leaf cover sweet protection gave, but slight,
   I have found this dear young lover to protect me through the night!"Kashmiri Song

   Pale hands I love beside the Shalimar,
     Where are you now?Whom do you lead on Rapture's roadway, far,
     Before you agonise them in farewell?Oh, pale dispensers of my Joys and Pains,
     Holding the doors of Heaven and of Hell,
   How the hot blood rushed wildly through the veins
     Beneath your touch, until you waved farewell.Pale hands, pink tipped, like Lotus buds that float
     On those cool waters where we used to dwell,
   I would have rather felt you round my throat,
     Crushing out life, than waving me farewell!Reverie of Ormuz the Persian

   Softly the feathery Palm-trees fade in the violet Distance,
   Faintly the lingering light touches the edge of the sea,
   Sadly the Music of Waves, drifts, faint as an Anthem's insistence,
   Heard in the aisles of a dream, over the sandhills, to me.Now that the Lights are reversed, and the Singing changed into sighing,
   Now that the wings of our fierce, fugitive passion are furled,
   Take I unto myself, all alone in the light that is dying,
   Much of the sorrow that lies hid at the Heart of the World.Sad am I, sad for your loss: for failing the charm of your presence,
   Even the sunshine has paled, leaving the Zenith less blue.Even the ocean lessens the light of its green opalescence,
   Since, to my sorrow I loved, loved and grew weary of, you.Why was our passion so fleeting, why had the flush of your beauty
   Only so slender a spell, only so futile a power?Yet, even thus ever is life, save when long custom or duty
   Moulds into sober fruit Love's fragile and fugitive flower.Fain would my soul have been faithful; never an alien pleasure
   Lured me away from the light lit in your luminous eyes,
   But we have altered the World as pitiful man has leisure
   To criticise, balance, take counsel, assuredly lies.All through the centuries Man has gathered his flower, and fenced it,
   --Infinite strife to attain; infinite struggle to keep,--
   Holding his treasure awhile, all Fate and all forces against it,
   Knowing it his no more, if ever his vigilance sleep.But we have altered the World as pitiful man has grown stronger,
   So that the things we love are as easily kept as won,
   Therefore the ancient fight can engage and detain us no longer,
   And all too swiftly, alas, passion is over and done.Far too speedily now we can gather the coveted treasure,
   Enjoy it awhile, be satiated, begin to tire;
   And what shall be done henceforth with the profitless after-leisure,
   Who has the breath to kindle the ash of a faded fire?After my ardent endeavour
   Came the delirious Joy, flooding my life like a sea,
   Days of delight that are burnt on the brain for ever and ever,
   Days and nights when you loved, before you grew weary of me.Softly the sunset decreases dim in the violet Distance,
   Even as Love's own fervour has faded away from me,
   Leaving the weariness, the monotonous Weight of Existence,--
   All the farewells in the world weep in the sound of the sea.Sunstroke

   Oh, straight, white road that runs to meet,
            Across green fields, the blue green sea,
   You knew the little weary feet
            Of my child bride that was to be!Her people brought her from the shore
            One golden day in sultry June,
   And I stood, waiting, at the door,
            Praying my eyes might see her soon.With eager arms, wide open thrown,
            Now never to be satisfied!Ere I could make my love my own
            She closed her amber eyes and died.they took no heed
            How frail she was, my little one,
   But brought her here with cruel speed
            Beneath the fierce, relentless sun.We laid her on the marriage bed
            The bridal flowers in her hand,
   A maiden from the ocean led
            Only, alas!I walk alone; the air is sweet,
            The white road wanders to the sea,
   I dream of those two little feet
            That grew so tired in reaching me.Adoration

   Who does not feel desire unending
     To solace through his daily strife,
   With some mysterious Mental Blending,
     The hungry loneliness of life?Until, by sudden passion shaken,
     As terriers shake a rat at play,
   He finds, all blindly, he has taken
     The old, Hereditary way.Yet, in the moment of communion,
     The very heart of passion's fire,
   His spirit spurns the mortal union,
     "Not this, not this, the Soul's desire!"*        *        *        *

   Oh You, by whom my life is riven,
     And reft away from my control,
   Take back the hours of passion given!Although I once, in ardent fashion,
     Implored you long to give me this;
   (In hopes to stem, or stifle, passion)
     Your hair to touch, your lips to kiss

   Now that your gracious self has granted
     The loveliness you hold as naught,
   I find, alas!not that I wanted--
     Possession has not stifled Thought.Desire its aim has only shifted,--
     Built hopes upon another plan,
   And I in love for you have drifted
     Beyond all passion known to man.Beyond all dreams of soft caresses
     The solacing of any kiss,--
   Beyond the fragrance of your tresses
     (Once I had sold my soul for this!)But now I crave no mortal union
     (Thanks for that sweetness in the past);
   I need some subtle, strange communion,
     Some sense that _I_ join _you_, at last.Long past the pulse and pain of passion,
     Long left the limits of all love,--
   I crave some nearer, fuller fashion,
     Some unknown way, beyond, above,--

   Some infinitely inner fusion,
     As Wave with Water; Flame with Fire,--
   Let me dream once the dear delusion
     That I am You, Oh, Heart's Desire!Your kindness lent to my caresses
     That beauty you so lightly prize,--
   The midnight of your sable tresses,
     The twilight of your shadowed eyes.Ah, for that gift all thanks are given!Yet, Oh, adored, beyond control,
   Count all the passionate past forgiven
     And love me once, once, from your soul.Three Songs of Zahir-u-Din

   The tropic day's redundant charms
     Cool twilight soothes away,
   The sun slips down behind the palms
     And leaves the landscape grey.I want to take you in my arms
           And kiss your lips away!I wake with sunshine in my eyes
     And find the morning blue,
   A night of dreams behind me lies
     And all were dreams of you!Ah, how I wish the while I rise,
           That what I dream were true.The weary day's laborious pace,
     I hasten and beguile
   By fancies, which I backwards trace
     To things I loved erstwhile;
           The weary sweetness of your face,
           Your faint, illusive smile.The silken softness of your hair
     Where faint bronze shadows are,
   Your strangely slight and youthful air,
     No passions seem to mar,--
           Oh, why, since Fate has made you fair,
           Must Fortune keep you far?Thus spent, the day so long and bright
     Less hot and brilliant seems,
   Till in a final flare of light
     The sun withdraws his beams.Then, in the coolness of the night,
           I meet you in my dreams!Second Song

   How much I loved that way you had
   Of smiling most, when very sad,
   A smile which carried tender hints
       Of delicate tints
       And warbling birds,
       Of sun and spring,
   And yet, more than all other thing,
   Of Weariness beyond all Words!None other ever smiled that way,
       None that I know,--
   The essence of all Gaiety lay,
   Of all mad mirth that men may know,
   In that sad smile, serene and slow,
   That on your lips was wont to play.It needed many delicate lines
   And subtle curves and roseate tints
   To make that weary radiant smile;
   It flickered, as beneath the vines
   The sunshine through green shadow glints
   On the pale path that lies below,
   Flickered and flashed, and died away,
   But the strange thoughts it woke meanwhile
       Were wont to stay.Thoughts of Strange Things you used to know
   In dim, dead lives, lived long ago,
   Some madly mirthful Merriment
   Whose lingering light is yet unspent,--
   Some unimaginable Woe,--
   Your strange, sad smile forgets these not,
   Though you, yourself, long since, forgot!Third Song, written during Fever

   To-night the clouds hang very low,
       They take the Hill-tops to their breast,
       And lay their arms about the fields.The wind that fans me lying low,
       Restless with great desire for rest,
       No cooling touch of freshness yields.I, sleepless through the stifling heat,
       Watch the pale Lightning's constant glow
       Between the wide set open doors.I lie and long amidst the heat,--
       The fever that my senses know,
       For that cool slenderness of yours.A roseleaf that has lain in snow,
       A snowflake tinged with sunset fire.You do not know, so young you are,
       How Fever fans the senses' glow
       To uncontrollable desire!And fills the spaces of the night
       With furious and frantic thought,
       One would not dare to think by day.Ah, if you came to me to-night
       These visions would be turned to naught,
       These hateful dreams be held at bay!But you are far, and Loneliness
       My only lover through the night;
       And not for any word or prayer
   Would you console my loneliness
       Or lend yourself, serene and slight,
       And the cool clusters of your hair.All through the night I long for you,
       As shipwrecked men in tropics yearn
       For the fresh flow of streams and springs.My fevered fancies follow you
       As dying men in deserts turn
       Their thoughts to clear and chilly things.Such dreams are mine, and such my thirst,
       Unceasing and unsatisfied,
       Until the night is burnt away
   Among these dreams and fevered thirst,
       And, through the open doorways, glide
       The white feet of the coming day.The Regret of the Ranee in the Hall of Peacocks

   This man has taken my Husband's life
     And laid my Brethren low,
   No sister indeed, were I, no wife,
     To pardon and let him go.Yet why does he look so young and slim
     As he weak and wounded lies?How hard for me to be harsh to him
     With his soft, appealing eyes.His hair is ruffled upon the stone
     And the slender wrists are bound,
   So young!and yet he has overthrown
     His scores on the battle ground.Would I were only a slave to-day,
     To whom it were right and meet
   To wash the stains of the War away,
     The dust from the weary feet.Were I but one of my serving girls
     To solace his pain to rest!Shake out the sand from the soft loose curls,
     And hold him against my breast!Would God that I were the senseless stone
     To support his slender length!I hate those wounds that trouble my sight,
     Unknown!how I wish you lay,
   Alone in my silken tent to-night
     While I charmed the pain away.I would lay you down on the Royal bed,
     I would bathe your wounds with wine,
   And setting your feet against my head
     Dream you were lover of mine.My Crown is heavy upon my hair,
     The Jewels weigh on my breast,
   All I would leave, with delight, to share
     Your pale and passionate rest!But hands grow restless about their swords,
     Lips murmur below their breath,
   "The Queen is silent too long!""My Lords,
     --Take him away to death!"Protest: By Zahir-u-Din

   Alas!this wasted Night
   With all its Jasmin-scented air,
   Its thousand stars, serenely bright!I lie alone, and long for you,
   Long for your Champa-scented hair,
   Your tranquil eyes of twilight hue;

   Long for the close-curved, delicate lips
   --Their sinuous sweetness laid on mine--
   Here, where the slender fountain drips,
   Here, where the yellow roses glow,
   Pale in the tender silver shine
   The stars across the garden throw.The poets hardly speak the truth,--
   Despite their praiseful litany,
   His season is not all delights
   Nor every night an ecstasy!The very power and passion that make--
   _Might_ make--his days one golden dream,
   How he must suffer for their sake!Till, in their fierce and futile rage,
   The baffled senses almost deem
   They might be happier in old age.Age that can find red roses sweet,
   And yet not crave a rose-red mouth;
   Hear Bulbuls, with no wish that feet
   Of sweeter singers went his way;
   Inhale warm breezes from the South,
   Yet never fed his fancy stray.From some near Village I can hear
   The cadenced throbbing of a drum,
   Now softly distant, now more near;
   And in an almost human fashion,
   It, plaintive, wistful, seems to come
   Laden with sighs of fitful passion,

   To mock me, lying here alone
   Among the thousand useless flowers
   Upon the fountain's border-stone--
   Cold stone, that chills me as I lie
   Counting the slowly passing hours
   By the white spangles in the sky.Some feast the Tom-toms celebrate,
   Where, close together, side by side,
   Gay in their gauze and tinsel state
   With lips serene and downcast eyes,
   Sit the young bridegroom and his bride,
   While round them songs and laughter rise.They are together; Why are we
   So hopelessly, so far apart?Oh, I implore you, come to me!Come to me, Solace of mine eyes!A little, languid, mocking breeze
   That rustles through the Jasmin flowers
   And stirs among the Tamarind trees;
   A little gurgle of the spray
   That drips, unheard, though silent hours,
   Then breaks in sudden bubbling play.Why, therefore, mock at my repose?Is it my fault I am alone
   Beneath the feathery Tamarind tree
   Whose shadows over me are thrown?Nay, I am mad indeed, with thirst
   For all to me this night denied
   And drunk with longing, and accurst
   Beyond all chance of sleep or rest,
   With love, unslaked, unsatisfied,
   And dreams of beauty unpossessed.Hating the hour that brings you not,
   Mad at the space betwixt us twain,
   Sad for my empty arms, so hot
   And fevered, even the chilly stone
   Can scarcely cool their burning pain,--
   And oh, this sense of being alone!Take hence, O Night, your wasted hours,
   You bring me not my Life's Delight,
   My Star of Stars, my Flower of Flowers!You leave me loveless and forlorn,
   Pass on, most false and futile night,
   Pass on, and perish in the Dawn!Famine Song

   Death and Famine on every side
       And never a sign of rain,
   The bones of those who have starved and died
       Unburied upon the plain.What care have I that the bones bleach white?To-morrow they may be mine,
   But I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And drink your lips like wine!Cholera, Riot, and Sudden Death,
       And the brave red blood set free,
   The glazing eye and the failing breath,--
       But what are these things to me?Your breath is quick and your eyes are bright
       And your blood is red like wine,
   And I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And hold your lips with mine!I hear the sound of a thousand tears,
       Like softly pattering rain,
   I see the fever, folly, and fears
       Fulfilling man's tale of pain.But for the moment your star is bright,
       I revel beneath its shine,
   For I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And feel your lips on mine!And you need not deem me over cold,
       That I do not stop to think
   For all the pleasure this Life may hold
       Is on the Precipice brink.Thought could but lessen my soul's delight,
       And to-day she may not pine.For I shall lie in your arms to-night
       And close your lips with mine!I trust what sorrow the Fates may send
       I may carry quietly through,
   And pray for grace when I reach the end,
       To die as a man should do.To-day, at least, must be clear and bright,
       Without a sorrowful sign,
   Because I sleep in your arms to-night
       And feel your lips on mine!So on I work, in the blazing sun,
       To bury what dead we may,
   But glad, oh, glad, when the day is done
       And the night falls round us grey.Would those we covered away from sight
       Had a rest as sweet as mine!For I shall sleep in your arms to-night
       And drink your lips like wine!The Window Overlooking the Harbour

   Sad is the Evening: all the level sand
     Lies left and lonely, while the restless sea,
   Tired of the green caresses of the land,
     Withdraws into its own infinity.But still more sad this white and chilly Dawn
     Filling the vacant spaces of the sky,
   While little winds blow here and there forlorn
     And all the stars, weary of shining, die.And more than desolate, to wake, to rise,
     Leaving the couch, where softly sleeping still,
   What through the past night made my heaven, lies;
     And looking out across the window sill

   See, from the upper window's vantage ground,
     Mankind slip into harness once again,
   And wearily resume his daily round
     Of love and labour, toil and strife and pain.How the sad thoughts slip back across the night:
     The whole thing seems so aimless and so vain.What use the raptures, passion and delight,
     Burnt out; as though they could not wake again.The worn-out nerves and weary brain repeat
     The question: Whither all these passions tend;--
   This curious thirst, so painful and so sweet,
     So fierce, so very short-lived, to what end?Even, if seeking for ourselves, the Race,
     The only immortality we know,--
   Even if from the flower of our embrace
     Some spark should kindle, or some fruit should grow,

   What were the use?the gain, to us or it,
     That we should cause another You or Me,--
   Another life, from our light passion lit,
     To suffer like ourselves awhile and die.Our being runs
     In a closed circle.All we know or see
   Tends to assure us that a thousand Suns,
     Teeming perchance with life, have ceased to be.Ah, the grey Dawn seems more than desolate,
     And the past night of passion worse than waste,
   Love but a useless flower, that soon or late,
     Turns to a fruit with bitter aftertaste.Youth, even Youth, seems futile and forlorn
     While the new day grows slowly white above.Pale and reproachful comes the chilly Dawn
     After the fervour of a night of love.Back to the Border

   The tremulous morning is breaking
     Against the white waste of the sky,
   And hundreds of birds are awaking
     In tamarisk bushes hard by.I, waiting alone in the station,
     Can hear in the distance, grey-blue,
   The sound of that iron desolation,
     The train that will bear me from you.'T will carry me under your casement,
     You'll feel in your dreams as you lie
   The quiver, from gable to basement,
     The rush of my train sweeping by.And I shall look out as I pass it,--
     Your dear, unforgettable door,
   'T was _ours_ till last night, but alas!it
     Will never be mine any more.Through twilight blue-grey and uncertain,
     Where frost leaves the window-pane free,
   I'll look at the tinsel-edged curtain
     That hid so much pleasure for me.I go to my long undone duty
     Alone in the chill and the gloom,
   My eyes are still full of the beauty
     I leave in your rose-scented room.Lie still in your dreams; for your tresses
     Are free of my lingering kiss.I keep you awake with caresses
     No longer; be happy in this!From passion you told me you hated
     You're now and for ever set free,
   I pass in my train, sorrow-weighted,
     Your house that was Heaven to me.You won't find a trace, when you waken,
     Of me or my love of the past,
   Rise up and rejoice!I have taken
     My longed-for departure at last.My fervent and useless persistence
     You never need suffer again,
   Nor even perceive in the distance
     The smoke of my vanishing train!Reverie: Zahir-u-Din

   Alone, I wait, till her twilight gate
                        The Night slips quietly through,
   With shadow and gloom, and purple bloom,
                        Flung over the Zenith blue.Her stars that tremble, would fain dissemble
                        Light over lovers thrown,--
   Her hush and mystery know no history
                        Such as day may own.Day has record of pleasure and pain,
   But things that are done by Night remain
                        For ever and ever unknown.For a thousand years, 'neath a thousand skies,
                        Night has brought men love;
   Therefore the old, old longings rise
                        As the light grows dim above.Therefore, now that the shadows close,
                        And the mists weird and white,
   While Time is scented with musk and rose;
                        Magic with silver light.I long for love; will you grant me some?as lovers have always come,
                        Through the evenings of the Past.Swiftly, as lovers have always come,
   Softly, as lovers have always come
                        Through the long-forgotten Past.Sea Song

   Against the planks of the cabin side,
       (So slight a thing between them and me,)
   The great waves thundered and throbbed and sighed,
       The great green waves of the Indian sea!Your face was white as the foam is white,
       Your hair was curled as the waves are curled,
   I would we had steamed and reached that night
       The sea's last edge, the end of the world.The wind blew in through the open port,
       So freshly joyous and salt and free,
   Your hair it lifted, your lips it sought,
       And then swept back to the open sea.The engines throbbed with their constant beat;
       Your heart was nearer, and all I heard;
   Your lips were salt, but I found them sweet,
       While, acquiescent, you spoke no word.So straight you lay in your narrow berth,
       Rocked by the waves; and you seemed to be
   Essence of all that is sweet on earth,
       Of all that is sad and strange at sea.And you were white as the foam is white,
       Your hair was curled as the waves are curled.had we but sailed and reached that night,
       The sea's last edge, the end of the world!'T is eight miles out and eight miles in,
        Just at the break of morn.'T is ice without and flame within,
        To gain a kiss at dawn!Far, where the Lilac Hills arise
        Soft from the misty plain,
   A lone enchanted hollow lies
        Where I at last drew rein.Midwinter grips this lonely land,
        This stony, treeless waste,
   Where East, due East, across the sand,
        We fly in fevered haste.the East will soon be red,
        The wild duck westward fly,
   And make above my anxious head,
        Triangles in the sky.Like wind we go; we both are still
        So young; all thanks to Fate!(It cuts like knives, this air so chill,)
        Dear God!Behind us, wrapped in mist and sleep
        The Ruined City lies,
   (Although we race, we seem to creep!)Eight miles out only, eight miles in,
        Good going all the way;
   But more and more the clouds begin
        To redden into day.And every snow-tipped peak grows pink
        An iridescent gem!My heart beats quick, with joy, to think
        How I am nearing them!As mile on mile behind us falls,
        Till, Oh, delight!I see
   My Heart's Desire, who softly calls
        Across the gloom to me.The utter joy of that First Love
        No later love has given,
   When, while the skies grew light above,
        We entered into Heaven.Till I Wake

   When I am dying, lean over me tenderly, softly,
     Stoop, as the yellow roses droop in the wind from the South.So I may, when I wake, if there be an Awakening,
     Keep, what lulled me to sleep, the touch of your lips on my mouth.His Rubies: Told by Valgovind

   Along the hot and endless road,
     Calm and erect, with haggard eyes,
   The prisoner bore his fetters' load
     Beneath the scorching, azure skies.Serene and tall, with brows unbent,
     Without a hope, without a friend,
   He, under escort, onward went,
     With death to meet him at the end.The Poppy fields were pink and gay
     On either side, and in the heat
   Their drowsy scent exhaled all day
     A dream-like fragrance almost sweet.And when the cool of evening fell
     And tender colours touched the sky,
   He still felt youth within him dwell
     And half forgot he had to die.Sometimes at night, the Camp-fires lit
     And casting fitful light around,
   His guard would, friend-like, let him sit
     And talk awhile with them, unbound.Thus they, the night before the last,
     Were resting, when a group of girls
   Across the small encampment passed,
     With laughing lips and scented curls.Then in the Prisoner's weary eyes
     A sudden light lit up once more,
   The women saw him with surprise,
     And pity for the chains he bore.For little women reck of Crime
     If young and fair the criminal be
   Here in this tropic, amorous clime
     Where love is still untamed and free.And one there was, she walked less fast,
     Behind the rest, perhaps beguiled
   By his lithe form, who, as she passed,
     Waited a little while, and smiled.The guard, in kindly Eastern fashion,
     Smiled to themselves, and let her stay.So tolerant of human passion,
     "To love he has but one more day."Yet when (the soft and scented gloom
     Scarce lighted by the dying fire)
   His arms caressed her youth and bloom,
     With him it was not all desire."For me," he whispered, as he lay,
     "But little life remains to live.One thing I crave to take away:
     You have the gift; but will you give?"If I could know some child of mine
     Would live his life, and see the sun
   Across these fields of poppies shine,
     What should I care that mine is done?"To die would not be dying quite,
     Leaving a little life behind,
   You, were you kind to me to-night,
     Could grant me this; but--are you kind?"See, I have something here for you
     For you and It, if It there be."Soft in the gloom her glances grew,
     With gentle tears he could not see.He took the chain from off his neck,
     Hid in the silver chain there lay
   Three rubies, without flaw or fleck.He drew her close; the moonless skies
     Shed little light; the fire was dead.Soft pity filled her youthful eyes,
     And many tender things she said.Throughout the hot and silent night
     All that he asked of her she gave.And, left alone ere morning light,
     He went serenely to the grave,

   Happy; for even when the rope
     Confined his neck, his thoughts were free,
   And centered round his Secret Hope
     The little life that was to be.When Poppies bloomed again, she bore
     His child who gaily laughed and crowed,
   While round his tiny neck he wore
     The rubies given on the road.For his small sake she wished to wait,
     But vainly to forget she tried,
   And grieving for the Prisoner's fate,
     She broke her gentle heart and died.Song of Taj Mahomed

   Dear is my inlaid sword; across the Border
   It brought me much reward; dear is my Mistress,
   The jewelled treasure of an amorous hour.Dear beyond measure are my dreams and Fancies.These I adore; for these I live and labour,
   Holding them more than sword or jewelled Mistress,
   For this indeed may rust, and that prove faithless,
   But, till my limbs are dust, I have my Fancies.The Garden of Kama:

   Kama the Indian Eros

   The daylight is dying,
   The Flying fox flying,
         Amber and amethyst burn in the sky.See, the sun throws a late,
   Lingering, roseate
         Kiss to the landscape to bid it good-bye.Oh, come, unresisting,
         Lovely, expectant, on tentative feet.Shadow shall cover us,
   Roses bend over us,
         Making a bride chamber, sacred and sweet.We know not life's reason,
   The length of its season,
         Know not if they know, the great Ones above.We none of us sought it,
   And few could support it,
         Were it not gilt with the glamour of love.But much is forgiven
   To Gods who have given,
         If but for an hour, the Rapture of Youth.You do not yet know it,
   But Kama shall show it,
         Changing your dreams to his Exquisite Truth.The Fireflies shall light you,
   And naught shall afright you,
         Nothing shall trouble the Flight of the Hours.Come, for I wait for you,
   Night is too late for you,
         Come, while the twilight is closing the flowers.Every breeze still is,
   And, scented with lilies,
         Cooled by the twilight, refreshed by the dew,
   The garden lies breathless,
   Where Kama, the Deathless,
         In the hushed starlight, is waiting for you.Camp Follower's Song, Gomal River

   We have left Gul Kach behind us,
      Are marching on Apozai,--
   Where pleasure and rest are waiting
      To welcome us by and by.We're falling back from the Gomal,
      Across the Gir-dao plain,
   The camping ground is deserted,
      We'll never come back again.Along the rocks and the defiles,
      The mules and the camels wind.Good-bye to Rahimut-Ullah,
      The man who is left behind.For some we lost in the skirmish,
      And some were killed in the fight,
   But he was captured by fever,
      In the sentry pit, at night.A rifle shot had been swifter,
      Less trouble a sabre thrust,
   But his Fate decided fever,
      And each man dies as he must.The wavering flames rise high,
   The flames of our burning grass-huts,
      Against the black of the sky.We hear the sound of the river,
      An ever-lessening moan,
   The hearts of us all turn backwards
      To where he is left alone.We sing up a little louder,
      We know that we feel bereft,
   We're leaving the camp together,
      And only one of us left.The only one, out of many,
      And each must come to his end,
   I wish I could stop this singing,
      He happened to be my friend.We're falling back from the Gomal
      We're marching on Apozai,
   And pleasure and rest are waiting
      To welcome us by and by.Perhaps the feast will taste bitter,
      The lips of the girls less kind,--
   Because of Rahimut-Ullah,
      The man who is left behind!Song of the Colours: by Taj Mahomed

   _Rose-colour_
   Rose Pink am I, the colour gleams and glows
     In many a flower; her lips, those tender doors
   By which, in time of love, love's essence flows
     From him to her, are dyed in delicate Rose.Mine is the earliest Ruby light that pours
     Out of the East, when day's white gates unclose.On downy peach, and maiden's downier cheek
     I, in a flush of radiant bloom, alight,
   Clinging, at sunset, to the shimmering peak
     I veil its snow in floods of Roseate light._Azure_
   Mine is the heavenly hue of Azure skies,
     Where the white clouds lie soft as seraphs' wings,
   Mine the sweet, shadowed light in innocent eyes,
     Whose lovely looks light only on lovely things.Mine the Blue Distance, delicate and clear,
     Mine the Blue Glory of the morning sea,
   All that the soul so longs for, finds not here,
     Fond eyes deceive themselves, and find in me.to the Royal Red of living Blood,
     Let loose by steel in spirit-freeing flood,
   Forced from faint forms, by toil or torture torn
     Staining the patient gates of life new born.Colour of War and Rage, of Pomp and Show,
     Banners that flash, red flags that flaunt and glow,
   Colour of Carnage, Glory, also Shame,
     Raiment of women women may not name.I hide in mines, where unborn Rubies dwell,
     Flicker and flare in fitful fire in Hell,
   The outpressed life-blood of the grape is mine,
     Hail!Strong am I, over strong, to eyes that tire,
     In the hot hue of Rapine, Riot, Flame.Death and Despair are black, War and Desire,
     The two red cards in Life's unequal game._Green_
   I am the Life of Forests, and Wandering Streams,
     Green as the feathery reeds the Florican love,
   Young as a maiden, who of her marriage dreams,
     Still sweetly inexperienced in ways of Love.Colour of Youth and Hope, some waves are mine,
     Some emerald reaches of the evening sky.See, in the Spring, my sweet green Promise shine,
     Never to be fulfilled, of by and by.Never to be fulfilled; leaves bud, and ever
     Something is wanting, something falls behind;
   The flowered Solstice comes indeed, but never
     That light and lovely summer men divined._Violet_
   I were the colour of Things, (if hue they had)
         That are hard to name.Of curious, twisted thoughts that men call "mad"
         Or oftener "shame."Of that delicate vice, that is hardly vice,
         So reticent, rare,
   Ethereal, as the scent of buds and spice,
         In this Eastern air.On palm-fringed shores I colour the Cowrie shell,
         With its edges curled;
   And, deep in Datura poison buds, I dwell
         In a perfumed world.My lilac tinges the edge of the evening sky
         Where the sunset clings.My purple lends an Imperial Majesty
         To the robes of kings._Yellow_
   Gold am I, and for me, ever men curse and pray,
     Selling their souls and each other, by night and day.A sordid colour, and yet, I make some things fair,
     Dying sunsets, fields of corn, and a maiden's hair.Thus they discoursed in the daytime,--Violet, Yellow, and Blue,
     Emerald, Scarlet, and Rose-colour, the pink and perfect hue.Thus they spoke in the sunshine, when their beauty was manifest,
     Till the Night came, and the Silence, and gave them an equal rest.Lalila, to the Ferengi Lover

   Why above others was I so blessed
      And honoured?to be chosen one
   To hold you, sleeping, against my breast,
      As now I may hold your only son.You gave your life to me in a kiss;
   Have I done well, for that past delight,
      In return, to have given you this?Look down at his face, your face, beloved,
      His eyes are azure as yours are blue.In every line of his form is proved
      How well I loved you, and only you.I felt the secret hope at my heart
      Turned suddenly to the living joy,
   And knew that your life and mine had part
      As golden grains in a brass alloy.And learning thus, that your child was mine,
      Thrilled by the sense of its stirring life,
   I held myself as a sacred shrine
      Afar from pleasure, and pain, and strife,

   That all unworthy I might not be
      Of that you had deigned to cause to dwell
   Hidden away in the heart of me,
      As white pearls hide in a dusky shell.Do you remember, when first you laid
      Your lips on mine, that enchanted night?My eyes were timid, my lips afraid,
      You seemed so slender and strangely white.I always tremble; the moments flew
      Swiftly to dawn that took you away,
   But this is a small and lovely you
      Content to rest in my arms all day.Oh, since you have sought me, Lord, for this,
      And given your only child to me,
   My life devoted to yours and his,
      Whilst I am living, will always be.And after death, through the long To Be,
      (Which, I think, must surely keep love's laws,)
   I, should you chance to have need of me,
      Am ever and always, only yours.On the City Wall

   Upon the City Ramparts, lit up by sunset gleam,
   The Blue eyes that conquer, meet the Darker eyes that dream.The Dark eyes, so Eastern, and the Blue eyes from the West,
   The last alight with action, the first so full of rest.Brown, that seem to hold the Past; its magic mystery,
   Blue, that catch the early light, of ages yet to be.Meet and fall and meet again, then linger, look, and smile,
   Time and distance all forgotten, for a little while.Happy on the city wall, in the warm spring weather,
   All the force of Nature's laws, drawing them together.East and West so gaily blending, for a little space,
   All the sunshine seems to centre, round th' Enchanted place!One rides down the dusty road, one watches from the wall,
   Azure eyes would fain return, and Amber eyes recall;

   Would fain be on the ramparts, and resting heart to heart,
   But time o' love is overpast, East and West must part.Those are dim, and ride away, these cry themselves to sleep._"Oh, since Love is all so short, the sob so near the smile,_
   _Blue eyes that always conquer us, is it worth your while?"_





"Love Lightly"

   There were Roses in the hedges, and Sunshine in the sky,
   Red Lilies in the sedges, where the water rippled by,
   A thousand Bulbuls singing, oh, how jubilant they were,
   And a thousand flowers flinging their sweetness on the air.But you, who sat beside me, had a shadow in your eyes,
   Their sadness seemed to chide me, when I gave you scant replies;
   You asked "Did I remember?"In vain you fanned the ember, for the love flame was not there."And so, since you are tired of me, you ask me to forget,
     What is the use of caring, now that you no longer care?When Love is dead his Memory can only bring regret,
     But how can I forget you with the flowers in your hair?"What use the scented Roses, or the azure of the sky?They are sweet when Love reposes, but then he had to die.What could I do in leaving you, but ask you to forget,--
   I suffered, too, in grieving you; I all but loved you yet.But half love is a treason, that no lover can forgive,
   I had loved you for a season, I had no more to give.You saw my passion faltered, for I could but let you see,
   And it was not I that altered, but Fate that altered me.And so, since I am tired of love, I ask you to forget,
     What is the use you caring, now that I no longer care?When Love is dead, his Memory can only bring regret;
     Forget me, oh, forget me, and my flower-scented hair!No Rival Like the Past

   As those who eat a Luscious Fruit, sunbaked,
     Full of sweet juice, with zest, until they find
   It finished, and their appetite unslaked,
     And so return and eat the pared-off rind;--

   We, who in Youth, set white and careless teeth
     In the Ripe Fruits of Pleasure while they last,
   Later, creep back to gnaw the cast-off sheath,
     And find there is no Rival like the Past.Verse by Taj Mahomed

   When first I loved, I gave my very soul
   Utterly unreserved to Love's control,
   But Love deceived me, wrenched my youth away
   And made the gold of life for ever grey.Long I lived lonely, yet I tried in vain
   With any other Joy to stifle pain;
   There _is_ no other joy, I learned to know,
   And so returned to Love, as long ago.Yet I, this little while ere I go hence,
   Love very lightly now, in self-defence.Lines by Taj Mahomed

   This passion is but an ember
     Of a Sun, of a Fire, long set;
   I could not live and remember,
     And so I love and forget.You say, and the tone is fretful,
     That my mourning days were few,
   You call me over forgetful--
     My God, if you only knew!There is no Breeze to Cool the Heat of Love

   The listless Palm-trees catch the breeze above
     The pile-built huts that edge the salt Lagoon,
   There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love,
     No wind from land or sea, at night or noon.Perfumed and robed I wait, my Lord, for you,
     And my heart waits alert, with strained delight,
   My flowers are loath to close, as though they knew
     That you will come to me before the night.In the Verandah all the lights are lit,
     And softly veiled in rose to please your eyes,
   Between the pillars flying foxes flit,
     Their wings transparent on the lilac skies.Come soon, my Lord, come soon, I almost fear
     My heart may fail me in this keen suspense,
   Break with delight, at last, to know you near.Pleasure is one with Pain, if too intense.I envy these: the steps that you will tread,
     The jasmin that will touch you by its leaves,
   When, in your slender height, you stoop your head
     At the low door beneath the palm-thatched eaves.For though you utterly belong to me,
     And love has done his utmost 'twixt us twain,
   Your slightest, careless touch yet seems to be
     That keen delight so much akin to pain.The night breeze blows across the still Lagoon,
     And stirs the Palm-trees till they wave above
   Our pile-built huts; Oh, come, my Lord, come soon,
     There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love.Every time you give yourself to me,
     The gift seems greater, and yourself more fair,
   This slight-built, palm-thatched hut has come to be
     A temple, since, my Lord, you visit there.And as the water, gurgling softly, goes
     Among the piles beneath the slender floor;
   I hear it murmur, as it seaward flows,
     Of the great Wonder seen upon the shore.The Miracle, that you should come to me,
     Whom the whole world, seeing, can but desire,
   It is as though some White Star stooped to be
     The messmate of our little cooking fire.Leaving the Glory of his Purple Skies,
     And the White Friendship of the Crescent Moon,
   And yet;--I look into your brilliant eyes,
     And find content; Oh, come, my Lord, come soon.Perfumed and robed I wait for you, I wait,
     The flowers that please you wreathed about my hair,
   And this poor face set forth in jewelled state,
     So more than proud since you have found it fair.My lute is ready, and the fragrant drink
     Your lips may honour, how it will rejoice
   Losing its life in yours!the lute I think
     But wastes the time when I might hear your voice.Your slightest, as your utmost, wish or will,
   Whether it please you to caress or slay,
     It would please me to give obedience still.I would delight to die beneath your kiss;
     I envy that young maiden who was slain,
   So her warm blood, flowing beneath the kiss,
     Might ease the wounded Sultan of his pain--

   If she loved him as I love you, my Lord.There is no pleasure on the earth so sweet
   As is the pain endured for one adored;
     If I lay crushed beneath your slender feet

   I should be happy!Ah, come soon, come soon,
     See how the stars grow large and white above,
   The land breeze blows across the salt Lagoon,
     There is no Breeze to cool the heat of love.Malay Song

   The Stars await, serene and white,
     The unarisen moon;
   Oh, come and stay with me to-night,
     Beside the salt Lagoon!My hut is small, but as you lie,
     You see the lighted shore,
   And hear the rippling water sigh
     Beneath the pile-raised floor.No gift have I of jewels or flowers,
     My room is poor and bare:
   But all the silver sea is ours,
     And all the scented air

   Blown from the mainland, where there grows
     Th' "Intriguer of the Night,"
   The flower that you have named Tube rose,
     Sweet scented, slim, and white.The flower that, when the air is still
     And no land breezes blow,
   From its pale petals can distil
     A phosphorescent glow.I see your ship at anchor ride;
     Her "captive lightning" shine.Before she takes to-morrow's tide,
     Let this one night be mine!Though in the language of your land
     My words are poor and few,
   Oh, read my eyes, and understand,
     I give my youth to you!The Temple Dancing Girl

   You will be mine; those lightly dancing feet,
     Falling as softly on the careless street
   As the wind-loosened petals of a flower,
     Will bring you here, at the Appointed Hour.And all the Temple's little links and laws
     Will not for long protect your loveliness.I have a stronger force to aid my cause,
     Nature's great Law, to love and to possess!Throughout those sleepless watches, when I lay
     Wakeful, desiring what I might not see,
   I knew (it helped those hours, from dusk to day),
     In this one thing, Fate would be kind to me.You will consent, through all my veins like wine
     This prescience flows; your lips meet mine above,
   Your clear soft eyes look upward into mine
     Dim in a silent ecstasy of love.The clustered softness of your waving hair,
     That curious paleness which enchants me so,
   And all your delicate strength and youthful air,
     Destiny will compel you to bestow!Refuse, withdraw, and hesitate awhile,
     Your young reluctance does but fan the flame;
   My partner, Love, waits, with a tender smile,
     Who play against him play a losing game.I, strong in nothing else, have strength in this,
     The subtlest, most resistless, force we know
   Is aiding me; and you must stoop and kiss:
     The genius of the race will have it so!Yet, make it not too long, nor too intense
     My thirst; lest I should break beneath the strain,
   And the worn nerves, and over-wearied sense,
     Enjoy not what they spent themselves to gain.Lest, in the hour when you consent to share
     That human passion Beauty makes divine,
   I, over worn, should find you over fair,
     Lest I should die before I make you mine.You will consent, those slim, reluctant feet,
     Falling as lightly on the careless street
   As the white petals of a wind-worn flower,
     Will bring you here, at the Appointed Hour.Hira-Singh's Farewell to Burmah

   On the wooden deck of the wooden Junk, silent, alone, we lie,
   With silver foam about the bow, and a silver moon in the sky:
   A glimmer of dimmer silver here, from the anklets round your feet,
   Our lips may close on each other's lips, but never our souls may meet.For though in my arms you lie at rest, your name I have never heard,
   To carry a thought between us two, we have not a single word.And yet what matter we do not speak, when the ardent eyes have spoken,
   The way of love is a sweeter way, when the silence is unbroken.As a wayward Fancy, tired at times, of the cultured Damask Rose,
   Drifts away to the tangled copse, where the wild Anemone grows;
   So the ordered and licit love ashore, is hardly fresh and free
   As this light love in the open wind and salt of the outer sea.So sweet you are, with your tinted cheeks and your small caressive hands,
   What if I carried you home with me, where our Golden Temple stands?Yet, this were folly indeed; to bind, in fetters of permanence,
   A passing dream whose enchantment charms because of its trancience.Life is ever a slave to Time; we have but an hour to rest,
   Her steam is up and her lighters leave, the vessel that takes me west;
   And never again we two shall meet, as we chance to meet to-night,
   On the Junk, whose painted eyes gaze forth, in desolate want of sight.And what is love at its best, but this?Conceived by a passing glance,
   Nursed and reared in a transient mood, on a drifting Sea of Chance.For rudderless craft are all our loves, among the rocks and the shoals,
   Well we may know one another's speech, but never each other's souls.Give here your lips and kiss me again, we have but a moment more,
   Before we set the sail to the mast, before we loosen the oar.Good-bye to you, and my thanks to you, for the rest you let me share,
   While this night drifted away to the Past, to join the Nights that Were.Starlight

   O beautiful Stars, when you see me go
     Hither and thither, in search of love,
   Do you think me faithless, who gleam and glow
     Serene and fixed in the blue above?O Stars, so golden, it is not so.But there is a garden I dare not see,
     There is a place where I fear to go,
   Since the charm and glory of life to me
     The brown earth covered there, long ago.O Stars, you saw it, you know, you know.Hither and thither I wandering go,
     With aimless haste and wearying fret;
   In a search for pleasure and love?Not so,
     Seeking desperately to forget.You see so many, O Stars, you know.Sampan Song

   A little breeze blew over the sea,
       And it came from far away,
   Across the fields of millet and rice,
   All warm with sunshine and sweet with spice,
   It lifted his curls and kissed him thrice,
       As upon the deck he lay.It said, "Oh, idle upon the sea,
       Awake and with sleep have done,
   Haul up the widest sail of the prow,
   And come with me to the rice fields now,
   She longs, oh, how can I tell you how,
       To show you your first-born son!"Song of the Devoted Slave

   There is one God: Mahomed his Prophet.Had I his power
   I would take the topmost peaks of the snow-clad Himalayas,
   And would range them around your dwelling, during the heats of summer,
   To cool the airs that fan your serene and delicate presence,
                   Had I the power.Your courtyard should ever be filled with the fleetest of camels
   Laden with inlaid armour, jewels and trappings for horses,
   Ripe dates from Egypt, and spices and musk from Arabia.And the sacred waters of Zem-Zem well, transported thither,
   Should bubble and flow in your chamber, to bathe the delicate
   Slender and wayworn feet of my Lord, returning from travel,
                   Had I the power.Fine woven silk, from the further East, should conceal your beauty,
   Clinging around you in amorous folds; caressive, silken,
   Beautiful long-lashed, sweet-voiced Persian boys should, kneeling, serve you,
   And the floor beneath your sandalled feet should be smooth and golden,
                   Had I the power.And if ever your clear and stately thoughts should turn to women,
   Kings' daughters, maidens, should be appointed to your caresses,
   That the youth and the strength of my Lord might never be wasted
   In light or sterile love; but enrich the world with his children.Whilst I should sit in the outer court of the Water Palace
   To await the time when you went forth, for Pleasure or Warfare,
   Descending the stairs rose crowned, or armed and arrayed in purple,--
   To mark the place where your steps have fallen, and kiss the footprints,
                   Had I the power.The Singer

   The singer only sang the Joy of Life,
     For all too well, alas!the singer knew
   How hard the daily toil, how keen the strife,
     How salt the falling tear; the joys how few.He who thinks hard soon finds it hard to live,
     Learning the Secret Bitterness of Things:
   So, leaving thought, the singer strove to give
     A level lightness to his lyric strings.He only sang of Love; its joy and pain,
     But each man in his early season loves;
   Each finds the old, lost Paradise again,
     Unfolding leaves, and roses, nesting doves.And though that sunlit time flies all too fleetly,
     Delightful Days that dance away too soon!Its early morning freshness lingers sweetly
     Throughout life's grey and tedious afternoon.And he, whose dreams enshrine her tender eyes,
     And she, whose senses wait his waking hand,
   Impatient youth, that tired but sleepless lies,
     Will read perhaps, and reading, understand.Oh, roseate lips he would have loved to kiss,
     Oh, eager lovers that he never knew!What should you know of him, or words of his?--
     But all the songs he sang were sung for you!Malaria

   He lurks among the reeds, beside the marsh,
     Red oleanders twisted in His hair,
   His eyes are haggard and His lips are harsh,
     Upon His breast the bones show gaunt and bare.The green and stagnant waters lick His feet,
     And from their filmy, iridescent scum
   Clouds of mosquitoes, gauzy in the heat,
     Rise with His gifts: Death and Delirium.His messengers: They bear the deadly taint
     On spangled wings aloft and far away,
   Making thin music, strident and yet faint,
     From golden eve to silver break of day.The baffled sleeper hears th' incessant whine
     Through his tormented dreams, and finds no rest
   The thirsty insects use his blood for wine,
     Probe his blue veins and pasture on his breast.While far away He in the marshes lies,
     Staining the stagnant water with His breath,
   An endless hunger burning in His eyes,
     A famine unassuaged, whose food is Death.He hides among the ghostly mists that float
     Over the water, weird and white and chill,
   And peasants, passing in their laden boat,
     Shiver and feel a sense of coming ill.A thousand burn and die; He takes no heed,
     Their bones, unburied, strewn upon the plain,
   Only increase the frenzy of His greed
     To add more victims to th' already slain.He loves the haggard frame, the shattered mind,
     Gloats with delight upon the glazing eye,
   Yet, in one thing, His cruelty is kind,
     He sends them lovely dreams before they die;

   Dreams that bestow on them their heart's desire,
     Visions that find them mad, and leave them blest,
   To sink, forgetful of the fever's fire,
     Softly, as in a lover's arms, to rest.Fancy

   Far in the Further East the skilful craftsman
       Fashioned this fancy for the West's delight.This rose and azure Dragon, crouching softly
       Upon the satin skin, close-grained and white.And you lay silent, while his slender needles
       Pricked the intricate pattern on your arm,
   Combining deftly Cruelty and Beauty,
       That subtle union, whose child is charm.Charm irresistible: the lovely something
       We follow in our dreams, but may not reach.The unattainable Divine Enchantment,
       Hinted in music, never heard in speech.This from the blue design exhales towards me,
       As incense rises from the Homes of Prayer,
   While the unfettered eyes, allured and rested,
       Urge the forbidden lips to stoop and share;

   Share in the sweetness of the rose and azure
       Traced in the Dragon's form upon the white
   Curve of the arm.Ah, curb thyself, my fancy,
       Where would'st thou drift in this enchanted flight?Feroza

   The evening sky was as green as Jade,
      As Emerald turf by Lotus lake,
   Behind the Kafila far she strayed,
      (The Pearls are lost if the Necklace break!)A lingering freshness touched the air
      From palm-trees, clustered around a Spring,
   The great, grim Desert lay vast and bare,
      But Youth is ever a careless thing.The Raiders threw her upon the sand,
      Men of the Wilderness know no laws,
   They tore the Amethysts off her hand,
      And rent the folds of her veiling gauze.They struck the lips that they might have kissed,
      Pitiless they to her pain and fear,
   And wrenched the gold from her broken wrist,
      No use to cry; there were none to hear.Her scarlet mouth and her onyx eyes,
      Her braided hair in its silken sheen,
   Were surely meet for a Lover's prize,
      But Fate dissented, and stepped between.Across the Zenith the vultures fly,
      Cruel of beak and heavy of wing.This Month the Almonds Bloom at Kandahar

   I hate this City, seated on the Plain,
     The clang and clamour of the hot Bazar,
   Knowing, amid the pauses of my pain,
     This month the Almonds bloom in Kandahar.The Almond-trees, that sheltered my Delight,
     Screening my happiness as evening fell.It was well worth--that most Enchanted Night--
     This life in torment, and the next in Hell!People are kind to me; one More than Kind,
     Her lashes lie like fans upon her cheek,
   But kindness is a burden on my mind,
     And it is weariness to hear her speak.For though that Kaffir's bullet holds me here,
     My thoughts are ever free, and wander far,
   To where the Lilac Hills rise, soft and clear,
     Beyond the Almond Groves of Kandahar.He followed me to Sibi, to the Fair,
     The Horse-fair, where he shot me weeks ago,
   But since they fettered him I have no care
     That my returning steps to health are slow.They will not loose him till they know my fate,
     And I rest here till I am strong to slay,
   Meantime, my Heart's Delight may safely wait
     Among the Almond blossoms, sweet as they.Well, he won by day,
     But I won, what I so desired, by night,
   _My_ arms held what his lack till Judgment Day!Also, the game is not yet over--quite!Wait, Amir Ali, wait till I come forth
     To kill, before the Almond-trees are green,
   To raze thy very Memory from the North,
     _So that thou art not, and thou hast not been!_

   Aha!it is Duty
     To rid the World from Shiah dogs like thee,
   They are but ill-placed moles on Islam's beauty,
     Such as the Faithful cannot calmly see!Also thy bullet hurts me not a little,
     Thy Shiah blood might serve to salve the ill.Maybe some Afghan Promises are brittle;
     Never a Promise to oneself, to kill!Now I grow stronger, I have days of leisure
     To shape my coming Vengeance as I lie,
   And, undisturbed by call of War or Pleasure,
     Can dream of many ways a man may die.I shall not torture thee, thy friends might rally,
     Some Fate assist thee and prove false to me;
   Oh!shouldst thou now escape me, Amir Ali,
     This would torment me through Eternity!Aye, Shuffa-Jan, I will be quiet indeed,
     Give here the Hakim's powder if thou wilt,
   And thou mayst sit, for I perceive thy need,
     And rest thy soft-haired head upon my quilt.Thy gentle love will not disturb a mind
     That loves and hates beneath a fiercer Star.Also, thou know'st, my Heart is left behind,
     Among the Almond-trees of Kandahar!End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of India's Love Lyrics, by 
Adela Florence Cory Nicolson (AKA Laurence Hope), et al.2 represents this division in action, where the division may be
supposed to have been halted in line, on the words--“_Prepare for
action in front--dismount_”--Nos.1 and 3 having dismounted, and
given their leading reins to No.1 runs
forward about 15 or 20 paces with the chamber, which he draws from the
leather case at the back of No.2’s valise; and while Nos.2 and 3 are
preparing a Rocket, drawn from any one of the holsters most convenient,
No.1 fixes the chamber into the ground, pointing it to the desired
object, and lights his portfire ready for the first round, which No.3 by this time will have brought to him, and laid into the chamber;
there remains, then, only for No.1 to touch the vent of the Rocket
with his portfire, No.3 having run back for another round, which No.2 will have been able to prepare in the mean time.In this way the
sub-division will, without hurry, come into action with six bouches a
feù, in one minute’s time, and may continue their fire, without any
extraordinary exertion, at the rate of from two to three rounds from
each chamber in a minute, or even four with good exertion; so that the
six bouches a feù would discharge 80 rounds of 6-pounder ammunition in
three minutes.Twelve light frames for firing the 12-pounder Rockets at
high angles are further provided in addition to the ground chambers,
and each of the drivers of the ammunition horses has one in his charge,
in case of distant action.The preparation of the Rocket for firing is merely the fixing the stick
to it, either by the pincers, pointed hammer, or wrench, provided for
joining the parts of the stick also.These modes I have lately devised,
as being more simple and economical than the screw formerly used; but
cannot at present pronounce which is the best; great care, however,
must be taken to fix the stick securely, as every thing depends on it;
the vent also must be very carefully uncovered, as, if not perfectly
so, the Rocket is liable to burst; and in firing the portfire must not
be thrust too far into the Rocket, for the same reason.On the words “_Cease firing_,” No.1 cuts his portfire, takes up
his chamber, runs back to his section, and replaces the chamber
immediately.3 also immediately runs back; and having no other
operation to perform, replaces the leading reins, and the whole are
ready to mount again, for the performance of any further manœuvre that
may be ordered, in less than a minute from the word “_Cease firing_”
having been given.It is obvious that the combined celerity and quantity of the discharge
of ammunition of this description of artillery cannot be equalled or
even approached, taking in view the means and nature of ammunition
employed, by any other known system; the universality also of the
operation, not being incumbered with wheel carriages, must be duly
appreciated, as, in fact, it can proceed not only wherever cavalry can
act, but even wherever infantry can get into action; it having been
already mentioned that part of the exercise of these troops, supposing
them to be stopped by walls, or ditches and morasses, impassable to
horses, is to take the holsters and sticks from the horses, and advance
on foot.Another vast advantage is the few men required to make a complete
section, as by this means the number of points of fire is so greatly
multiplied, compared to any other system of artillery.Thus it may
be stated that the number of bouches a feù, which may comparatively
be brought into action, by equal means, on the scale of a troop of
horse artillery, would be at least six to one; and that they may
either be spread over a great extent of line, or concentrated into a
very small focus, according to the necessity of the service; indeed
the skirmishing exercise of the Rocket Cavalry, divided and spread
into separate sections, and returning by sound of bugle, forms a very
interesting part of the system, and can be well imagined from the
foregoing description and the annexed Plate.[Illustration: _Plate 3_  Fig. 1  Fig.2]




ROCKET CARS.1, represents a Rocket Car in line of march.There are
two descriptions of these cars, of similar construction--one for 32
or 24-pounder ammunition, the other for 18 or 12-pounder; and which
are, therefore, called heavy or light cars: the heavy car will carry
40 rounds of 24-pounder Rockets, armed with cohorn shells, and the
light one will convey 60 rounds of 12-pounder, or 50 of 18-pounder
ammunition, which is packed in boxes on the limber, the sticks being
carried in half lengths in the boxes on the after part of the carriage,
where the men also ride on seats fixed for the purpose, and answering
also for small store boxes; they are each supposed to be drawn by four
horses.These cars not only convey the ammunition, but are contrived also
to discharge each two Rockets in a volley from a double iron plate
trough, which is of the same length as the boxes for the sticks, and
travels between them; but which, being moveable, may, when the car is
unlimbered, be shifted into its fighting position at any angle from the
ground ranges, or point blank up to 45°, without being detached front
the carriage.2 represents these Rocket Cars in action: the one on the left
hand has its trough in the position for ground firing, the trough
being merely lifted off the bed of the axle tree on which it travels,
and laid on the ground, turning by two iron stays on a centre in the
axle tree; the right hand car is elevated to a high angle, the trough
being raised and supported by the iron stays behind, and in front by
the perch of the carriage, connected to it by a joint, the whole kept
steady by bolting the stays, and by tightening a chain from the perch
to the axle tree.The limbers are always supposed to be in the rear.The Rockets are fired with a portfire and long stick; and two men will
fight the light car, four men the heavy one.The exercise is very simple; the men being told off, Nos.1, 2, 3,
and 4, to the heavy carriage.On the words, “_Prepare for action, and
unlimber_,” the same process takes place as in the 6-pounder exercise.On the words, “_Prepare for ground firing_,” Nos.2 and 3 take hold
of the hand irons, provided on purpose, and, with the aid of No.4,
raise the trough from its travelling position, and lower it down to
the ground under the carriage; or on the words “_Prepare to elevate_,”
raise it to the higher angles, No.4 bolting the stays, and fixing the
chain.1 having in the mean time prepared and lighted his portfire,
and given the direction of firing to the trough, Nos.2, 3, and 4,
then run to the limber to fix the ammunition, which No.2 brings up,
two rounds at a time, or one, as ordered, and helping No.1 to place
them in the trough as far back as the stick will admit: this operation
is facilitated by No.1 stepping upon the lower end of either of the
stick boxes, on which a cleat is fastened for this purpose; No.1 then
discharges the two Rockets separately, firing that to leeward first,
while No.2 returns for more ammunition: this being the hardest duly,
the men will, of course, relieve No.In fighting the
light frame, two men are sufficient to elevate or depress it, but they
will want aid to fix and bring up the ammunition for quick firing.[Illustration: _Plate 4_  Fig. 1  Fig.2]




ROCKET INFANTRY IN LINE OF MARCH, AND IN ACTION.1, represents a sub-division of Rocket infantry in line
of march--Fig.The system here shewn is the use
of the Rockets by infantry--one man in ten, or any greater proportion,
carrying a frame, of very simple construction, from which the Rockets
may be discharged either for ground ranges, or at high angles, and
the rest carrying each three rounds of ammunition, which, for this
service, is proposed to be either the 12-pounder Shell Rockets, or the
12-pounder Rocket case shot, each round equal to the 6-pounder case,
and ranging 2,500 yards.So that 100 men will bring into action, in
any situation where musketry can be used, nearly 300 rounds of this
description of artillery, with ranges at 45°, double those of light
field ordnance.The exercise and words of command are as follow:

No.1 carries the frame, which is of very simple construction, standing
on legs like a theodolite, when spread, and which closes similarly
for carrying.This frame requires no spunging, the Rocket being fired
merely from an open cradle, from which it may be either discharged by
a lock or by a portfire, in which case.1 also carries the pistol,
portfire-lighter, and tube box.2 carries a small pouch, with the
requisite small stores, such as spare tubes, portfires, &c.; and a long
portfire stick.3, 4, and 5, &c. to 10, carry each, conveniently, on his back, a
pouch, containing three Rockets; and three sticks, secured together by
straps and buckles.With this distribution, they advance in double files.On the word
“_Halt_,” “_Prepare for action_,” being given, No.1 spreads his frame,
and with the assistance of No.2, fixes it firmly into the ground,
preparing it at the desired elevation.2 then hands the portfire
stick to No.1, who prepares and lights it, while No.2 steps back to
receive the Rocket; which has been prepared by Nos.3, 4, &c. who have
fallen back about fifteen paces, on the word being given to “_Prepare
for action_.” These men can always supply the ammunition quicker than
it can be fired, and one or other must therefore advance towards the
frame to meet No.2 having thus received
the Rocket, places it on the cradle, at the same instant that No.1
puts a tube into the vent.2 then points the frame, which has an
universal traverse after the legs are fixed; he then gives the word
“_Ready_,” “_Fire_,” to No.1, who takes up his portfire and discharges
the Rocket.1 now sticks his portfire stick into the ground, and
prepares another tube; while No.2, as before, puts the Rocket into the
frame, points, and gives the word “_Ready_,” “_Fire_,” again.By this
process, from three to four Rockets a minute may, without difficulty,
be fired from one frame, until the words “_Cease firing_,” “_Prepare
to advance_,” or “_retreat_,” are given; when the frame is in a moment
taken from the ground, and the whole party may either retire or advance
immediately in press time, if required.To insure which, and at the
same time to prevent any injury to the ammunition, Nos.3, 4, &c. must
not be allowed to take off their pouches, as they will be able to
assist one another in preparing the ammunition, by only laying down
their sticks; in taking up which again no time is lost.If the frame is fired with a lock, the same process is used, except
that No.1 primes and cocks, and No.2 fires on receiving the word from
No.For ground firing, the upper part of this frame, consisting of the
chamber and elevating stem, takes off from the legs, and the bottom of
the stem being pointed like a picquet post, forms a very firm bouche a
feù when stuck into the ground; the chamber at point blank being at a
very good height for this practice, and capable of traversing in any
direction.The exercise, in this case, is, of course, in other respects
similar to that at high angles.[Illustration: _Plate 5_  Fig. 1  Fig.2]




THE MODE OF USING ROCKETS IN BOMBARDMENT.1, represents the mode of carrying the bombarding frame
and ammunition by men.The apparatus required is merely a light
ladder, 12 feet in length, having two iron chambers, which are fixed
on in preparing for action at the upper end of the ladder; from which
chambers the Rockets are discharged, by means of a musket lock; the
ladder being reared to any elevation, by two legs or pry-poles, as in
Fig. 2.Every thing required for this service may be carried by men;
or a Flanders-pattern ammunition waggon, with four horses, will convey
60 rounds of 32-pounder Carcasses, in ten boxes, eight of the boxes
lying cross-ways on the floor of the waggon, and two length-ways, at
top.On these the frame, complete for firing two Rockets at a flight,
with spunges, &c. is laid; and the sticks on each side, to complete
the stowage of all that is necessary, the whole being covered by the
tilt.Four men only are required to be attached to each waggon, who are
numbered 1, 2, 3, & 4.The frame and ammunition having been brought into the battery, or to
any other place, concealed either by trees or houses (for from the
facility of taking new ground, batteries are not so indispensable as
with mortars), the words “_Prepare for bombardment_” are given; on
which the frame is prepared for rearing, Nos.1 and 2 first fixing the
chambers on the ladder; Nos.3 and 4 attaching the legs to the frame
as it lies on the ground.The words “_Rear frame_” are then given;
when all assist in raising it, and the proper elevation is given,
according to the words “_Elevate to 35°_” or “_45°_,” or whatever
angle the officer may judge necessary, according to the required
range, by spreading or closing the legs of the frame, agreeable to
the distances marked in degrees on a small measuring tape, which the
non-commissioned officer carries, and which is called--the Elevating
Line.The word “_Point_” is then given: which is done by means of a
plumb-line, hanging down from the vertex of the triangle, and which at
the same time shews whether the frame is upright or not.1 and 2 place themselves at the foot of the ladder,
and Nos.3 and 4 return to fix the ammunition in the rear, in readiness
for the word “_Load_.” When this is given, No.3 brings a Rocket to the
foot of the ladder, having before hand _carefully_ taken off the circle
that covered the vent, and handing it to No.1 has ascended the ladder to receive the first
Rocket from No.2, and to place it in the chamber at the top of the
ladder; by the time this is done, No.2 is ready to give him another
Rocket, which in like manner he places in the other chamber: he then
primes the locks with a tube and powder, and, cocking the two locks,
after every thing else is done, descends from the ladder, and, when
down, gives the word “_Ready_;” on which, he and No.2 each take one of
the trigger lines, and retire ten or twelve paces obliquely, waiting
for the word “_Fire_” from the officer or non-commissioned officer, on
which they pull, either separately or together, as previously ordered.1 immediately runs up and
spunges out the two chambers with a very wet spunge, having for this
purpose a water bucket suspended at the top of the frame; which being
done, he receives a Rocket from No.3 having, in
the mean time, brought up a fresh supply; in doing which, however, he
must never bring from the rear more than are wanted for each round.In this routine, any number of rounds is tired, until the words
“_Cease firing_” are given; which, if followed by those, “_Prepare to
retreat_,” Nos.3 and 4 run forward to the ladder; and on the words
_“Lower frame_,” they ease it down in the same order in which it was
raised, take it to pieces, and may thus retire in less than five
minutes: or if the object of ceasing to fire is merely a change of
position to no great distance, the four men may with ease carry the
frame, without taking it to pieces, the waggon following them with the
ammunition, or the ammunition being borne by men, as circumstances may
render expedient._The ammunition_ projected from this frame consists of 32-pounder
Rockets, armed with carcasses of the following sorts and ranges:--


1st.--_The small carcass_, containing 8 lbs.of carcass composition,
being 3 lbs.more than the present 10-inch spherical carcass.--Range
3,000 yards.2nd.--_The medium carcass_, containing 12 lbs.of carcass composition,
being equal to the present 13-inch.--Range 2,500 yards.3rd.--_The large carcass_, containing 18 lbs.of carcass composition,
being 6 lbs.more than the present 13-inch spherical carcass.--Range
2,000 yards.Or 32-pounder Rockets, armed with bursting cones, made of stout iron,
filled with powder, to be exploded by fuzes, and to be used to produce
the explosive effects of shells, where such effect is preferred to the
conflagration of the carcass.These cones contain as follows:--

_Small._--Five lbs.of powder, equal to the bursting powder of a
10-inch shell.--Range 3,000 yards.of powder, equal to the bursting powder of a
13-inch shell.--Range 2,500 yards.I have lately had a successful experiment, with bombarding
Rockets, six inches diameter, and weighing 148 lbs.--and doubt not of
extending the bombarding powers of the system much further.[Illustration: _Plate 6_  Fig. 1  Fig.2]




THE MODE OF USING ROCKETS IN BOMBARDMENT, FROM EARTH WORKS, WITHOUT
APPARATUS.1, is a perspective view of a Battery, erected expressly
for throwing Rockets in bombardment, where the interior <DW72> has the
angle of projection required, and is equal to the length of the Rocket
and stick.The great advantage of this system is, that, as it dispenses with
apparatus: where there is time for forming a work of this sort, of
considerable length, the quantity of fire, that may be thrown in a
given time, is limited only by the length of the work: thus, as the
Rockets may be laid in embrasures cut in the bank, at every two feet, a
battery of this description, 200 feet in length, will fire 100 Rockets
in a volley, and so on; or an incessant and heavy fire may, by such
a battery, be kept up from one flank to the other, by replacing the
Rockets as fast as they are fired in succession.The rule for forming this battery is as follows.“The length of the interior <DW72> of this work is half formed by the
excavation, and half by the earth thrown out; for the base therefore of
the interior <DW72> of the part to be raised, at an angle of 55°, set
off two thirds of the intended perpendicular height--cut down the <DW72>
to a perpendicular depth equal to the above mentioned height--then
setting off, for the breadth of the interior excavation, one third more
than the intended thickness of the work, carry down a regular ramp
from the back part of this excavation to the foot of the <DW72>, and
the excavation will supply the quantity of earth necessary to give the
exterior face a <DW72> of 45°.”

Fig.2 is a perspective view of a common epaulement converted into a
Rocket battery.In this case, as the epaulement is not of sufficient
length to support the Rocket and stick, holes must be bored in the
ground, with a miner’s borer, of a sufficient depth to receive the
sticks, and at such distances, and such an angle, as it is intended
to place the Rockets for firing.The inside of the epaulement must be
pared away to correspond with this angle, say 55°.The Rockets are then
to be laid in embrasures, formed in the bank, as in the last case.Where the ground is such as to admit of using the borer, this latter
system, of course, is the easiest operation; and for such ground as
would be likely to crumble into the holes, slight tubes are provided,
about two feet long, to preserve the opening; in fact, these tubes will
be found advantageous in all ground.2 also shews a powerful mode of defending a field work by means of
Rockets, in addition to the defences of the present system; merely by
cutting embrasures in the glacis, for horizontal firing.[Illustration: _Plate 7_  Fig. 1  Fig.2]




A ROCKET AMBUSCADE.1, represents one of the most important uses that can be
made of Rockets for field service; it is that of the Rocket Ambuscade
for the defence of a pass, or for covering the retreat of an army,
by placing any number, hundreds or thousands, of 32 or 24-pounder
shell Rockets, or of 32-pounder Rockets, armed with 18-pounder shot,
limited as to quantity only by the importance of the object, which
is to be obtained; as by this means, the most extensive destruction,
even amounting to annihilation, may be carried amongst the ranks of an
advancing enemy, and that with the exposure of scarcely an individual.The Rockets are laid in rows or batteries of 100 or 500 in a row,
according to the extent of ground to be protected.They are to be
concealed either in high grass, or masked in any other convenient
way; and the ambuscade may be formed of any required number of these
batteries, one behind the other, each battery being prepared to be
discharged in a volley, by leaders of quick match: so that one man is,
in fact, alone sufficient to fire the whole in succession, beginning
with that nearest to the enemy, as soon as he shall have perceived
them near enough to warrant his firing.Where the batteries are very
extensive, each battery may be sub-divided into smaller parts, with
separate trains to each, so that the whole, or any particular division
of each battery, may be fired, according to the number and position of
the enemy advancing.Trains, or leaders, are provided for this service,
of a particular construction, being a sort of flannel saucissons,
with two or three threads of slow match, which will strike laterally
at all points, and are therefore very easy of application; requiring
only to be passed from Rocket to Rocket, crossing the vents, by which
arrangement the fire running along, from vent to vent, is sure to
strike every Rocket in quick succession, without their disturbing each
others’ direction in going off, which they might otherwise do, being
placed within 18 inches apart, if all were positively fired at the same
instant.2 is a somewhat similar application, but not so much in the nature
of an ambuscade as of an open defence.Here a very low work is thrown
up, for the defence of a post, or of a chain of posts, consisting
merely of as much earth and turf as is sufficient to form the sides of
shallow embrasures for the large Rockets, placed from two to three feet
apart, or nearer; from which the Rockets are supposed to be discharged
independently, by a certain number of artillery-men, employed to keep
up the fire, according to the necessity of the case.It is evident, that by this mode, an incessant and tremendous fire may
be maintained, which it would be next to impossible for an advancing
enemy to pass through, not only from its quantity and the weight and
destructive nature of the ammunition, but from the closeness of its
lines and its contiguity to the ground; leaving, in fact, no space in
front which must not be passed over and ploughed up after very few
rounds.As both these operations are supposed to be employed in defensive
warfare, and therefore in fixed stations, there is no difficulty
involved in the establishment of a sufficient depôt of ammunition for
carrying them on upon the most extensive scale; though it is obviously
impossible to accomplish any thing approaching this system of defence,
by the ordinary means of artillery.[Illustration: _Plate 8_  Fig. 1  Fig.2]




THE USE OF ROCKETS IN THE ATTACK AND DEFENCE OF FORTIFIED PLACES.1, represents the advanced batteries and approaches in
the attack of some fortress, where an imperfect breach being supposed
to have been made in the salient angle of any bastion, large Rockets,
weighing each from two to three hundred weight or more, and being each
loaded with not less than a barrel of powder, are fired into the ruins
after the revetment is broken, in order, by continual explosions, to
render the breach practicable in the most expeditious way.To insure
every Rocket that is fired having the desired effect, they are so
heavily laden, as not to rise off the ground when fired along it; and
under these circumstances are placed in a small shallow trench, run
along to the foot of the glacis, from the nearest point of the third
parallel, and in a direct line for the breach: by this means, the
Rockets being laid in this trench will invariably pursue exactly the
same course, and every one of them will be infallibly lodged in the
breach.It is evident, that the whole of this is intended as a night
operation, and a few hours would suffice, not only for running forward
the trench, which need not be more than 18 inches deep, and about nine
inches wide, undiscovered, but also for firing a sufficient number of
Rockets to make a most complete breach before the enemy could take
means to prevent the combinations of the operation.From the experiments I have lately made, I have reason to believe, that
Rockets much larger than those above mentioned may be formed for this
description of service--Rockets from half a ton to a ton weight; which
being driven in very strong and massive cast iron cases, may possess
such strength and force, that, being fired by a process similar to
that above described, even against the revetment of any fortress,
unimpaired by a cannonade, it shall, by its mass and form, pierce the
same; and having pierced it, shall, with one explosion of several
barrels of powder, blow such portion of the masonry into the ditch, as
shall, with very few rounds, complete a practicable breach.It is evident, from this view of the weapon, that the Rocket System is
not only capable of a degree of portability, and facility for light
movements, which no weapon possesses, but that its ponderous parts, or
the individual masses of its ammunition, also greatly exceed those of
ordinary artillery.And yet, although this last description of Rocket
ammunition appears of an enormous mass, as ammunition, still if it be
found capable of the powers here supposed, of which _I_ have little
doubt, the whole weight to be brought in this way against any town, for
the accomplishment of a breach, will bear _no comparison_ whatever to
the weight of ammunition now required for the same service, independent
of the saving of time and expense, and the great comparative simplicity
of the approaches and works required for a siege carried on upon this
system.This class of Rockets I propose to denominate the _Belier a
feù_.2 represents the converse of this system, or the use of these
larger Rockets for the defence of a fortress by the demolition of the
batteries erected against it.In this case, the Rockets are fired from
embrasures, in the crest of the glacis, along trenches cut a part of
the way in the direction of the works to be demolished.[Illustration: _Plate 9_  Fig. 1  Fig.2]




OF THE USE OF ROCKETS BY INFANTRY AGAINST CAVALRY, AND IN COVERING THE
STORMING OF A FORTRESS.1, represents an attack of cavalry against infantry,
repulsed by the use of Rockets.These Rockets are supposed to be of the
lightest nature, 12 or 9-pounders, carried on bat horses or in small
tumbrils, or with 6-pounder shell Rockets, of which one man is capable
of carrying six in a bundle, for any peculiar service; or so arranged,
that the flank companies of every regiment may be armed, each man, with
such a Rocket, in addition to his carbine or rifle, the Rocket being
contained in a small leather case, attached to his cartouch, slinging
the carbine or rifle, and carrying the stick on his shoulder, serving
him either as a spear, by being made to receive the bayonet, or as a
rest for his piece.By this means every battalion would possess a powerful battery of
this ammunition, _in addition_ to all its ordinary means of attack
and defence, and with scarcely any additional burthen to the flank
companies, the whole weight of the Rocket and stick not exceeding six
pounds, and the difference between the weight of a rifle and that of a
musket being about equivalent.As to the mode of using them in action,
for firing at long ranges, as these Rockets are capable of a range of
2,000 yards, a few portable frames might be carried by each regiment,
without any incumbrance, the frames for this description of Rocket not
being heavier than a musket; but as the true intention of the arm, in
this distribution of it, is principally for close quarters, either
in case of a charge of cavalry, or even of infantry, it is generally
supposed to be fired in vollies, merely laid on the ground, as in
the Plate here described.And, as it is well known, how successfully
charges of cavalry are frequently sustained by infantry, even by the
fire of the musket alone, it is not presuming too much to infer, that
the repulse of cavalry would be _absolutely certain_, by masses of
infantry, possessing the additional aid of powerful vollies of these
shell Rockets.So also in charges of infantry, whether the battalion so
armed be about to charge, or to receive a charge, a well-timed volley
of one or two hundred such Rockets, judiciously thrown in by the flank
companies, must produce the most decisive effects.Neither can it be
doubted, that in advancing to an attack, the flank companies might
make the most formidable use of this arm, mixed with the fire of their
rifles or carbines, in all light infantry or tiraillieur manœuvres.In
like manner, in the passage of rivers, to protect the advanced party,
or for the establishment of a _tete-du-pont_, and generally on all such
occasions, Rockets will be found capable of the greatest service, as
shewn the other day in passing the Adour.In short, I must here remark
that the use of the Rocket, in these branches of it, is no more limited
than the use of gunpowder itself.2 represents the covering of the storm of a fortified place by
means of Rockets.These are supposed to be of the heavy natures, both
carcass and shell Rockets; the former fired in great quantities from
the trenches at high angles; the latter in ground ranges in front of
the third parallel.It cannot be doubted that the confusion created in
any place, by a fire of some thousand Rockets thus thrown at two or
three vollies quickly repeated, must be most favourable, either to the
storming of a particular breach, or to a general escalade.I must here observe, that although, in all cases, I lay the greatest
stress upon the use of this arm _in great quantities_, it is not
therefore to be presumed, that the effect of an individual Rocket
carcass, the smallest of which contains as much combustible matter as
the 10-inch spherical carcass, is not at least equal to that of the
10-inch spherical carcass: or that the explosion of a shell thrown by a
Rocket, is not in its effects equal to the explosion of that same shell
thrown by any other means: but that, as the power of _instantaneously_
throwing the _most unlimited_ quantities of carcasses or shells is the
_exclusive property_ of this weapon, and as there can be no question
that an infinitely greater effect, both physical[A] as well as moral,
is produced by the instantaneous application of any quantity of
ammunition, with innumerable other advantages, than by a fire in slow
succession of that same quantity: so it would be an absolute absurdity,
and a downright waste of power, not to make this exclusive property the
general basis of every application of the weapon, limited only by a due
proportion between the expenditure and the value of the object to be
attained--a limit which I should always conceive it more advisable to
exceed than to fall short of.[A] For a hundred fires breaking out at once, must necessarily
        produce more destruction than when they happen in
        succession, and may therefore be extinguished as fast as
        they occur.There is another most important use in this weapon, in the storming of
fortified places, which should here be mentioned, viz.that as it is
the only description of artillery ammunition that can ever be carried
into a place by a storming party, and as, in fact, the heaviest Rockets
may accompany an escalade, so the value of it in these operations is
infinite, and no escalade should ever be attempted without.It would
enable the attackers, the moment they have got into the place, not only
to scour the parapet most effectually, and to enfilade any street or
passage where they may be opposed, and which they may wish to force;
but even if thrown at random into the town, must distract the garrison,
while it serves as a certain index to the different storming parties as
to the situation and progress of each party.[Illustration: _Plate 10_  Fig. 1  Fig.2]




THE USE OF ROCKETS FROM BOATS.Plate 11 represents two men of war’s launches throwing Rockets.The
frame is the same as that used for bombardment on shore, divested of
the legs or prypoles, on which it is supported in land service; for
which, afloat, the foremast of the boat is substituted.To render,
therefore, the application of the common bombarding frame universal,
each of them is constructed with a loop or traveller, to connect it
with the mast, and guide it in lowering and raising, which is done by
the haulyards.The leading boat in the plate represents the act of firing; where the
frame being elevated to any desired angle, the crew have retired into
the stern sheets, and a marine artillery-man is discharging a Rocket by
a trigger-line, leading aft.In the second boat, these artillery-men
are in the act of loading; for which purpose, the frame is lowered to
a convenient height; the mainmast is also standing, and the mainsail
set, but partly brailed up.This sail being kept wet, most effectually
prevents, without the least danger to the sail, any inconvenience to
the men from the smoke or small sparks of the Rocket when going off;
it should, therefore, be used where no objection exists on account of
wind.It is not, however, by any means indispensable, as I have myself
discharged some hundred Rockets from these boats, nay, even from a
six-oared cutter, without it.From this application of the sail, it is
evident, that Rockets may be thrown from these boats under sail, as
well as at anchor, or in rowing.In the launch, the ammunition may be
very securely stowed in the stern sheets, covered with tarpaulins, or
tanned hides.In the six-oared cutter, there is not room for this, and
an attending boat is therefore necessary: on which account, as well as
from its greater steadiness, the launch is preferable, where there is
no obstacle as to currents or shoal water.Here it may be observed, with reference to its application in the
marine, that as the power of discharging this ammunition without the
burthen of ordnance, gives it _exclusive_ facilities for land service,
so also, its property of being projected without reaction upon the
point of discharge, gives it _exclusive_ facilities for sea service:
insomuch, that Rockets conveying the same quantity of combustible
matter, as by the ordinary system would be thrown from the largest
mortars, and from ships of very heavy tonnage, may be used out of the
smallest boats of the navy; and the 12-pounder and 18-pounder have been
frequently fired even from four-oared gigs.It should here also be remarked, that the 12 and 18-pounder shell
Rockets recochét in the water remarkably well at low angles.There is
another use for Rockets in boat service also, which ought not to be
passed over--namely, their application in facilitating the capture of a
ship by boarding.In this service 32-pounder shell Rockets are prepared with a short
stick, having a leader and short fuze fixed to the stick for firing the
Rocket.Thus prepared, every boat intended to board is provided with
10 or 12 of these Rockets; the moment of coming alongside, the fuzes
are lighted, and the whole number of Rockets immediately launched by
hand through the ports into the ship; where, being left to their own
impulse, they will scour round and round the deck until they explode,
so as very shortly to clear the way for the boarders, both by actual
destruction, and by the equally powerful operation of terror amongst
the crew; the boat lying quietly alongside for a few seconds, until, by
the explosion of the Rockets, the boarders know that the desired effect
has been produced, and that no mischief can happen to themselves when
they enter the vessel.[Illustration: _Plate 11_]




THE USE OF ROCKETS IN FIRE SHIPS, AND THE MODE OF FITTING ANY OTHER
SHIP FOR THE DISCHARGE OF ROCKETS.1, represents the application of Rockets in fire-ships;
by which, a great power of _distant_ conflagration is given to these
ships, in addition to the limited powers they now possess, as depending
entirely on _contact_ with the vessels they may be intended to destroy.The application is made as follows:--Frames or racks are to be provided
in the tops of all fire-ships, to contain as many hundred carcass and
shell Rockets, as can be stowed in them, tier above tier, and nearly
close together.These racks may also be applied in the topmast and
top-gallant shrouds, to increase the number: and when the time arrives
for sending her against the enemy, the Rockets are placed in these
racks, at different angles, and in all directions, having the vents
uncovered, but requiring no leaders, or any nicety of operation, which
can be frustrated either by wind or rain; as the Rockets are discharged
merely by the progress of the flame ascending the rigging, at a
considerable lapse of time after the ship is set on fire, and abandoned.It is evident, therefore, in the first place that no injury can happen
to the persons charged with carrying in the vessel, as they will
have returned into safety before any discharge takes place.It is
evident, also, that the most extensive destruction to the enemy may be
calculated on, as the discharge will commence about the time that the
fire-ship has drifted in amongst the enemies’ ships: when issuing in
the most tremendous vollies, the smallest ship being supposed not to
have less than 1,000 Rockets, distributed in different directions, it
is impossible but that every ship of the enemy must, with fire-ships
enough, and no stint of Rockets, be covered sooner or later with
clouds of this destructive fire; whereas, without this _distant power
of destruction_, it is ten to one if every fire-ship does not pass
harmlessly through the fleet, by the exertions of the enemies’ boats
in towing them clear--_exertions_, it must be remarked, _entirely
precluded_ in this system of fire-ships, as it is impossible that any
boat could venture to approach a vessel so equipped, and pouring forth
shell and carcass Rockets, in all directions, and at all angles.I had
an opportunity of trying this experiment in the attack of the French
Fleet in Basque Roads, and though on a very small scale indeed, it was
ascertained, that the greatest confusion and terror was created by it
in the enemy.2, 3, and 4, represent the mode of fitting any ship to fire
Rockets, from scuttles in her broadside; giving, thereby, to every
vessel having a between-deck, a Rocket battery, in addition to the
gun batteries on her spar deck, without the one interfering in the
smallest degree with the other, or without the least risk to the ship;
the sparks of the Rocket in going off being completely excluded, either
by iron shutters closing the scuttle from within, as practised in the
Galgo defence ship, fitted with 21 Rocket scuttles in her broadside,
as shewn in Fig.3; or by a particular construction of scuttle and
frame which I have since devised, and applied to the Erebus sloop of
war: so that the whole of the scuttle is completely filled, in all
positions of traverse, and at all angles, by the frame; and thereby any
possibility of the entrance of fire completely prevented.In both these
ships, the Rockets may be either discharged at the highest angles, for
bombardment, or used at low angles, as an additional means of offence
or defence against other shipping in action; as the Rockets, thus used,
are capable of projecting 18-pounder shot, or 4½-inch shells, or even
24-pounder solid shot.This arrangement literally gives the description
of small vessels here mentioned, a second and most powerful deck, for
general service as well as for bombardment.Smaller vessels, such as gun brigs, schooners, and cutters, may be
fitted to fire Rockets by frames, similar to the boat frames, described
in Plate 11, from their spar deck, and either over the broadside or
the stern; their frames being arranged to travel up and down, on a
small upright spar or boat’s mast, fixed perpendicularly to the outside
of the bulwark of the vessel.As a temporary expedient, or in small
vessels, this mode answers very well; but it has the objection of not
carrying the sparks so far from the rigging, as when fired from below:
it interferes also with the fighting the guns at the same time, and
can therefore only be applied exclusively in the case of bombardment.All the gun brigs, however, on the Boulogne station, during Commodore
OWEN’s command there, were fitted in this manner, some with two and
some with three frames on a broadside.[Illustration: _Plate 12_  Fig. 1  Fig. 2  Fig. 3  Fig.4]




ROCKET AMMUNITION.Plate 13 represents all the different natures of Rocket Ammunition
which have hitherto been made, from the eight-inch carcass or explosion
Rocket, weighing nearly three hundred weight, to the six-pounder shell
Rocket, and shews the comparative dimensions of the whole.This Ammunition may be divided into three parts--the heavy, medium, and
light natures.The _heavy natures_ are those denominated by the number
of inches in their diameter; the _medium_ from the 42-pounder to the
24-pounder inclusive; and the _light natures_ from the 18-pounder to
the 6-pounder inclusive.The ranges of the eight-inch, seven-inch, and six-inch Rockets, are
from 2,000 to 2,500 yards; and the quantities of combustible matter,
or bursting powder, from 25lbs.Their sticks
are divided into four parts, secured with ferules, and carried in
the angles of the packing case, containing the Rocket, one Rocket in
each case, so that notwithstanding the length of the stick, the whole
of this heavy part of the system possesses, in proportion, the same
facility as the medium and light parts.These Rockets are fired from
bombarding frames, similar to those of the 42 and 32-pounder carcasses;
or they may be fired from a <DW72> of earth in the same way.They may
also be fired along the ground, as explained in Plate 9, for the
purposes of explosion.These large Rockets have from their weight, combined with less
diameter, even more penetration than the heaviest shells, and are
therefore equally efficient for the destruction of bomb proofs, or the
demolition of strong buildings; and their construction having now been
realized, it is proved that the facilities of the Rocket system are not
its only excellence, but that it actually will propel heavier masses
than can be done by any other means; that is to say, masses, to project
which, it would be scarcely possible to cast, much less to transport,
mortars of sufficient magnitude.Various modifications of the powers
of these large Rockets may be made, which it is not necessary here to
specify.The 42 and 32-pounders are those which have hitherto been principally
used in bombardment, and which, for the general purposes of
bombardment, will be found sufficient, while their portability renders
them in that respect more easily applied.I have therefore classed them
as medium Rockets.These Rockets will convey from ten to seven pounds
of combustible matter each; have a range of upwards of 3,000 yards; and
may, where the fall of greater mass in any particular spot is required,
either for penetration or increased fire, be discharged in combinations
of three, four, or six Rockets, well lashed together, with the sticks
in the centre also strongly bound together.The great art of firing
these _fasces of Rockets_ is to arrange them, so that they may be
sure to take fire contemporaneously, which must be done either by
priming the bottoms of all thoroughly, or by firing them by a flash of
powder, which is sure to ignite the whole combination at once.The 42
and 32-pounder Rockets may also be used as explosion Rockets, and the
32-pounder armed with shot or shells: thus, a 32-pounder will range
at least 1,000 yards, laid on the ground, and armed with a 5½-inch
howitzer shell, or an 18 and even a 24-pounder solid shot.The 32-pounder is, as it were, the mean point of the system: it is the
least Rocket used as a carcass in bombardment, and the largest armed
either with shot or shell, for field service.Daniel travelled to the hallway.The 24-pounder Rocket is
very nearly equal to it in all its applications in the field; from the
saving of weight, therefore, I consider it preferable.It is perfectly
equal to propel the cohorn shell or 12-pounder shot.The 18-pounder, which is the first of the _light_ natures of Rockets,
is armed with a 9-pounder shot or shell; the 12-pounder with a
6-pounder ditto; the 9-pounder with a grenade; and the 6-pounder
with a 3-pounder shot or shell.These shells, however, are now cast
expressly for the Rocket service, and are elliptical instead of
spherical, thereby increasing the power of the shell, and decreasing
the resistance of the air.From the 24-pounder to the 9-pounder Rocket, inclusive, a description
of case shot Rocket is formed of each nature, armed with a quantity
of musket or carbine balls, put into the top of the cylinder of the
Rocket, and from thence discharged by a quantity of powder contained
in a chamber, by which the velocity of these balls, when in flight, is
increased beyond that of the Rocket’s motion, an effect which cannot be
given in the spherical case, where the bursting powder only liberates
the balls.All Rockets intended for explosion, whether the powder be contained
in a wrought iron head or cone, as used in bombardment: or whether in
the shell above mentioned, for field service, or in the case shot,
are fitted with an external fuse of paper, which is ignited from
the vent at the moment when the Rocket is fired.These fuses may be
instantaneously cut to any desired length, from 25 seconds downwards,
by a pair of common scissars or nippers, and communicate to the
bursting charge, by a quickmatch, in a small tube on the outside of the
Rocket; in the shell Rocket the paper fuse communicates with a wooden
fuse in the shell, which, being cut to the shortest length that can
be necessary, is never required to be taken out of the shell, but is
regulated either by taking away the paper fuse altogether, or leaving
any part of it, which, in addition to the fixed and permanent wooden
fuse in the shell, may make up the whole time of flight required.By
this system, the arrangement of the fuse in action is attended with a
facility, security, and an expedition, not known in any other similar
operations.All the Rocket sticks for land service are made in parts of convenient
length for carriage, and jointed by iron ferules.For sea service they
are made in the whole length.The 24-pounder shell and case shot Rockets are those which I propose
issuing in future for the heavy field carriages; the 18-pounder shell
and case shot for the light field carriages; the 12-pounder for the
mounted ammunition of cavalry; the 9 and 6-pounders for infantry,
according to the different cases already explained.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, represent the different implements
used for jointing the sticks, or fixing them to the Rocket, being of
different sizes, in proportion to the different natures to which they
belong.They consist of hammers, pincers, vices, and wrenches, all to
accomplish the same object, namely, that of compressing the ferule into
the stick, by means of strong steel points in the tool, so as to fix
it immoveably.The varieties are here all shewn, because I have not
hitherto decided which is the preferable instrument.10, 11, 12, and 13, represent another mode of arranging the
different natures of ammunition, which is hitherto merely a matter of
speculation, but which may in certain parts of the system be hereafter
found a considerable improvement.It is the carrying the Rocket, or
projectile force, distinct from the ammunition itself, instead of
combining them in their first construction, as hitherto supposed.11, 12, and 13, are respectively
a shell, case shot, or carcass, which may be immediately fixed to the
Rocket by a screw, according as either the one or the other nature is
required at the time.A greater variety of ammunition might thus be
carried for particular services, with a less burthen altogether.14 and 15 represent the light ball or floating carcass Rocket.This is supposed to be a 42-pounder Rocket, containing in its head, as
in Fig.12, a parachute with a light ball or carcass attached to it by
a slight chain.This Rocket being fired nearly perpendicularly into the
air, the head is burst off at its greatest altitude, by a very small
explosion, which, though it ignites the light ball, does not injure the
parachute; but by liberating it from the Rocket, leaves it suspended
in the air, as Fig.13, in which situation, as a light ball, it will
continue to give a very brilliant light, illuminating the atmosphere
for nearly ten minutes; or as a carcass, in a tolerable breeze, will
float in the air, and convey the fire for several miles, unperceived
and unconsumed, if only the match of the carcass be ignited at the
disengagement of the parachute.It should be observed that, with due care, the Rocket ammunition is
not only the most secure, but the most durable that can be: every
Rocket is, in fact, a charge of powder hermetically sealed in a metal
case, impervious either to the ordinary accidents by fire, or damage
from humidity.I have used Rockets that had been three years on board
of ship, without any apparent loss of power; and when after a certain
period, which, from my present experience, I cannot estimate at less
than eight or ten years, their force shall have so far suffered as to
render them unserviceable, they may again be regenerated, at the mere
expense of boring out the composition and re-driving it: the stick,
case, &c. that is to say, all the principal parts, being as serviceable
as ever.[Illustration: _Plate 13_ Figs.1–15]

CONCLUSION.Calculations proving the comparative Economy of the Rocket Ammunition,
both as to its Application in Bombardment and in the Field.So much misapprehension having been entertained with regard to the
expense of the Rocket system, it is very important, for the true
understanding of the weapon, to prove, that it is by far the cheapest
mode of applying artillery ammunition, both in bombardment and in the
field.To begin with the expense of making the 32-pounder Rocket Carcass,
which has hitherto been principally used in bombardments, compared with
the 10-inch Carcass, which conveys even less combustible matter._s._  _d._

If the construction were more systematic, and elementary force used
instead of manual labour, the expense of driving the Rocket might be
reduced four-fifths, which would lower the amount to about 18_s._
each Rocket, complete; and if bamboo were substituted, which I am
endeavouring to accomplish, for the stick, the whole expense of each
32-pounder Carcass Rocket would be about 16_s._ each.Now as the calculation of the expense of the Rocket includes that of
the projectile force, which conveys it 3,000 yards; to equalize the
comparison, to the cost of the spherical carcass must be added that of
the charge of powder required to convey it the same distance._s._  _d._

                                                         ------------


So that even with the present disadvantages of manufacture, there is an
actual saving in the 32-pounder Rocket carcass itself, which contains
more composition than the 10-inch spherical carcass, _without allowing
any thing for the difference of expense of the Rocket apparatus, and
that of the mortar, mortar beds, platforms, &c._ which, together
with the difficulty of transport, constitute the greatest expense of
throwing the common carcass; whereas, the cost of apparatus for the
use of the Rocket carcass does not originally exceed £5; and indeed,
on most occasions, the Rocket may, as has been shewn, be thrown even
without any apparatus at all: besides which, it may be stated, that
a transport of 250 tons will convey 5,000 Rocket carcasses, with
every thing required for using them, on a very extensive scale; while
on shore, a common ammunition waggon will carry 60 rounds, with the
requisites for action.The difference in all these respects, as to the
10-inch spherical carcass, its mortars, &c. is too striking to need
specifying.But the comparison as to expense is still more in favour of the Rocket,
when compared with the larger natures of carcasses.The 13-inch
spherical carcass costs £1.17_s._ 11½_d._ to throw it 2,500 yards; the
32-pounder Rocket carcass, conveying the same quantity of combustible
matter, does not cost more than £1.5_s._ 0_d._--so that in this case
there is a saving on the first cost of 12_s._ 11½_d._ Now the large
Rocket carcass requires no more apparatus than the small one, and the
difference of weight, as to carriage, is little more than that of the
different quantities of combustible matter contained in each, while the
difference of weight of the 13-inch and 10-inch carcasses is at least
double, as is also that of the mortars; and, consequently, all the
other comparative charges are enhanced in the same proportion.In like manner, the 42-pounder Carcass Rocket, which contains from 15
to 18 lbs.of combustible matter, will be found considerably cheaper in
the first cost than the 13-inch spherical carcass: and a proportionate
economy, including the ratio of increased effect, will attach also to
the still larger natures of Rockets which I have now made.Thus the
first cost of the 6-inch Rocket, weighing 150 lbs.of combustible matter, is not more than £3.10_s._ that is to
say, less than double the first cost of the 13-inch spherical carcass,
though its conflagrating powers, or the quantity of combustible matter
conveyed by it, are three times as great, and its mass and penetration
are half as much again as that of the 10-inch shell or carcass.It is
evident, therefore, that however extended the magnitude of Rockets
may be, and I am now endeavouring to construct some, the falling
mass of which will be considerably more than that of the 13-inch
shell or carcass, and whose powers, therefore, either of explosion or
conflagration, will rise even in a higher ratio, still, although the
first cost may exceed that of any projectile at present thrown, on a
comparison of effects, there will be a great saving in favour of the
Rocket System.It is difficult to make a precise calculation as to the average
expense of every common shell or carcass, actually thrown against the
enemy; but it is generally supposed and admitted, that, on a moderate
estimate, these missiles, one with another, cannot cost government
less than £5 each; nor can this be doubted, when, in addition to the
first cost of the ammunition, that of the _ordnance_, and _the charges
incidental to its application_, are considered.But as to the Rocket
and its apparatus, it has been seen, that the _principal expense_ is
that of the first construction, an expense, which it must be fairly
stated, that the charges of conveyance cannot more than double under
any circumstances; so that where the mode of throwing carcasses by
32-pounder Rockets is adopted, there is, at least, an average saving
of £3 on every carcass so thrown, and proportionally for the larger
natures; especially as not only the conflagrating powers of the
spherical carcass are equalled even by the 32-pounder Rocket, but
greatly exceeded by the larger Rockets; and the more especially indeed,
as the difference of accuracy, for the purposes of bombardment, is not
worthy to be mentioned, since it is no uncommon thing for shells fired
from a mortar at long ranges, to spread to the right and left of each
other, upwards of 500 or even 600 yards, as was lately proved by a
series of experiments, where the mortar bed was actually fixed in the
ground; an aberration which the Rocket will never equal, unless some
accident happens to the stick in firing; and this, I may venture to
say, does not occur oftener than the failure of the fuze in the firing
of shells.The fact is, that whatever aberration does exist in the
Rocket, it is distinctly seen; whereas, in ordinary projectiles it is
scarcely to be traced--and hence has arisen a very exaggerated notion
of the inaccuracy of the former.But to recur to the economy of the Rocket carcass; how much is not the
saving of this system of bombardment enhanced, when considered with
reference to naval bombardment, when the expensive construction of the
large mortar vessel is viewed, together with the charge of their whole
establishment, compared with the few occasions of their use, and their
unfitness for general service?Whereas, by means of the Rocket, every
vessel, nay, every boat, has the power of throwing carcasses without
any alteration in her construction, or any impediment whatever to her
general services.So much for the comparison required as to the application of the Rocket
in bombardment; I shall now proceed to the calculation of the expense
of this ammunition for field service, compared with that of common
artillery ammunition.In the first place, it should be stated that the
Rocket will project every species of shot or shell which can be fired
from field guns, and indeed, even heavier ammunition than is ordinarily
used by artillery in the field.But it will be a fair criterion to make
the calculation, with reference to the six and nine-pounder common
ammunition; these two natures of shot or shell are projected by a small
Rocket, which I have denominated the 12-pounder, and which will give
horizontally, and _without apparatus_, the same range as that of the
gun, and _with apparatus_, considerably more.The calculation may be
stated as follows:--

                                           £._s._  _d._
                      {Case and stick      0    5     6
  12-pounder Rocket   {Rocket composition  0    1    10½
                      {Labour, &c.0    2     0
                                          --------------
                                          £0    9     4½
                                          --------------

But this sum is capable of the following reduction, by substituting
elementary force for manual labour, and by employing bamboo in lieu of
the stick._s._  _d._
                    {Case and stick  0   4     0
  [B]Reduced Price  {Composition     0   1    10½
                    {Driving         0   0     6
                                    -------------
                                    £0   6     4½
                                    -------------

    [B] And this is the sum that, ought to be taken in a general
        calculation of the advantages of which the system is
        _capable_, because to this it _may_ be brought.Now the cost of the shot or spherical case is the same whether
projected from a gun or thrown by the Rocket; and the fixing it to the
Rocket costs about the same as strapping the shot to the wooden bottom.This 6_s._ 4½_d._ therefore is to be set against the value of the
gunpowder, cartridge, &c. required for the gun, which may be estimated
as follows:--

                                                         £._s._  _d._

                                                         -------------
                                                         £0   2     7¼
                                                         -------------

                                                         £._s._  _d._
  9-pounder Amm’n.{For the 9-pounder charge of powder   0   3     0
                    {Cartridge, 4½_d._ wooden bottom,     0   0     8¼
                    {  2½_d._ and tube, 1¼_d._
                                                         -------------
                                                         £0   3     8¼
                                                         -------------

Taking the average, therefore, of the six and nine-pounder ammunition,
the Rocket ammunition costs 3_s._ 2¾_d._ a round more than the common
ammunition.Now we must compare the simplicity of the use of the Rocket, with the
expensive apparatus of artillery, to see what this trifling difference
of first cost in the Rocket has to weigh against it.In the first
place, we have seen, that in many situations the Rocket requires no
apparatus at all to use it, and that, where it does require any, it
is of the simplest kind: we have seen also, that both infantry and
cavalry can, in a variety of instances, combine this weapon with their
other powers; so that it is not, in such cases, _even to be charged
with the pay of the men_.These, however, are circumstances that can
_in no case_ happen with respect to ordinary artillery ammunition; the
use of which never can be divested of the expense of the construction,
transport, and maintenance of the necessary ordnance to project it,
or of the men _exclusively_ required to work that ordnance.What
proportion, therefore, will the trifling difference of first cost, and
the average facile and unexpensive application of the Rocket bear to
the heavy contingent charges involved in the use of field artillery?It
is a fact, that, in the famous Egyptian campaign, those charges did not
amount to less than £20 per round, one with another, _exclusive_ of the
pay of the men; nor can they for any campaign be put at less than from
£2 to £3 per round.It must be obvious, therefore, although it is not
perhaps practicable actually to clothe the calculation in figures, that
the saving must be very great indeed in favour of the Rocket, in the
field as well as in bombardment.Thus far, however, the calculation is limited merely as to the bare
question of expense; but on the score of general advantage, how is not
the balance augmented in favour of the Rocket, when all the _exclusive_
facilities of its use are taken into the account--the _universality_
of the application, the _unlimited_ quantity of instantaneous fire
to be produced by it for particular occasions--of fire not to be by
any possibility approached in quantity by means of ordnance?Now to
all these points of excellence one only drawback is attempted to be
stated--this is, the difference of accuracy: but the value of the
objection vanishes when fairly considered; for in the first place, it
must be admitted, that the general business of action is not that of
target-firing; and the more especially with a weapon like the Rocket,
which possesses the facility of bringing such quantities of fire on any
point: thus, if the difference of accuracy were as ten to one against
the Rocket, as the facility of using it is at least as ten to one in
its favour, the ratio would be that of equality.The truth is, however,
that the difference of accuracy, for actual application against troops,
instead of ten to one, cannot be stated even as two to one; and,
consequently, the compound ratio as to effect, the same shot or shell
being projected, would be, even with this admission of comparative
inaccuracy, greatly in favour of the Rocket System.But it must still
further be borne in mind, that this system is yet in its infancy, that
much has been accomplished in a short time, and that there is every
reason to believe, that the accuracy of the Rocket may be actually
brought upon a par with that of other artillery ammunition for all the
important purposes of field service.Transcriber’s Notes


Punctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.Ambiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained; occurrences of
inconsistent hyphenation have not been changed.In the table of Ranges:

  Transcriber rearranged parts of the column headings, but “as
  follow” (singular) in the table’s title was printed that way in
  the original.The column heading “55 to 60°” was misprinted as “55 to 66°”;
  corrected here.The British in Montreal organized among themselves a volunteer
rifle corps, eight hundred strong, 'to protect their persons and
property, and to assist in maintaining the rights and principles
granted them by the constitution'; and there was much indignation when
the rifle corps was forced to disband by order of the governor, who
declared that the constitution was in no danger, and that, even if it
were, the government would be competent to deal with the situation.Nor did Gosford find it plain sailing with all the French Canadians.Papineau's followers in the House took up at first a distinctly
independent attitude.Gosford was informed {52} that the appointment
of the royal commission was an insult to the Assembly; it threw doubt
on the assertions which Papineau and his followers had made in
petitions and resolutions.If the report of the commissioners turned
out to be in accord with the views of the House, well and good; but if
not, that would not influence the attitude of the House.In spite, however, of the uneasiness of the English official element,
and the obduracy of the extreme _Patriotes_, it is barely possible that
Gosford, with his _bonhomie_ and his Burgundy, might have effected a
modus vivendi, had there not occurred, about six months after Gosford's
arrival in Canada, one of those unfortunate and unforeseen events which
upset the best-laid schemes of mice and men.This was the indiscreet
action of Sir Francis Bond Head, the newly appointed
lieutenant-governor of Upper Canada, in communicating to the
legislature of Upper Canada the _ipsissima verba_ of his instructions
from the Colonial Office.It was immediately seen that a discrepancy
existed between the tenor of Sir Francis Bond Head's instructions and
the tenor of Lord Gosford's speech at the opening of the legislature of
Lower Canada in 1835.{53} Sir Francis Bond Head's instructions showed
beyond peradventure that the British government did not contemplate any
real constitutional changes in the Canadas; above all, it did not
propose to yield to the demand for an elective Legislative Council.This fact was called to the attention of Papineau and his friends by
Marshall Spring Bidwell, the speaker of the Assembly of Upper Canada;
and immediately the fat was in the fire.Papineau was confirmed in his
belief that justice could not be hoped for; those who had been won over
by Gosford's blandishments experienced a revulsion of feeling; and
Gosford saw the fruit of his efforts vanishing into thin air.Lord Gosford had asked the
Assembly to vote a permanent civil list, in view of the fact that the
government offered to hand over to the control of the legislature the
casual and territorial revenues of the Crown.But the publication of
Sir Francis Bond Head's instructions effectually destroyed any hope of
this compromise being accepted.In the session of the House which was
held in the early part of 1836, Papineau and his friends not only
refused to vote a permanent civil {54} list; they declined to grant
more than six months' supply in any case; and with this they made the
threat that if the demands of the _Patriotes_ were not met at the end
of the six months, no more supplies would be voted.This action was
deemed so unsatisfactory that the Legislative Council threw out the
bill of supply.The result was widespread distress among the public
officials of the colony.This was the fourth year in which no
provision had been made for the upkeep of government.In 1833 the bill
of supply had been so cumbered with conditions that it had been
rejected by the Legislative Council.In 1834, owing to disputes
between the Executive and the Assembly, the legislature had separated
without a vote on the estimates.In 1835 the Assembly had declined to
make any vote of supply.In earlier years the Executive had been able,
owing to its control of certain royal and imperial revenues, to carry
on the government after a fashion under such circumstances; but since
it had transferred a large part of these revenues to the control of the
legislature, it was no longer able to meet the situation.Papineau and
his friends doubtless recognized that they now had the 'Bureaucrats' at
their mercy; and {55} they seem to have made up their minds to achieve
the full measure of their demands, or make government impossible by
withholding the supplies, no matter what suffering this course might
inflict on the families of the public servants.In the autumn of 1836 the royal commissioners brought their labours to
a close.Lord Gosford, it is true, remained in the colony as governor
until the beginning of 1838, and Sir George Gipps remained until the
beginning of 1837, but Sir Charles Grey left for England in November
1836 with the last of the commissioners' reports.These reports, which
were six in number, exercised little direct influence upon the course
of events in Canada.The commissioners pronounced against the
introduction of responsible government, in the modern sense of the
term, on the ground that it would be incompatible with the status of a
colony.They advised against the project of an elective Legislative
Council.In the event of a crisis arising, they submitted the question
whether the total suspension of the constitution would not be less
objectionable than any partial interference with the particular
clauses.It is evident from the reports that the commissioners had
{56} bravely survived their earlier view that the discontented
Canadians might be won over by unctuous blandishments alone.They
could not avoid the conclusion that this policy had failed.[1] He was really of Swiss extraction.{57}

CHAPTER VII

THE RUSSELL RESOLUTIONS

When the legislature of Lower Canada met in the autumn of 1836, Lord
Gosford earnestly called its attention to the estimates of the current
year and the accounts showing the arrears unpaid.Six months, however,
had passed by, and there was no sign of the redress of grievances.The
royal commission, indeed, had not completed its investigations.The
Assembly, therefore, refused once more to vote the necessary supplies.'In reference to the demand for a supply,' they told the governor,
'relying on the salutary maxim, that the correction of abuses and the
redress of grievances ought to precede the grant thereof, we have been
of opinion that there is nothing to authorize us to alter our
resolution of the last session.'This answer marked the final and indubitable breakdown of the policy of
conciliation without concession.This was recognized by {58} Gosford,
who soon afterwards wrote home asking to be allowed to resign, and
recommending the appointment of a governor whose hands were 'not
pledged as mine are to a mild and conciliatory line of policy.'Two alternatives were now open to the British ministers--either to make
a complete capitulation to the demands of the _Patriotes_, or to deal
with the situation in a high-handed way.They chose the latter course,
though with some hesitation and perhaps with regret.On March 6, 1837,
Lord John Russell, chancellor of the Exchequer in the Melbourne
administration and one of the most liberal-minded statesmen in England,
introduced into the House of Commons ten resolutions dealing with the
affairs of Canada.These resolutions recited that since 1832 no
provision had been made by the Assembly of Lower Canada for defraying
the charges for the administration of justice or for the support of the
civil government; that the attention of the Assembly had been called to
the arrears due; and that the Assembly had declined to vote a supply
until its demands for radical political changes were satisfied.The
resolutions declared that though both the bodies in question might be
improved in respect of their composition, it {59} was inadvisable to
grant the demand to make the Legislative Council elective, or to
subject the Executive Council to the responsibility demanded by the
House of Assembly.In regard to the financial question, the
resolutions repeated the offer made by Lord Aylmer and Lord
Gosford--namely, to hand over to the Assembly the control of the
hereditary, territorial, and casual revenues of the Crown, on condition
that the Assembly would grant a permanent civil list.But the main
feature of the resolutions was the clause empowering the governor to
pay out of the public revenues, without authorization of the Assembly,
the moneys necessary for defraying the cost of government in the
province up to April 10, 1837.This, though not exactly a suspension
of the constitution of Lower Canada and a measure quite legally within
the competency of the House of Commons, was a flat negative to the
claim of the Lower-Canadian Assembly to control over the executive
government, through the power of the purse or otherwise.A long and important debate in Parliament followed on these
resolutions.Some of the chief political leaders of the day took part
in the discussion.Daniel O'Connell, the great {60} tribune of the
Irish people, took up the cudgels for the French Canadians.Doubtless
it seemed to him that the French Canadians, like the Irish, were
victims of Anglo-Saxon tyranny and bigotry.Sir George Grey, the
colleague of Gosford, Lord Stanley, a former colonial secretary, and
William Ewart Gladstone, then a vigorous young Tory, spoke in support
of the resolutions.The chief opposition came from the Radical wing of
the Whig party, headed by Hume and Roebuck; but these members were
comparatively few in number, and the resolutions were passed by
overwhelming majorities.From a print in the Chateau de Ramezay.]As soon as the passage of the resolutions became known in Canada,
Papineau and his friends began to set the heather on fire.On May 7,
1837, the _Patriotes_ held a huge open-air meeting at St Ours, eleven
miles above Sorel on the river Richelieu.The chief organizer of the
meeting was Dr Wolfred Nelson, a member of the Assembly living in the
neighbouring village of St Denis, who was destined to be one of the
leaders of the revolt at the end of the year.Papineau himself was
present at the meeting and he spoke in his usual violent strain.He
submitted a resolution declaring that 'we cannot but {61} consider a
government which has recourse to injustice, to force, and to a
violation of the social contract, anything else than an oppressive
government, a government by force, for which the measure of our
submission should henceforth be simply the measure of our numerical
strength, in combination with the sympathy we may find elsewhere.'At
St Laurent a week later he used language no less dangerous.'The
Russell resolutions,' he cried, 'are a foul stain; the people should
not, and will not, submit to them; the people must transmit their just
rights to their posterity, even though it cost them their property and
their lives to do so.'All over the
province the _Patriotes_ met together to protest against what they
called 'coercion.'As a rule the meetings were held in the country
parishes after church on Sunday, when the habitants were gathered
together.Most inflammatory language was used, and flags and placards
were displayed bearing such devices as '_Papineau et le systeme
electif_,' '_Papineau et l'independence_,' and '_A bas le despotisme_.'Alarmed by such language, Lord Gosford issued on June 15 a proclamation
calling on all loyal {62} subjects to discountenance writings of a
seditious tendency, and to avoid meetings of a turbulent or political
character.But the proclamation produced no abatement in the
agitation; it merely offered one more subject for denunciation.During this period Papineau and his friends continually drew their
inspiration from the procedure of the Whigs in the American colonies
before 1776.The resolutions of the _Patriotes_ recalled the language
of the Declaration of Independence.One of the first measures of the
Americans had been to boycott English goods; one of the first measures
of the _Patriotes_ was a resolution passed at St Ours binding them to
forswear the use of imported English goods and to use only the products
of Canadian industry.At the short and abortive session of the
legislature which took place at the end of the summer of 1837, nearly
all the members of the Assembly appeared in clothes made of Canadian
frieze.The shifts of some of the members to avoid wearing English
imported articles were rather amusing.'Mr Rodier's dress,' said the
Quebec _Mercury_, 'excited the greatest attention, being unique with
the exception of a pair of Berlin gloves, viz.: frock coat of {63}
granite colored _etoffe du pays_; inexpressibles and vest of the same
material, striped blue and white; straw hat, and beef shoes, with a
pair of home-made socks, completed the _outre_ attire.Mr Rodier, it
was remarked, had no shirt on, having doubtless been unable to smuggle
or manufacture one.'But Louis LaFontaine and 'Beau' Viger limited
their patriotism, it appears, to the wearing of Canadian-made
waistcoats.The imitation of the American revolutionists did not end
here.If the New England colonies had their 'Sons of Liberty,' Lower
Canada had its '_Fils de la Liberte_'--an association formed in
Montreal in the autumn of 1837.And the Lower Canada Patriotes
outstripped the New England patriots in the republican character of
their utterances.'Our only hope,' announced _La Minerve_, 'is to
elect our governor ourselves, or, in other words, to cease to belong to
the British Empire.'A manifesto of some of the younger spirits of the
_Patriote_ party, issued on October 1, 1837, spoke of 'proud designs,
which in our day must emancipate our beloved country from all human
authority except that of the bold democracy residing within its bosom.'To add point to these opinions, there sprang up all over the country
{64} volunteer companies of armed _Patriotes_, led and organized by
militia officers who had been dismissed for seditious utterances.Naturally, this situation caused much concern among the loyal people of
the country.Loyalist meetings were held in Quebec and Montreal, to
offset the _Patriote_ meetings; and an attempt was made to form a
loyalist rifle corps in Montreal.The attempt failed owing to the
opposition of the governor, who was afraid that such a step would
merely aggravate the situation.Not even Gosford, however, was blind
to the seriousness of the situation.He wrote to the colonial
secretary on September 2, 1837, that all hope of conciliation had
passed.Papineau's aims were now the separation of Canada from England
and the establishment of a republican form of government.'I am
disposed to think,' he concluded, 'that you may be under the necessity
of suspending the constitution.'It was at this time that the Church first threw its weight openly
against the revolutionary movement.The British government had
accorded to Catholics in Canada a measure of liberty at once just and
generous; and the bishops and clergy were not slow to see that under a
republican form of government, {65} whether as a state in the American
Union or as an independent _nation canadienne_, they might be much
worse off, and would not be any better off, than under the dominion of
Great Britain.In the summer of 1837 Mgr Lartigue, the bishop of
Montreal, addressed a communication to the clergy of his diocese asking
them to keep the people within the path of duty.In October he
followed this up by a Pastoral Letter, to be read in all the churches,
warning the people against the sin of rebellion.He held over those
who contemplated rebellion the penalties of the Church: 'The present
question amounts to nothing less than this--whether you will choose to
maintain, or whether you will choose to abandon, the laws of your
religion.'The ecclesiastical authorities were roused to action by a great meeting
held on October 23, at St Charles on the Richelieu, the largest and
most imposing of all the meetings thus far.Five or six thousand
people attended it, representing all the counties about the Richelieu.Dr Wolfred Nelson was in the
chair, but Papineau was the central figure.A company of armed men,
headed by two militia officers who had been dismissed for disloyalty,
and {66} drawn up as a guard, saluted every resolution of the meeting
with a volley.A wooden pillar, with a cap of liberty on top, was
erected, and dedicated to Papineau.At the end of the proceedings
Papineau was led up to the column to receive an address.After this
all present marched past singing popular airs; and each man placed his
hand on the column, swearing to be faithful to the cause of his
country, and to conquer or die for her.All this, of course, was
comparatively innocent.The resolutions, too, were not more violent
than many others which had been passed elsewhere.Nor did Papineau use
language more extreme than usual.Many of the _Patriotes_, indeed,
considered his speech too moderate.He deprecated any recourse to arms
and advised his hearers merely to boycott English goods, in order to
bring the government to righteousness.But some of his lieutenants
used language which seemed dangerous.Roused by the eloquence of their
leader, they went further than he would venture, and advocated an
appeal to the arbitrament of war.'The time has come,' cried Wolfred
Nelson, 'to melt our spoons into bullets.'The exact attitude of Papineau during {67} these months of agitation is
difficult to determine.He does not seem to have been quite clear as
to what course he should pursue.He had completely lost faith in
British justice.He earnestly desired the emancipation of Canada from
British rule and the establishment of a republican system of
government.But he could not make up his mind to commit himself to
armed rebellion.'I must say, however,' he had announced at St
Laurent, 'and it is neither fear nor scruple that makes me do so, that
the day has not yet come for us to respond to that appeal.'The same
attitude is apparent, in spite of the haughty and defiant language, in
the letter which he addressed to the governor's secretary in answer to
an inquiry as to what he had said at St Laurent:


SIR,--The pretension of the governor to interrogate me respecting my
conduct at St Laurent on the 15th of May last is an impertinence which
I repel with contempt and silence.I, however, take the pen merely to tell the governor that it is false
that any of the resolutions adopted at the meeting of the county of
Montreal, held at St Laurent {68} on the 15th May last, recommend a
violation of the laws, as in his ignorance he may believe, or as he at
least asserts.--Your obedient servant,

L. J. PAPINEAU.At St Charles Papineau was even more precise in repudiating revolution;
and there is no evidence that, when rebellion was decided upon,
Papineau played any important part in laying the plans.In later years
he was always emphatic in denying that the rebellion of 1837 had been
primarily his handiwork.'I was,' he said in 1847, 'neither more nor
less guilty, nor more nor less deserving, than a great number of my
colleagues.'The truth seems to be that Papineau always balked a
little at the idea of armed rebellion, and that he was carried off his
feet at the end of 1837 by his younger associates, whose enthusiasm he
himself had inspired.He had raised the wind, but he could not ride
the whirlwind.[Illustration: South-Western Lower Canada, 1837.]{69}

CHAPTER VIII

THE DOGS OF WAR

As the autumn of 1837 wore on, the situation in Lower Canada began to
assume an aspect more and more threatening.In spite of a proclamation
from the governor forbidding such meetings, the _Patriotes_ continued
to gather for military drill and musketry exercises.Armed bands went
about the countryside, in many places intimidating the loyalists and
forcing loyal magistrates and militia officers to send in their
resignations to the governor.As early as July some of the Scottish
settlers at Cote St Joseph, near St Eustache, had fled from their
homes, leaving their property to its fate.Several houses at Cote St
Mary had been fired upon or broken into.A letter of Sir John
Colborne, the commander of the forces in British North America, written
on October 6, shows what the state of affairs was at that time:


In my correspondence with Col.Eden I have had occasion to refer to the
facts {70} and reports that establish the decided character which the
agitators have lately assumed.The people have elected the dismissed
officers of the militia to command them.At St Ours a pole has been
erected in favour of a dismissed captain with this inscription on it,
'Elu par le peuple.'At St Hyacinthe the tri-coloured flag was
displayed for several days.Two families have quitted the town in
consequence of the annoyance they received from the patriots.Wolfred
Nelson warned the patriots at a public meeting to be ready to arm.The
tri-coloured flag is to be seen at two taverns between St Denis and St
Charles.Many of the tavern-keepers have discontinued their signs and
substituted for them an eagle.The bank notes or promissory notes
issued at Yamaska have also the same emblem marked on them.Mr
Papineau was escorted from Yamaska to St Denis by a numerous retinue,
and it is said that 200 or 300 carriages accompanied him on his route.He has attended five public meetings lately; and at one of them La
Valtrie, a priest, was insulted in his presence.The occurrence at St
Denis was certainly {71} a political affair, a family at St Antoine
opposed to the proceedings of W. Nelson, having been annoyed by the
same mob that destroyed the house of Madame St Jacques a few hours
before the shot was fired from her window.Special animosity was shown toward the Chouayens, those French
Canadians who had refused to follow Papineau's lead.P. D. Debartzch,
a legislative councillor and a former supporter of Papineau, who had
withdrawn his support after the passing of the Ninety-Two Resolutions,
was obliged to flee from his home at St Charles; and Dr Quesnel, one of
the magistrates of L'Acadie, had his house broken into by a mob that
demanded his resignation as magistrate.On November 6 rioting broke out in Montreal.The Doric Club, an
organization of the young men of English blood in the city, came into
conflict with the French-Canadian _Fils de la Liberte_.Which side
provoked the hostilities, it is now difficult to say.Certainly, both
sides were to blame for their behaviour during the day.The sons of
liberty broke the windows of prominent loyalists; and the members of
the Doric Club completely wrecked {72} the office of the _Vindicator_
newspaper.It was only when the Riot Act was read, and the troops were
called out, that the rioting ceased.Up to this point the _Patriotes_ had not indulged in any overt acts of
armed rebellion.Some of their leaders, it is true, had been laying
plans for a revolt.So much is known from the correspondence which
passed between the leading _Patriotes_ in Lower Canada and William Lyon
Mackenzie, the leader of the rebellion in Upper Canada.Thomas Storrow
Brown, one of Papineau's lieutenants, wrote to Mackenzie asking him to
start the ball rolling in Upper Canada first, in order to draw off some
of the troops which Sir John Colborne had massed in Lower Canada.But
all calculations were now upset by events which rapidly precipitated
the crisis in the lower province.Soon after the fracas in the streets of Montreal between the Doric Club
and the _Fils de la Liberte_, a priest named Quibilier waited on
Papineau, and advised him, since his presence in Montreal had become a
source of disturbance, to leave the city.Whether he came as an
emissary from the ecclesiastical authorities or merely as a friend is
not clear.At any rate, Papineau accepted his advice, {73} and
immediately set out for St Hyacinthe.The government, thinking that Papineau had left the city for the
purpose of stirring up trouble in the Richelieu district, promptly
issued warrants for the arrest of Papineau and some of his chief
lieutenants, Dr Wolfred Nelson, Thomas Storrow Brown, Edmund Bailey
O'Callaghan, and several others.Meanwhile, on the day that these warrants for arrest were being issued
(November 16), a skirmish took place between a small party of British
troopers and a band of _Patriotes_ on the road between Chambly and
Longueuil--a skirmish which may be described as the Lexington of the
Lower Canada rebellion.The troopers, under Lieutenant Ermatinger, had
been sent to St Johns to arrest two French Canadians, named Demaray and
Davignon, who had been intimidating the magistrates.The arrest had
been effected, and the party were on their way back to Montreal, when
they were confronted by an armed company of _Patriotes_, under the
command of Bonaventure Viger, who demanded the release of the
prisoners.A brisk skirmish ensued, in which several on both sides
were wounded.The troopers, outnumbered by at least five {74} to one,
and having nothing but pistols with which to reply to the fire of
muskets and fowling-pieces, were easily routed; and the two prisoners
were liberated.The news of this affair spread rapidly through the parishes, and
greatly encouraged the _Patriotes_ to resist the arrest of Papineau and
his lieutenants.Papineau, Nelson, Brown, and O'Callaghan had all
evaded the sheriff's officer, and had taken refuge in the country about
the Richelieu, the heart of the revolutionary district.In a day or
two word came to Montreal that considerable numbers of armed habitants
had gathered at the villages of St Denis and St Charles, evidently with
the intention of preventing the arrest of their leaders.The force at
St Denis was under the command of Wolfred Nelson, and that at St
Charles was under the command of Thomas Storrow Brown.How these
self-styled 'generals' came to be appointed is somewhat of a mystery.Brown, at any rate, seems to have been chosen for the position on the
spur of the moment.'A mere accident took me to St Charles,' he wrote
afterwards, 'and put me at the head of a revolting force.'Sir John Colborne, who was in command of the British military forces,
immediately {75} determined to disperse these gatherings by force and
to arrest their leaders.A force
consisting of one regiment of infantry, a troop of the Montreal
Volunteer Cavalry, and two light field-guns, under the command of
Lieutenant-Colonel Wetherall, had already been dispatched to Chambly by
way of the road on which the rescue of Demaray and Davignon had taken
place.Another force,
consisting of five companies of the 24th regiment, with a
twelve-pounder, under Colonel Charles Gore, a Waterloo veteran, would
proceed by boat to Sorel.There it was to be joined by one company of
the 66th regiment, then in garrison at Sorel, and the combined force
would march on St Denis.After having dispersed the rebels at St
Denis, which was thought not to be strongly held, the little army was
to proceed to St Charles, where it would be joined by the force under
Wetherall.At eight o'clock on the evening of November 22, Colonel Gore set out
with his men from the barrack-square at Sorel for St Denis.The
journey was one of eighteen miles; and in order to avoid St Ours, which
was held by the _Patriotes_, Gore turned away from the main {76} road
along the Richelieu to make a detour.This led his troops over very
bad roads.The night was dark and rain poured down in torrents.'I
got a lantern,' wrote one of Gore's aides-de-camp afterwards, 'fastened
it to the top of a pole, and had it carried in front of the column; but
what with horses and men sinking in the mud, harness breaking, wading
through water and winding through woods, the little force soon got
separated, those in the rear lost sight of the light, and great delays
and difficulties were experienced.Towards morning the rain changed to
snow, it became very cold, and daybreak found the unfortunate column
still floundering in the half-frozen mud four miles from St Denis.'Meanwhile word had reached the rebels of the coming of the soldiers.At daybreak Dr Wolfred Nelson had ridden out to reconnoitre, and had
succeeded in destroying several bridges.As the soldiers approached St
Denis they heard the church bells ringing the alarm; and it was not
long before they found that the village was strongly defended.After
capturing some of the houses on the outskirts of the village, they were
halted by a stockade built across the road covered by a large brick
house, well fortified on all sides.The commander of {77} the troops
brought reinforcements up to the firing line, and the twelve-pounder
came into action.But the assailants made very little impression on
the defence.Although the engagement lasted for more than five hours,
the troops succeeded in capturing nothing more than one of the flanking
houses.The ammunition of the British was running low, and the numbers
of the insurgents seemed to be increasing.Colonel Gore therefore
deemed it advisable to retire.By some strange oversight the British
were without any ambulance or transport of any kind; and they were
compelled to leave their dead and wounded behind them.Their
casualties were six killed and eighteen wounded.The wounded, it is a
pleasure to be able to say, were well looked after by the victorious
_Patriotes_.The British effected their retreat with great steadiness, despite the
fact that the men had had no food since the previous day and had been
marching all night.They were compelled to abandon their
twelve-pounder in the mud; but they reached St Ours that night without
further loss.The next day they were back at Sorel.The number of the insurgents at St Denis has never been accurately
ascertained; {78} probably they were considerably in excess of the
troops.Their position was one of great strength, and good judgment
had been shown in fortifying it.On the other hand, with the exception
of a few veterans of Major de Salaberry's Voltigeurs, they were
untrained in war; and their muskets and fowling-pieces were much
inferior to the rifles of the regulars.Their victory, it must be
said, reflected great credit upon them; although their losses had been
twice as great as those of the soldiers,[1] these peasants in homespun
had stood their ground with a courage and steadiness which would have
honoured old campaigners.The same, unfortunately, cannot be said
about some of their leaders.Papineau and O'Callaghan were present in
St Denis when the attack began; but before the morning was well
advanced, they had departed for St Hyacinthe, whence they later fled to
the United States.Papineau always declared that he had taken this
action at the {79} solicitation of Wolfred Nelson, who had said to him:
'Do not expose yourself uselessly: you will be of more service to us
after the fight than here.'In later days, however, when political
differences had arisen between the two men, Nelson denied having given
Papineau any such advice.But
even if Nelson did advise Papineau to leave, it cannot be said that
Papineau consulted his own reputation in accepting the advice.He was
not a person without military experience: he had been a major in the
militia, and was probably superior in rank to any one in the village.His place was with the brave farmers who had taken up arms on his
behalf.An episode in connection with the attack on St Denis left a dark stain
on the _Patriote_ escutcheon and embittered greatly the relations
between the two races in Canada.This was the murder, on the morning
of the fight, of Lieutenant Weir, a subaltern in the 32nd regiment, who
had been sent with dispatches to Sorel by land.He had reached Sorel
half an hour after Colonel Gore and his men had departed for St Denis.In attempting to catch up with Gore's column he had taken the direct
road to St Denis and had arrived there {80} in advance of the British
troops.On approaching the village he was arrested, and by Wolfred
Nelson's orders placed in detention.As the British attack developed,
it was thought better by those who had him in charge to remove him to
St Charles.They bound him tightly and placed him in a wagon.Hardly
had they started when he made an attempt to escape.In this emergency
his warders seem to have lost their heads.In spite of the fact that
Weir was tightly bound and could do no harm, they fell upon him with
swords and pistols, and in a short time dispatched him.Then, appalled
at what they had done, they attempted to hide the body.When the
British troops entered St Denis a week later, they found the body
lying, weighted down with stones, in the Richelieu river under about
two feet of water.The autopsy disclosed the brutality with which Weir
had been murdered; and the sight of the body so infuriated the soldiers
that they gave the greater part of the village of St Denis to the
flames.In the later phases of the rebellion the slogan of the British
soldiers was, 'Remember Jack Weir.'Another atrocious murder even more unpardonable than that of Weir was
perpetrated {81} a few days later.On November 28 some _Patriotes_
near St Johns captured a man by the name of Chartrand, who was enlisted
in a loyal volunteer corps of the district.After a mock trial
Chartrand was tied to a tree and shot by his own countrymen.[1] According to a report twelve _Patriotes_ lost their lives during
the engagement.Among them was Charles Ovide Perrault, member of the
Assembly for Vaudreuil, a young barrister of considerable promise.He
seems to have been Papineau's closest follower and confidant During the
last sessions of the Lower Canada legislature Perrault contributed many
letters to _La Minerve_.{82}

CHAPTER IX

_FORCE MAJEURE_

The check administered to Colonel Gore's column at St Denis, in the
first engagement of the rebellion, was the only victory which fell to
the rebel forces.In the meantime Lieutenant-Colonel Wetherall, with
several companies of infantry, a troop of volunteer cavalry, and two
field-guns, was marching on St Charles.On the evening of November 22
Major Gugy, the leader of the English party in the Assembly, had
brought to Wetherall at Chambly instructions to advance down the
Richelieu and attack the rebel position at St Charles in the morning.He set out accordingly at about the hour when Gore headed his forces up
the river from Sorel.But, while Gore carried out his orders to the
letter and reached St Denis on the morning of the 23rd, Wetherall
allowed himself some latitude in interpreting his instructions.This
was largely due to the advice of Gugy, if we are to believe {83} the
account which Gugy has left us.'In the first place,' it runs, 'not
one of the force knew anything of the roads or people, nor do I believe
that more than one spoke French....  The storm raged so fearfully, the
rain poured in such torrents, and the frost set in afterwards so
intensely, that... men and horses were equally fatigued... all so
exhausted as to be unable to cope, on broken or woody ground,
successfully with any resolute enemy....  I learned that we had marched
without a dollar, without a loaf of bread, without a commissary, and
without a spare cartridge--a pretty predicament in an enemy's country,
surrounded by thousands of armed men.'It was apparent to Gugy that
Sir John Colborne, in issuing his orders, had greatly underestimated
the difficulty of the task he was setting for the troops.After
crossing the river above the Chambly Basin, Gugy therefore induced
Wetherall to halt until daylight; and, turning himself into a
commissary, he billeted the men and horses in the neighbouring houses
and stables.The next day about noon the column reached St Hilaire, some seven miles
from St Charles.Here Wetherall obtained information which led him to
fear that Gore {84} had met with some kind of check; and he was
persuaded to send back to Chambly for a reinforcement of one company
which had been left in garrison there.His messenger reached Chambly
at four o'clock on the morning of the 24th.Major Warde, the
commandant at Chambly, at once embarked his company on a scow and
dropped down the river to St Hilaire; but he arrived too late to allow
of any further action that day, and it was not until the morning of the
25th that the column moved on St Charles.Meanwhile, the rebels had been making preparations for defence.They
had fortified the manor-house of Debartzch, who had fled to Montreal,
and built round it a rampart of earth and tree-trunks--a rampart which,
for some mysterious reason, was never completed.They appointed as
commander Thomas Storrow Brown, a Montreal iron-merchant, for whose
arrest a warrant had been issued and who had fled to St Charles with
two or three other _Patriote_ politicians.But Brown had no military
experience, and was still suffering so severely from injuries received
in the rioting in Montreal that his proper place was a home for
convalescents rather than a field of battle.His appointment can only
be {85} explained by the non-appearance of the local _Patriote_
leaders.'The chief men,' Brown testified afterwards, 'were, with two
or three exceptions, absent or hiding.'It is evident that the British
authorities expected to meet with the strongest opposition at St
Charles, since that place had been the scene of the great demonstration
earlier in the year.But, as a matter of fact, the rebel forces at St
Charles were much less formidable than those at St Denis.Not only
were they lacking in proper military leadership; they were also fewer
in number and were, moreover, very inadequately armed.If Brown's
statements are to be relied upon, there were not in the rebel camp two
hundred men.'Of ammunition,' wrote Brown, 'we had some half dozen
kegs of gunpowder and a little lead, which was cast into bullets; but
as the fire-arms were of every calibre, the cartridges made were too
large for many, which were consequently useless.We had two small
rusty field-pieces, but with neither carriages nor appointments they
were as useless as two logs.There was one old musket, but not a
bayonet.The fire-arms were common flintlocks, in all conditions of
dilapidation, some tied together with string, and very many with {86}
lock-springs so worn out that they could not be discharged.'On the 24th Brown made a reconnaissance in the direction of St Hilaire.He destroyed a bridge over a ravine some distance to the south of St
Charles, and placed above it an outpost with orders to prevent a
reconstruction of the bridge.But when the British troops appeared on
the morning of the 25th, this and other outlying pickets fell back
without making any resistance.They probably saw that they were so
outnumbered that resistance would be hopeless.On the approach of the
troops Brown at first assumed an attitude of confidence.A messenger
came from Wetherall, 'a respectable old habitant,' to tell the rebels
that if they dispersed quietly, they would not be molested.Brown
treated the message as a confession of weakness.'I at once supposed,'
he said, 'that, followed in the rear by our friends from above, they
were seeking a free passage to Sorel, and determined to send a message,
that _if they would lay down their arms, they should pass unmolested_.'This message does not seem to have reached its destination.And hardly
had the engagement opened when Brown quickly changed his tune.'To go
forward {87} was useless, as I could order nothing but a
retreat--without it the people commenced retiring.I tried to rally
the little squads, my only hope being in keeping together the
fowling-pieces we had collected, but finding, after a long trial, my
strength and authority insufficient, I considered my command gone,
turned my horse, and rode to... St Denis (seven or eight miles), where
... I arrived about nightfall.'The rebels, or at any rate
those of them who were armed, seem to have been outnumbered by the
soldiers, of whom there were between three and four hundred.But the
fighting was apparently brisk while it lasted.The British lost three
killed and eighteen wounded.The _Patriote_ losses are not known.The
local tradition is that forty-two were killed and many more wounded.We know that thirty were taken prisoners on the field.The defeat of the rebels at St Charles really terminated the rebellion
in the country about the Richelieu.When news of the defeat spread
over the countryside, the _Patriote_ forces immediately disbanded, and
their leaders sought safety in flight.Papineau and O'Callaghan, who
had been at St Hyacinthe, {88} succeeded in getting across the Vermont
border; but Wolfred Nelson was not so fortunate.After suffering great
privations he was captured by some loyalist militia not far from the
frontier, taken to Montreal, and there lodged in prison.For some reason which it is difficult to discern, Wetherall did not
march on from St Charles to effect a pacification of St Denis.On
December 1, however, Colonel Gore once more set out from Sorel, and
entered St Denis the same day.He
recovered the howitzer and five of the wounded men he had left behind.In spite of the absence of opposition, his men took advantage of the
occasion to wreak an unfair and un-British vengeance on the helpless
victors of yesterday.Goaded to fury by the sight of young Weir's
mangled body, they set fire to a large part of the village.Colonel
Gore afterwards repudiated the charge that he had ordered the burning
of the houses of the insurgents; but that defence does not absolve him
from blame.It is obvious, at any rate, that he did not take adequate
measures to prevent such excesses; nor was any punishment ever
administered to those who applied the torch.{89}

But the end of rebellion was not yet in sight.Two more encounters
remain to be described.The first of these occurred at a place known
as Moore's Corners, near the Vermont border.After the collapse at St
Charles a number of _Patriote_ refugees had gathered at the small town
of Swanton, a few miles south of Missisquoi Bay, on the American side
of the boundary-line.Among them were Dr Cyrile Cote and Edouard
Rodier, both members of the Lower Canada Assembly; Ludger Duvernay, a
member of the Assembly and editor of _La Minerve_; Dr Kimber, one of
the ringleaders in the rescue of Demaray and Davignon; and Robert Shore
Milnes Bouchette, the descendant of a French-Canadian family long
conspicuous for its loyalty and its services to the state.Bouchette's
grandfather had been instrumental in effecting the escape of Sir Guy
Carleton from Montreal in 1775, when that place was threatened by the
forces of Montgomery.The grandson's social tastes and affiliations
might have led one to expect that he would have been found in the ranks
of the loyalists; but the arbitrary policy of the Russell Resolutions
had driven him into the arms of the extreme _Patriotes_.Arrested for
disloyalty at the outbreak of {90} the rebellion, he had been admitted
to bail and had escaped.These men, under the belief that the
habitants would rise and join them, determined upon an armed invasion
of Canada.Possibly they believed also that Wolfred Nelson was still
holding out.Papineau, it was said, had reported that 'the victor of
St Denis' was entrenched with a considerable force at St Cesaire on the
Yamaska.They therefore collected arms and ammunition, sent emissaries
through the parishes to the north to rouse the _Patriotes_, and on
December 6, flying some colours which had been worked for them by the
enthusiastic ladies of Swanton, they crossed the Canadian border, about
two hundred strong.They had two field-pieces and a supply of muskets
and ammunition for those whom they expected to join the party on
Canadian soil.Hardly had the invaders crossed the border when they encountered at
Moore's Corners a body of the Missisquoi Volunteers, under the command
of Captain Kemp, who were acting as escort to a convoy of arms and
ammunition.Having received warning of the coming of the insurgents,
Kemp had sent out messengers through the countryside to rouse the
loyalist {91} population.To these as they arrived he served out the
muskets in his wagons.And when the rebels appeared, about eight
o'clock at night, he had a force at his disposal of at least three
hundred men, all well armed.There is reason for believing that Kemp might have succeeded in
ambushing the advancing force, had not some of his men, untrained
volunteers with muskets in their hands for the first time, opened fire
prematurely.The rebels returned the fire, and a fusillade continued
for ten or fifteen minutes.But the rebels, on perceiving that they
had met a superior force, retired in great haste, leaving behind them
one dead and two wounded.One of the wounded was Bouchette, who had
been in command of the advance-guard.The rebels abandoned also their
two field-pieces, about forty stand of arms, five kegs of gunpowder,
and six boxes of ball-cartridge, as well as two standards.Among the
loyalists there were no casualties whatever.Only three of the rebels
were taken prisoner besides the two wounded, a fact which Kemp
explained by several factors--the undisciplined state of the loyalists,
the darkness of the night, the vicinity of woods, and the proximity of
the boundary-line, {92} beyond which he did not allow the pursuit to
go.The 'battle' of Moore's Corners was in truth an excellent farce;
but there is no doubt that it prevented what might have been a more
serious encounter had the rebel column reached the neighbourhood of St
Johns, where many of the _Patriotes_ were in readiness to join them.A few days later, in a part of the province some distance removed from
the Richelieu river and the Vermont border, there occurred another
collision, perhaps the most formidable of the whole rebellion.This
was at the village of St Eustache, in the county of Two Mountains,
about eighteen miles north-west of Montreal.The county of Two
Mountains had long been known as a stronghold of the extreme
_Patriotes_.The local member, W. H. Scott, was a supporter of
Papineau, and had a large and enthusiastic following.He was not,
however, a leader in the troubles that ensued.The chief organizer of
revolt in St Eustache and the surrounding country was a mysterious
adventurer named Amury Girod, who arrived in St Eustache toward the end
of November with credentials, it would seem from Papineau, assigning to
him the task of superintending the _Patriote_ cause {93} in the north.He is variously described as having
been a Swiss, an Alsatian, and a native of Louisiana.According to his
own statement, he had been at one time a lieutenant-colonel of cavalry
in Mexico.He was well educated, could speak fluently several
languages, had a bold and plausible manner, and succeeded in imposing,
not only upon the _Patriote_ leaders, but upon the people of St
Eustache.He found a capable and dauntless supporter in Dr J. O.
Chenier, the young physician of the village.Chenier was one of the
few leaders of the revolt whose courage challenges admiration; and it
is fitting that to-day a monument, bearing the simple inscription
CHENIER, should stand in the Place Viger in Montreal, among the people
for whom, though misguidedly and recklessly, he laid down his life.To St Eustache, on Sunday, November 26, came the news of Wolfred
Nelson's victory at St Denis.On Monday and Tuesday bands of
_Patriotes_ went about the countryside, terrorizing and disarming the
loyalists and compelling the faint-hearted to join in the rising.On
Wednesday night the rebels gathered to the number of about four hundred
{94} in St Eustache, and got noisily drunk (_s'y enivrerent
bruyamment_).They then proceeded, under the command of Girod and
Chenier, to the Indian mission settlement at the Lake of Two Mountains.Here they broke into the government stores and possessed themselves of
some guns and ammunition.They next made themselves unwelcome to the
superior of the mission, the Abbe Dufresne, and, in spite of his
protestations, carried off from the mission-house a three-pounder gun.On their return to St Eustache they forcibly entered the convent which
had been lately completed, though it was not yet occupied, and camped
there.The loyalists who were forced to flee from the village carried the news
of these proceedings to Montreal; but Sir John Colborne was unwilling
to take any steps to subdue the _Patriotes_ of St Eustache until the
insurrection on the Richelieu had been thoroughly crushed.All he did
was to send a detachment of volunteers to guard the Bord a Plouffe
bridge at the northern end of the island of Montreal.On Sunday, December 3, word reached St Eustache of the defeat of the
insurgents at St Charles.This had a moderating influence on many of
the _Patriotes_.All week the Abbe {95} Paquin, parish priest of St
Eustache, had been urging the insurgents to go back quietly to their
homes.He begged Chenier to cease
his revolutionary conduct.Chenier, however, was immovable.He
refused to believe that the rebels at St Charles had been dispersed,
and announced his determination to die with arms in his hands rather
than surrender.'You might as well try to seize the moon with your
teeth,' he exclaimed, 'as to try to shake my resolve.'The events of the days that followed cannot be chronicled in detail.When the Abbe Paquin and his vicar Deseves sought to leave the parish,
Girod and Chenier virtually placed them under arrest.The abbe did not
mince matters with Chenier.'I accuse you before God and man,' he
said, 'of being the author of these misfortunes.'When some of the
habitants came to him complaining that they had been forced against
their will to join the rebels, he reminded them of the English proverb:
'You may lead a horse to the water, but you cannot make him drink.'Unfortunately, the Abbe Paquin's good influence was counteracted by
that of the Abbe Chartier, the cure of the neighbouring village of St
{96} Benoit, a rare case of an ecclesiastic lending his support to the
rebel movement, in direct contravention of the orders of his superiors.On several occasions the Abbe Chartier came over to St Eustache and
delivered inflammatory addresses to the rebel levies.The vicar Deseves has left us a vivid picture of the life which the
rebels led.No attempt was made to drill them or to exercise
discipline.He continually saw them,
he says, passing through the village in knots of five or six, carrying
rusty guns out of order, smoking short black pipes, and wearing blue
_tuques_ which hung half-way down their backs, clothes of _etoffe du
pays_, and leather mittens.They helped themselves to all the strong
drink they could lay their hands on, and their gait showed the
influence of their potations.Their chief aim in life seemed to be to
steal, to drink, to eat, to dance, and to quarrel.With regard to the
morrow, they lived in a fool's paradise.They seem to have believed
that the troops would not dare to come out to meet them, and that when
their leaders should give the word they would advance on Montreal and
take it without difficulty.Their numbers during this period showed a
good deal of {97} fluctuation.Ultimately Girod succeeded in gathering
about him nearly a thousand men.Not all these, however, were armed;
according to Deseves a great many of them had no weapons but sticks and
stones.By December 13 Sir John Colborne was ready to move.He had provided
himself with a force strong enough to crush an enemy several times more
numerous than the insurgents led by Girod and Chenier.His column was
composed of the 1st Royals, the 32nd regiment, the 83rd regiment, the
Montreal Volunteer Rifles, Globensky and Leclerc's Volunteers, a strong
force of cavalry--in all, over two thousand men, supported by eight
pieces of field artillery and well supplied with provision and
ammunition transport.The troops bivouacked for the night at St Martin, and advanced on the
morning of the 14th.The main body crossed the Mille Isles river on
the ice about four miles to the east of St Eustache, and then moved
westward along the St Rose road.A detachment of Globensky's
Volunteers, however, followed the direct road to St Eustache, and came
out on the south side of the river opposite the village, in full view
of the rebels.Chenier, at the head of a hundred and fifty men,
crossed the {98} ice, and was on the point of coming to close quarters
with the volunteers when the main body of the loyalists appeared to the
east.Thereupon Chenier and his men beat a hasty retreat, and made
hurried preparations for defending the village.The church, the
convent, the presbytery, and the house of the member of the Assembly,
Scott, were all occupied and barricaded.It was about the church that
the fiercest fighting took place.The artillery was brought to bear on
the building; but the stout masonry resisted the battering of the
cannon balls, and is still standing, dinted and scarred.Some of the
Royals then got into the presbytery and set fire to it.Under cover of
the smoke the rest of the regiment then doubled up the street to the
church door.Gaining access through the sacristy, they lit a fire
behind the altar.'The firing from the church windows then ceased,'
wrote one of the officers afterwards, 'and the rebels began running out
from some low windows, apparently of a crypt or cellar.Our men formed
up on one side of the church, and the 32nd and 83rd on the other.Some
of the rebels ran out and fired at the troops, then threw down their
arms and begged for quarter.Our officers tried to save the {99}
Canadians, but the men shouted "Remember Jack Weir," and numbers of
these poor deluded fellows were shot down.'He had jumped from a window of the
Blessed Virgin's chapel and was making for the cemetery.How many fell
with him it is difficult to say.It was said that seventy rebels were
killed, and a number of charred bodies were found afterwards in the
ruins of the church.The casualties among the troops were slight, one
killed and nine wounded.One of the wounded was Major Gugy, who here
distinguished himself by his bravery and kind-heartedness, as he had
done in the St Charles expedition.A good
many, indeed, had fled from the village on the first appearance of the
troops.Among these were some who had played a conspicuous part in
fomenting trouble.The Abbe Chartier of St Benoit, instead of waiting
to administer the last rites to the dying, beat a feverish retreat and
eventually escaped to the United States.The Church placed on him its
interdict, and he never again set foot on Canadian soil.The behaviour
of the adventurer Girod, the 'general' of the rebel force, was
especially {100} reprehensible.When he had posted his men in the
church and the surrounding buildings, he mounted a horse and fled
toward St Benoit.At a tavern where he stopped to get a stiff draught
of spirits he announced that the rebels had been victorious and that he
was seeking reinforcements with which to crush the troops completely.Then, finding that the cordon was
tightening around him, he blew out his brains with a revolver.Thus
ended a life which was not without its share of romance and mystery.On the night of the 14th the troops encamped near the desolate village
of St Eustache, a large part of which had unfortunately been given over
to the flames during the engagement.In the morning the column set out
for St Benoit.Sir John Colborne had threatened that if a single shot
were fired from St Benoit the village would be given over to fire and
pillage.But when the troops arrived there they found awaiting them
about two hundred and fifty men bearing white flags.All the villagers
laid down their arms and made an unqualified submission.And it is a
matter for profound regret that, notwithstanding this, the greater part
of the village {101} was burned to the ground.Sir John Colborne has
been severely censured for this occurrence, and not without reason.Nothing is more certain, of course, than that he did not order it.It
seems to have been the work of the loyalist volunteers, who had without
doubt suffered much at the hands of the rebels.'The irregular troops
employed,' wrote one of the British officers, 'were not to be
controlled, and were in every case, I believe, the instrument of the
infliction.'Far too much burning and pillaging went on, indeed, in
the wake of the rebellion.'You know,' wrote an inhabitant of St
Benoit to a friend in Montreal, 'where the younger Arnoldi got his
supply of butter, or where another got the guitar he carried back with
him from the expedition about the neck.'And it is probable that the
British officers, and perhaps Sir John Colborne himself, winked at some
things which they could not officially recognize.At any rate, it is
impossible to acquit Colborne of all responsibility for the unsoldierly
conduct of the men under his command.It is usual to regard the rebellion of 1837 in Lower Canada as no less
a fiasco than its counterpart in Upper Canada.There is no doubt that
it was hopeless from the outset.{102} It was an impromptu movement,
based upon a sudden resolution rather than on a well-reasoned plan of
action.Most of the leaders--Wolfred Nelson, Thomas Storrow Brown,
Robert Bouchette, and Amury Girod--were strangers to the men under
their command; and none of them, save Chenier, seemed disposed to fight
to the last ditch.The movement at its inception fell under the
official ban of the Church; and only two priests, the cures of St
Charles and St Benoit, showed it any encouragement.The actual
rebellion was confined to the county of Two Mountains and the valley of
the Richelieu.The districts of Quebec and Three Rivers were quiet as
the grave--with the exception, perhaps, of an occasional village like
Montmagny, where Etienne P. Tache, afterwards a colleague of Sir John
Macdonald and prime minister of Canada, was the centre of a local
agitation.Yet it is easy to see that the rebellion might have been
much more serious.But for the loyal attitude of the ecclesiastical
authorities, and the efforts of many clear-headed parish priests like
the Abbe Paquin of St Eustache, the revolutionary leaders might have
been able to consummate their plans, and Sir John Colborne, with the
small number of troops at {103} his disposal, might have found it
difficult to keep the flag flying.The rebellion was easily snuffed
out because the majority of the French-Canadian people, in obedience to
the voice of their Church, set their faces against it.{104}

CHAPTER X

THE LORD HIGH COMMISSIONER

The rebellions in Upper and Lower Canada profoundly affected public
opinion in the mother country.That the first year of the reign of the
young Queen Victoria should have been marred by an armed revolt in an
important British colony shocked the sensibilities of Englishmen and
forced the country and the government to realize that the grievances of
the Canadian Reformers were more serious than they had imagined.It
was clear that the old system of alternating concession and repression
had broken down and that the situation demanded radical action.The
Melbourne government suspended the constitution of Lower Canada for
three years, and appointed the Earl of Durham as Lord High
Commissioner, with very full powers, to go out to Canada to investigate
the grievances and to report on a remedy.John George Lambton, the first Earl of {105} Durham, was a wealthy and
powerful Whig nobleman, of decided Liberal, if not Radical, leanings.He had taken no small part in the framing of the Reform Bill of 1832,
and at one time he had been hailed by the English Radicals or Chartists
as their coming leader.It was therefore expected that he would be
decently sympathetic with the Reform movements in the Canadas.At the
same time, Melbourne and his ministers were only too glad to ship him
out of the country.There was no question of his great ability and
statesmanlike outlook.But his advanced Radical views were distasteful
to many of his former colleagues; and his arrogant manners, his lack of
tact, and his love of pomp and circumstance made him unpopular even in
his own party.The truth is that he was an excellent leader to work
under, but a bad colleague to work with.The Melbourne government had
first got rid of him by sending him to St Petersburg as ambassador
extraordinary; and then, on his return from St Petersburg, they got him
out of the way by sending him to Canada.He was at first loath to go,
mainly on the ground of ill health; but at the personal intercession of
the young queen he accepted the commission offered him.It was {106}
an evil day for himself, but a good day for Canada, when he did so.Durham arrived in Quebec, with an almost regal retinue, on May 28,
1838.Gosford, who had remained in Canada throughout the rebellion,
had gone home at the end of February; and the administration had been
taken over by Sir John Colborne, the commander-in-chief of the forces.As soon as the news of the suspension of the constitution reached Lower
Canada, Sir John Colborne appointed a provisional special council of
twenty-two members, half of them French and half of them English, to
administer the affairs of the province until Lord Durham should arrive.The first official act of Lord Durham in the colony swept this council
out of existence.'His Excellency believes,' the members of the
council were told, 'that it is as much the interest of you all, as for
the advantage of his own mission, that his administrative conduct
should be free from all suspicions of political influence or party
feeling; that it should rest on his own undivided responsibility, and
that when he quits the Province, he should leave none of its permanent
residents in any way committed by the acts which his Government may
have {107} found it necessary to perform, during the temporary
suspension of the Constitution.'In its place he appointed a small
council of five members, all but one from his own staff.The one
Canadian called to this council was Dominick Daly, the provincial
secretary, whom Colborne recommended as being unidentified with any
political party.The first great problem with which Lord Durham and his council had to
deal was the question of the political prisoners, numbers of whom were
still lying in the prisons of Montreal.Sir John Colborne had not
attempted to decide what should be done with them, preferring to shift
this responsibility upon Lord Durham.It would probably have been much
better to have settled the matter before Lord Durham set foot in the
colony, so that his mission might not have been handicapped at the
outset with so thorny a problem; but it is easy to follow Colborne's
reasoning.In the first place, he did not bring the prisoners to trial
because no Lower-Canadian jury at that time could have been induced to
convict them, a reasonable inference from the fact that the murder of
Weir had gone unavenged, even as the murderers of Chartrand were to be
acquitted {108} by a jury a few months later.In the second place,
Colborne had not the power to deal with the prisoners summarily.Moreover, most of the rebel leaders had not been captured.The only
three prisoners of much importance were Wolfred Nelson, Robert
Bouchette, and Bonaventure Viger.The rest of the _Patriote_ leaders
were scattered far and wide.Chenier and Girod lay beneath the
springing sod; Papineau, O'Callaghan, Storrow Brown, Robert Nelson,
Cote, and Rodier were across the American border; Morin had just come
out of his hiding-place in the Canadian backwoods; and LaFontaine,
after vainly endeavouring, on the outbreak of rebellion, to get Gosford
to call together the legislature of Lower Canada, had gone abroad.The
future course of the rebels who had fled to the United States was still
doubtful; there was a strong probability that they might create further
disturbances.And, while the situation was still unsettled, Colborne
thought it better to leave the fate of the prisoners to be decided by
Durham.Durham's instructions were to temper justice with mercy.His own
instincts were apparently in favour of a complete amnesty; but he
supposed it necessary to make an {109} example of some of the leaders.After earnest deliberation and consultation with his council, and
especially with his chief secretary, Charles Buller, the friend and
pupil of Thomas Carlyle, Durham determined to grant to the rebels a
general amnesty, with only twenty-four exceptions.Eight of the men
excepted were political prisoners who had been prominent in the revolt
and who had confessed their guilt and had thrown themselves on the
mercy of the Lord High Commissioner; the remaining sixteen were rebel
leaders who had fled from the country.Durham gave orders that the
eight prisoners should be transported to the Bermudas during the
queen's pleasure.The sixteen refugees were forbidden to return to
Canada under penalty of death without benefit of clergy.No one can fail to see that this course was dictated by the humanest
considerations.A criminal rebellion had terminated without the
shedding judicially of a drop of blood.Lord Durham even took care
that the eight prisoners should not be sent to a convict colony.The
only criticism directed against his course in Canada was on the ground
of its excessive lenity.Wolfred Nelson and Robert Bouchette had
certainly suffered a milder fate {110} than that of Samuel Lount and
Peter Matthews, who had been hanged in Upper Canada for rebellion.Yet
when the news of Durham's action reached England, it was immediately
attacked as arbitrary and unconstitutional.The assault was opened by
Lord Brougham, a bitter personal enemy of Lord Durham.In the House of
Lords Brougham contended that Durham had had no right to pass sentence
on the rebel prisoners and refugees when they had not been brought to
trial; and that he had no right to order them to be transported to, and
held in, Bermuda, where his authority did not run.In this attitude he
was supported by the Duke of Wellington, the leader of the Tory party.Wellington's name is one which is usually remembered with honour in the
history of the British Empire; but on this occasion he did not think it
beneath him to play fast and loose with the interests of Canada for the
sake of a paltry party advantage.It would have been easy for him to
recognize the humanity of Durham's policy, and to join with the
government in legislating away any technical illegalities that may have
existed in Durham's ordinance; but Wellington could not resist the
temptation to embarrass the Whig {111} administration, regardless of
the injury which he might be doing to the sorely tried people of Canada.The Melbourne administration, which had sent Durham to Canada, might
have been expected to stand behind him when he was attacked.Lord John
Russell, indeed, rose in the House of Commons and made a thoroughgoing
defence of Durham's policy as 'wise and statesmanlike.'But he alone
of the ministers gave Durham loyal support.In the House of Lords
Melbourne contented himself with a feeble defence of Durham and then
capitulated to the Opposition.Nothing would have been easier for him
than to introduce a bill making valid whatever may have been irregular
in Durham's ordinance; but instead of that he disallowed the ordinance,
and passed an Act of Indemnity for all those who had had a part in
carrying it out.Without waiting to hear Durham's defence, or to
consult with him as to the course which should be followed, the Cabinet
weakly surrendered to an attack of his personal enemies.Durham was
betrayed in the house of his friends.The news of the disallowance of the ordinance first reached Durham
through the columns of an American newspaper.{112} Immediately his
mind was made up.Without waiting for any official notification, he
sent in his resignation to the colonial secretary.He was quite
satisfied himself that he had not exceeded his powers.'Until I
learn,' he wrote, 'from some one better versed in the English language
that despotism means anything but such an aggregation of the supreme
executive and legislative authority in a single head, as was
deliberately made by Parliament in the Act which constituted my powers,
I shall not blush to hear that I have exercised a despotism; I shall
feel anxious only to know how well and wisely I have used, or rather
exhibited an intention of using, my great powers.'But he felt that if
he could expect no firm support from the Melbourne government, his
usefulness was gone, and resignation was the only course open to him.He wrote, however, that he intended to remain in Canada until he had
completed the inquiries he had instituted.In view of the 'lamentable
want of information' with regard to Canada which existed in the
Imperial parliament, he confessed that he 'would take shame to himself
if he left his inquiry incomplete.'A few days before Durham left Canada he took the unusual and, under
ordinary {113} circumstances, unconstitutional course of issuing a
proclamation, in which he explained the reasons for his resignation,
and in effect appealed from the action of the home government to
Canadian public opinion.It was this proclamation which drew down on
him from _The Times_ the nickname of 'Lord High Seditioner.'The
wisdom of the proclamation was afterwards, however, vigorously defended
by Charles Duller.The general unpopularity of the British government,
Duller explained, was such in Canada that a little more or less could
not affect it; whereas it was a matter of vital importance that the
angry and suspicious colonists should find one British statesman with
whom they could agree.The real justification of the proclamation lay
in the magical effect which it had upon the public temper.The news
that the ordinance had been disallowed, and that the whole question of
the political prisoners had been once more thrown into the melting-pot,
had greatly excited the public mind; and the proclamation fell like oil
upon the troubled waters.'No disorder, no increase of disaffection
ensued; on the contrary, all parties in the Province expressed a
revival of confidence.'Lord Durham left Quebec on November 1, {114} 1838.'It was a sad day
and a sad departure,' wrote Buller.The
spectators filled every window and every house-top, and, though every
hat was raised as we passed, a deep silence marked the general grief
for Lord Durham's departure.'Durham had been in Canada only five
short months.Yet in that time he had gained a knowledge of, and an
insight into, the Canadian situation such as no other governor of
Canada had possessed.The permanent monument of that insight is, of
course, his famous _Report on the Affairs of British North America_,
issued by the Colonial Office in 1839.This is no place to write at
length about that greatest of all documents ever published with regard
to colonial affairs.In the _Report_
Lord Durham rightly diagnosed the evils of the body politic in Canada.He traced the rebellion to two causes, in the main: first, racial
feeling; and, secondly, that 'union of representative and irresponsible
government' of which he said that it was difficult to understand how
any English statesman ever imagined that such a system would work.And
yet one of the two chief remedies which he recommended seemed like a
death sentence passed on the French in Canada.{115} This was the
proposal for the legislative union of Upper and Lower Canada with the
avowed object of anglicizing by absorption the French population.This
suggestion certainly did not promote racial peace.The other proposal,
that of granting to the Canadian people responsible government in all
matters not infringing'strictly imperial interests,' blazed the trail
leading out of the swamps of pre-rebellion politics.In one respect only is Lord Durham's _Report_ seriously faulty: it is
not fair to French Canadians.'They cling,' wrote Durham, 'to ancient
prejudices, ancient customs, and ancient laws, not from any strong
sense of their beneficial effects, but with the unreasoning tenacity of
an uneducated and unprogressive people.'To their racial and
nationalist ambitions he was far from favourable.'The error,' he
contended, 'to which the present contest is to be attributed is the
vain endeavour to preserve a French-Canadian nationality in the midst
of Anglo-American colonies and states'; and he quoted with seeming
approval the statement of one of the Lower Canada 'Bureaucrats' that
'Lower Canada must be _English_, at the expense, if necessary, of not
being _British_.'His primary {116} object in recommending the union
of the two Canadas, to place the French in a minority in the united
province, was surely a mistaken policy.Lord Elgin, a far wiser statesman, who completed Durham's
work by introducing the substance of responsible government which the
_Report_ recommended, decidedly opposed anything in the nature of a
gradual crusade against French-Canadian nationalism.'I for one,' he
wrote, 'am deeply convinced of the impolicy of all such attempts to
denationalize the French.Generally speaking, they produce the
opposite effect, causing the flame of national prejudice and animosity
to burn more fiercely.But suppose them to be successful, what would
be the result?You may perhaps _Americanize_, but, depend upon it, by
methods of this description you will never _Anglicize_ the French
inhabitants of the province.Let them feel, on the other hand, that
their religion, their habits, their prepossessions, their prejudices if
you will, are more considered and respected here than in other portions
of this vast continent, and who will venture to say that the last hand
which waves the British flag on American ground may not be that of a
French Canadian?'{117}

CHAPTER XI

THE SECOND REBELLION

The frigate _Inconstant_, with Lord Durham on board, was not two days
out from Quebec when rebellion broke out anew in Lower Canada.This
second rebellion, however, was not caused by Lord Durham's departure,
but was the result of a long course of agitation which had been carried
on along the American border throughout the months of Lord Durham's
regime.As early as February 1838 numbers of Canadian refugees had gathered in
the towns on the American side of the boundary-line in the
neighbourhood of Lake Champlain.They were shown much sympathy and
encouragement by the Americans, and seem to have laboured under the
delusion that the American government would come to their assistance.A proclamation signed by Robert Nelson, a brother of Wolfred Nelson,
declared the independence of Canada under a {118} 'provisional
government' of which Robert Nelson was president and Dr Cote a member.The identity of the other members is a mystery.Papineau seems to have
had some dealings with Nelson and Cote, and to have dallied with the
idea of throwing in his lot with them; but he soon broke off
negotiations.'Papineau,' wrote Robert Nelson, 'has abandoned us, and
this through selfish and family motives regarding the seigniories, and
inveterate love of the old French bad laws.'There is reason to
believe, however, that Papineau had been in communication with the
authorities at Washington, and that his desertion of Robert Nelson and
Cote was in reality due to his discovery that President Van Buren was
not ready to depart from his attitude of neutrality.On February 28, 1838, Robert Nelson and Cote had crossed the border
with an armed force of French-Canadian refugees and three small
field-pieces.Their plan had contemplated the capture of Montreal and
a junction with another invading force at Three Rivers.But on finding
their way barred by the Missisquoi militia, they had beat a hasty
retreat to the border, without fighting; and had there been disarmed by
the American {119} troops under General Wool, a brave and able officer
who had fought with conspicuous gallantry at the battle of Queenston
Heights in 1812.During the summer months, however, the refugees had continued to lay
plans for an insurrection in Lower Canada.Emissaries had been
constantly moving among the parishes north of the New York and Vermont
frontiers, promising the _Patriotes_ arms and supplies and men from the
United States.And when November
came large bodies of disaffected habitants gathered at St Ours, St
Charles, St Michel, L'Acadie, Chateauguay, and Beauharnois.They had
apparently been led to expect that they would be met at some of these
places by American sympathizers with arms and supplies.No such aid
being found at the rendezvous, many returned to their homes.But some
persevered in the movement, and made their way with packs on their
backs to Napierville, a town fifteen miles north of the boundary-line,
which had been designated as the rebel headquarters.Meanwhile, Robert Nelson had moved northward to Napierville from the
American side of the border with a small band of refugees.{120} Among
these were two French officers, named Hindenlang and Touvrey, who had
been inveigled into joining the expedition.Hindenlang, who afterwards
paid for his folly with his life, has left an interesting account of
what happened.He and Touvrey joined Nelson at St Albans, on the west
side of Lake Champlain.With two hundred and fifty muskets, which had
been placed in a boat by an American sympathizer, they dropped down the
river to the Canadian border.There were five in the party--Nelson and
the two French officers, the guide, and the boatman.Nelson had given
Hindenlang to understand that the habitants had risen and that he would
be greeted at the Canadian border by a large force of enthusiastic
recruits.'There was not a
single man to receive the famous President of the _Provisional
Government_; and it was only after a full hour's search, and much
trouble, [that] the guide returned with five or six men to land the
arms.'On the morning of November 4 the party arrived at Napierville.Here Hindenlang found Dr Cote already at the head of two or three
hundred men.A crowd speedily gathered, and Robert Nelson was
proclaimed 'President of the Republic of {121} Lower Canada.'Hindenlang and Touvrey were presented to the crowd; and to his great
astonishment Hindenlang was informed that his rank in the rebel force
was that of brigadier-general.The first two or three days were spent in hastening the arrival of
reinforcements and in gathering arms.By the 7th Nelson had collected
a force of about twenty-five hundred men, whom Hindenlang told off in
companies and divisions.Most of the rebels were armed with pitchforks
and pikes.An attempt had been made two days earlier, on a Sunday, to
obtain arms, ammunition, and stores from the houses of the Indians of
Caughnawaga while they were at church; but a squaw in search of her cow
had discovered the raiders and had given the alarm, with the result
that the Indians, seizing muskets and tomahawks, had repelled the
attack and taken seventy prisoners.On November 5 Nelson sent Cote with a force of four or five hundred men
south to Rouse's Point, on the boundary-line, to secure more arms and
ammunition from the American sympathizers.On his way south Cote
encountered a picket of a company of loyalist volunteers stationed at
Lacolle, and drove it {122} in.On his return journey, however, he met
with greater opposition.The company at Lacolle had been reinforced in
the meantime by several companies of loyalist militia from Hemmingford.As the rebels appeared the loyalist militia attacked them; and after a
brisk skirmish, which lasted from twenty to twenty-five minutes, drove
them from the field.Without further ado the rebels fled across the
border, leaving behind them eleven dead and a number of prisoners, as
well as a six-pounder gun, a large number of muskets of the type used
in the United States army, a keg of powder, a quantity of
ball-cartridge, and a great many pikes.Of the provincial troops two
were killed and one was severely wounded.The defeat of Cote and his men at Lacolle meant that Nelson's line of
communications with his base on the American frontier was cut.At the
same time he received word that Sir John Colborne was advancing on
Napierville from Laprairie with a strong force of regulars and
volunteers.Under these circumstances he determined to fall back on
Odelltown, just north of the border.He had with him about a thousand
men, eight hundred of whom were armed with muskets.{123} He arrived
at Odelltown on the morning of November 9, to find it occupied by about
two hundred loyal militia, under the command of the inspecting
field-officer of the district, Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor.He had no
difficulty in driving in the loyalist outposts; but the village itself
proved a harder nut to crack.Taylor had concentrated his little force
at the Methodist church, and he controlled the road leading to it by
means of the six-pounder which had been taken from the rebels three
days before at Lacolle.The insurgents extended through the fields to
the right and left, and opened a vigorous fire on the church from
behind some barns; but many of the men seem to have kept out of range.'The greater part of the Canadians kept out of shot,' wrote Hindenlang;
'threw themselves on their knees, with their faces buried in the snow,
praying to God, and remaining as motionless as if they were so many
saints, hewn in stone.Many remained in that posture as long as the
fighting lasted.'The truth appears to be that many of Nelson's men
had been intimidated into joining the rebel force.The engagement
lasted in all about two hours and a half.The defenders of the church
made several successful sallies; and just when the {124} rebels were
beginning to lose heart, a company of loyalists from across the
Richelieu fell on their flank and completed their discomfiture.The
rebels then retreated to Napierville, under the command of Hindenlang.Robert Nelson, seeing that the day was lost, left his men in the lurch
and rode for the American border.The losses of the rebels were
serious; they left fifty dead on the field and carried off as many
wounded.Of the loyalists, one officer and five men were killed and
one officer and eight men wounded.Later in the same day Sir John Colborne, at the head of a formidable
force, entered Napierville.On his approach those rebels who were
still in the village dispersed and fled to their homes.Detachments of
troops were immediately sent out to disperse bands of rebels reported
to be still under arms.The only encounter took place at Beauharnois,
where a large body of insurgents had assembled.After a slight
resistance they were driven out by two battalions of Glengarry
volunteers, supported by two companies of the 71st and a detachment of
Royal Engineers.In these expeditions the British soldiers, especially the volunteers,
did a good deal of burning and harrying.After the victory at {125}
Beauharnois they gave to the flames a large part of the village,
including the houses of some loyal citizens.In view of the
intimidation and depredations to which the loyalists had been subjected
by the rebels in the disaffected districts, the conduct of the men, in
these regrettable acts, may be understood and partially excused.But
no excuse can be offered for the attitude of the British authorities.There are well-authenticated cases of houses of 'notorious rebels'
burned down by the orders of Sir James Macdonell, Colborne's
second-in-command.Colborne himself acquired the nickname of 'the old
Firebrand'; and, while he cannot be charged with such a mania for
incendiarism as some writers have imputed to him, it does not appear
that he took any effective measures to stop the arson or to punish the
offenders.The rebellion of 1838 lasted scarcely a week.Failing important aid from the United States, the
rebels had an even slighter chance of success than they had had a year
before, for since that time the British regular troops in Canada had
been considerably increased in number.The chief responsibility for
the rebellion must be placed at the door of Robert Nelson, who at {126}
the critical moment fled over the border, leaving his dupes to
extricate themselves as best they could from the situation into which
he had led them.As was the case in 1837, most of the leaders of the
rebellion escaped from justice, leaving only the smaller fry in the
hands of the authorities.Of the lesser ringleaders nearly one hundred
were brought to trial.Two of the French-Canadian judges, one of them
being Elzear Bedard, attempted to force the government to try the
prisoners in the civil courts, where they would have the benefit of
trial by jury; but Sir John Colborne suspended these judges from their
functions, and brought the prisoners before a court-martial, specially
convened for the purpose.Twelve of them, including the French officer
Hindenlang, were condemned to death and duly executed.Most of the
others were transported to the convict settlements of Australia.It is
worthy of remark that none of those executed or deported had been
persons of note in the political arena before 1837.On the whole, it
must be confessed that these sentences showed a commendable moderation.It was thought necessary that a few examples should be made, as Lord
Durham's amnesty of the previous year had evidently encouraged some
{127} habitants to believe that rebellion was a venial offence.And
the execution of twelve men, out of the thousands who had taken part in
the revolt, cannot be said to have shown a bloodthirsty disposition on
the part of the government.{128}

CHAPTER XII

A POSTSCRIPT

The rebellion of 1837 now belongs to the dead past.The _Patriotes_
and the 'Bureaucrats' of those days have passed away; and the present
generation has forgotten, or should have forgotten, the passions which
inspired them.The time has come when Canadians should take an
impartial view of the events of that time, and should be willing to
recognize the good and the bad on either side.It is absurd to pretend
that many of the English in Lower Canada were not arrogant and brutal
in their attitude toward the French Canadians, and lawless in their
methods of crushing the rebellion; or that many of the _Patriote_
leaders were not hopelessly irreconcilable before the rebellion, and
during it criminally careless of the interests of the poor habitants
they had misled.On the other hand, no true Canadian can fail to be
proud of the spirit of loyalty which in 1837 {129} actuated not only
persons of British birth, but many faithful sons and daughters of the
French-Canadian Church.Nor can one fail to admire the devotion to
liberty, to 'the rights of the people,' which characterized rebels like
Robert Bouchette.'When I speak of the rights of the people,' wrote
Bouchette, 'I do not mean those abstract or extravagant rights for
which some contend, but which are not generally compatible with an
organized state of society, but I mean those cardinal rights which are
inherent to British subjects, and which, as such, ought not to be
denied to the inhabitants of any section of the empire, however
remote.'The people of Canada to-day are able to combine loyalty and
liberty as the men of that day were not; and they should never forget
that in some measure they owe to the one party the continuance of
Canada in the Empire, and to the other party the freedom wherewith they
have been made free.From a print in M'Gill University
Library.]The later history of the _Patriotes_ falls outside the scope of this
little book, but a few lines may be added to trace their varying
fortunes.Robert Nelson took
up his abode in New York, and there practised surgery until {130} his
death in 1873.E. B. O'Callaghan went to Albany, and was there
employed by the legislature of New York in preparing two series of
volumes entitled _A Documentary History of New York_ and _Documents
relating to the Colonial History of the State of New York_, volumes
which are edited in so scholarly a manner, and throw such light on
Canadian history, that the Canadian historian would fain forgive him
for his part in the unhappy rebellion of '37.Most of the _Patriote_ leaders took advantage, however, of the virtual
amnesty offered them in 1842 by the first LaFontaine-Baldwin
administration, and returned to Canada.Many of these, as well as many
of the _Patriote_ leaders who had not been implicated in the rebellion
and who had not fled the country, rose to positions of trust and
prominence in the public service of Canada.Louis Hippolyte
LaFontaine, after having gone abroad during the winter of 1837-38, and
after having been arrested on suspicion in November 1838, entered the
parliament of Canada, formed, with Robert Baldwin as his colleague, the
administration which ushered in full responsible government, and was
knighted by Queen Victoria.Augustin Morin, the reputed author {131}
of the Ninety-Two Resolutions, who had spent the winter of 1837-38 in
hiding, became the colleague of Francis Hincks in the Hincks-Morin
administration.George Etienne Cartier, who had shouldered a musket at
St Denis, became the lifelong colleague of Sir John Macdonald and was
made a baronet by his sovereign.Dr Wolfred Nelson returned to his
practice in Montreal in 1842.In 1844 he was elected member of
parliament for the county of Richelieu.In 1851 he was appointed an
inspector of prisons.Thomas Storrow Brown, on his return to Montreal,
took up again his business in hardware, and is remembered to-day by
Canadian numismatists as having been one of the first to issue a
halfpenny token, which bore his name and is still sought by collectors.Robert Bouchette recovered from the serious wound he had sustained at
Moore's Corners, and later became Her Majesty's commissioner of customs
at Ottawa.Papineau returned to Canada in 1845.The greater part of his period of
exile he spent in Paris, where he came in touch with the'red
republicans' who later supported the revolution of 1848.He entered
the Canadian parliament in 1847 and sat in it until 1854.{132} But he
proved to be completely out of harmony with the new order of things
under responsible government.Even with his old lieutenant LaFontaine,
who had made possible his return to Canada, he had an open breach.The
truth is that Papineau was born to live in opposition.That he himself
realized this is clear from a laughing remark which he made when
explaining his late arrival at a meeting: 'I waited to take an
opposition boat.'His real importance after his return to Canada lay
not in the parliamentary sphere, but in the encouragement which he gave
to those radical and anti-clerical ideas that found expression in the
foundation of the _Institut Canadien_ and the formation of the _Parti
Rouge_.In many respects the _Parti Rouge_ was the continuation of the
_Patriote_ party of 1837.Papineau's later days were quiet and
dignified.He retired to his seigneury of La Petite Nation at
Montebello and devoted himself to his books.With many of his old
antagonists he effected a pleasant reconciliation.Only on rare
occasions did he break his silence; but on one of these, when he came
to Montreal, an old silver-haired man of eighty-one years, to deliver
an address before the _Institut Canadien_, he uttered a sentence which
may be taken as {133} the _apologia pro vita sua_: 'You will believe
me, I trust, when I say to you, I love my country....  Opinions outside
may differ; but looking into my heart and my mind in all sincerity, I
feel I can say that I have loved her as she should be loved.'And
charity covereth a multitude of sins.{134}

BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE

The story of the Lower Canada rebellion is told in detail in some of
the general histories of Canada.William Kingsford, _History of
Canada_ (1887-94), is somewhat inaccurate and shows a strong bias
against the _Patriotes_, but his narrative of the rebellion is full and
interesting.F. X. Garneau, _Histoire du Canada_ (1845-52), presents
the history of the period, from the French-Canadian point of view, with
sympathy and power.A work which holds the scales very evenly is
Robert Christie, _A History of the Late Province of Lower Canada_
(1848-55).Christie played a not inconspicuous part in the
pre-rebellion politics, and his volumes contain a great deal of
original material of first-rate importance.Of special studies of the rebellion there are a number worthy of
mention.L. O. David, _Les Patriotes de 1837-38_, is valuable for its
complete biographies of the leaders in the movement.L. N. Carrier,
_Les Evenements de 1837-38_ (1877), is a sketch of the rebellion
written by the son of one of the _Patriotes_.Globensky, _La Rebellion
de 1837 a Saint-Eustache_ (1883), written by the son of an officer in
the loyalist militia, contains some original materials of value.Lord
Charles Beauclerk, _Lithographic Views of Military Operations in Canada
under Sir John Colborne, O.C.B., {135} etc._ (1840), apart from the
value of the illustrations, is interesting on account of the
introduction, in which the author, a British army officer who served in
Canada throughout the rebellion, describes the course of the military
operations.The political aspect of the rebellion, from the Tory point
of view, is dealt with in T. C. Haliburton, _The Bubbles of Canada_
(1839).For a penetrating analysis of the situation which led to the
rebellion see Lord Durham's _Report on the Affairs of British North
America_.A few biographies may be consulted with advantage.N. E. Dionne,
_Pierre Bedard et ses fils_ (1909), throws light on the earlier period;
as does also Ernest Cruikshank, _The Administration of Sir James Craig_
(_Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada_, 3rd series, vol.See also A. D. DeCelles, _Papineau_ (1904), in the 'Makers of Canada'
series; and Stuart J. Reid, _Life and Letters of the First Earl of
Durham_ (1906).The parish histories, in which the province of Quebec abounds, will be
found to yield much information of a local nature with regard to the
rebellion; and the same may be said of the publications of local
historical societies, such as that of Missisquoi county.An original document of primary importance is the _Report of the state
trials before a general court-martial held at Montreal in 1838-39;
exhibiting a complete history of the late rebellion in Lower Canada_
(1839).{136}

"I'll take thee by thine ear and toss thee to the moon," he cried,
reaching out his hand to make good his word."Nonsense, Anklehigh," returned Bludgeonhead, calmly.No dwarf can fight with a giant of my size.""But I am not the dwarf Anklehigh," shrieked Fortyforefoot."And I am Bludgeonhead," returned the other, rising and towering way
above the owner of the valley.cried Fortyforefoot, falling on his knees in abject
terror.Pardon, O, Bludgeonhead.I did not know
you when I was so hasty as to offer to throw you to the moon.I thought
you were--er--that you were--er----"

"More easily thrown," suggested Bludgeonhead."Yes--yes--that was it," stammered Fortyforefoot."And now, to show that
you have forgiven me, I want you to come to my castle and have dinner
with me.""I'll be very glad to," replied Bludgeonhead."What are you going to
have for dinner?""Anything you wish," said Fortyforefoot."I was going to have a very
plain dinner to-night because for to-morrow's dinner I have invited my
brother Fortythreefoot and his wife Fortytwoinch to have a little
special dish I have been so fortunate as to secure.""Oh, only a sniveling creature I caught in one of my traps this
afternoon.He was a soldier, and he wasn't very brave about being
caught, but I judge from looking at him that he will make good eating,"
said Fortyforefoot."I couldn't gather from him who he was.He had on a
military uniform, but he behaved less like a warrior than ever I
supposed a man could.It seems from his story that he was engaged upon
some secret mission, and on his way back to his army, he stumbled over
and into one of my game traps where I found him.He begged me to let him
go, but that was out of the question.I haven't had a soldier to eat for
four years, so I took him to the castle, had him locked up in the
ice-box, and to-morrow we shall eat him."asked Bludgeonhead, thoughtfully.He told me so many names that I didn't
believe he really owned any of them," said Fortyforefoot."All I could
really learn about him was that he was as brave as a lion, and that if I
would spare him he would write me a poem a mile long every day of my
life.""Very attractive offer, that," said Bludgeonhead, with a smile."Yes; but I couldn't do it.I wouldn't miss eating him for anything,"
replied Fortyforefoot, smacking his lips, hungrily."I'd give anything
anybody'd ask, too, if I could find another as good.""Well, now, I thought you
would, and that is really what I have come here for.I have in my pocket
here a real live general that I have captured.Now between you and me, I
don't eat generals.I don't care for them--they fight so.I prefer
preserved cherries and pickled peaches and--er--strawberry jam and
powdered sugar and almonds, and other things like that, you know, and it
occurred to me that if I let you have the general you would supply me
with what I needed of the others.""You have come to the right place, Bludgeonhead," said Fortyforefoot,
eagerly."I'll give you a million cans of jam, all the pickled peaches
and other things you can carry if this general you speak about is a fine
specimen.""Well, here he is," said Bludgeonhead, hauling Jimmieboy out of his
pocket--whispering to Jimmieboy at the same time not to be afraid
because he wouldn't let anything happen to him, and so of course
Jimmieboy felt perfectly safe, though a little excited."No," answered Bludgeonhead, putting Jimmieboy back into his pocket
again."If I ever do find another, though, you shall have him."This of course put Fortyforefoot in a tremendously good humor, and
before an hour had passed he had not only transformed pebbles and twigs
and leaves of trees and other small things into the provisions that the
tin soldiers needed, but he had also furnished horses and wagons enough
to carry them back to headquarters, and then Fortyforefoot accompanied
by Bludgeonhead entered the castle, where the proprietor demanded that
Jimmieboy should be given up to him.Bludgeonhead handed him over at once, and ten minutes later Jimmieboy
found himself locked up in the pantry.Hardly had he time to think over the strange events of the afternoon
when he heard a noise in the ice-box over in one corner of the pantry,
and on going there to see what was the cause of it he heard a familiar
voice repeating over and over again these mournful lines:

    "From Giant number one I ran--
       But O the sequel dire!I truly left a frying-pan
       And jumped into a fire.""Hullo in there," whispered Jimmieboy."The bravest man of my time," replied the voice in the ice-box."Major
Mortimer Carraway Blueface of the 'Jimmieboy Guards.'""Oh, I am so glad to find you again," cried Jimmieboy, throwing open the
ice-box door."I thought it was you the minute I heard your poetry.""You recognized the beauty of
the poem?""But you said you were in the fire when I
knew you were in the ice-box, and so of course----"

"Of course," said the major, with a frown."You remembered that when I
say one thing I mean another.Well, I'm glad to see you again, but why
did you desert me so cruelly?"For a moment Jimmieboy could say nothing, so surprised was he at the
major's question.Then he simply repeated it, his amazement very evident
in the tone of his voice."Why did we desert you so cruelly?"When two of my companions
in arms leave me, the way you and old Spriteyboy did, I think you ought
to make some explanation."But we didn't desert you," said Jimmieboy."No such idea ever entered
our minds.The minute Spritey turned into
Bludgeonhead you ran away just about as fast as your tin legs could
carry you--frightened to death evidently.""Jimmieboy," said the major, his voice husky with emotion, "any other
person than yourself would have had to fight a duel with me for casting
such a doubt as you have just cast upon my courage.The idea of me, of
I, of myself, Major Mortimer Carraway Blueface, the hero of a hundred
and eighty-seven real sham fights, the most poetic as well as the
handsomest man in the 'Jimmieboy Guards' being accused of running away!"I've been accused of dreadful things,
     Of wearing copper finger-rings,
     Of eating green peas with a spoon,
     Of wishing that I owned the moon,
     Of telling things that weren't the truth,
     Of having cut no wisdom tooth,
     In times of war of stealing buns,
     And fainting at the sound of guns,
     Yet never dreamed I'd see the day
     When it was thought I'd run away.Alack--O--well-a-day--alas!Alas--O--well-a-day--alack!Alas--alack--O--well-a-day!Aday--alas--O--lack-a-well--"

"Are you going to keep that up forever?""If you are
I'm going to get out.I've heard stupid poetry in this campaign, but
that's the worst yet.""I only wanted to show you what I could do in the way of a lamentation,"
said the major."If you've had enough I'll stop of course; but tell me,"
he added, sitting down upon a cake of ice, and crossing his legs, "how
on earth did you ever get hold of the ridiculous notion that I ran away
frightened?"The minute
the sprite was changed into Bludgeonhead I turned to speak to you, and
all I could see of you was your coat-tails disappearing around the
corner way down the road.""And just because my coat-tails behaved like that you put me down as a
coward?"I hurried
off; but not because I was afraid.I was simply going down the road to
see if I couldn't find a looking-glass so that Spriteyboy could see how
he looked as a giant.""That's a magnificent excuse," he said."I thought you'd think it was," said the major, with a pleased smile."And when I finally found that there weren't any mirrors to be had
along the road I went back, and you two had gone and left me."It's a great thing, sleep is, and I wrote the
lines off in two tenths of a fifth of a second.As I remember it, this
is the way they went:

    "SLEEP.Deserted by my friends I sit,
       And silently I weep,
     Until I'm wearied so by it,
     I lose my little store of wit;
       I nod and fall asleep.Then in my dreams my friends I spy--
       Once more are they my own.I cease to murmur and to cry,
     For then 'tis sure to be that I
       Forget I am alone.'Tis hence I think that sleep's the best
       Of friends that man has got--
      Not only does it bring him rest
     But makes him feel that he is blest
       With blessings he has not.""Why didn't you go to sleep if you felt that way?""I wanted to find you and I hadn't time.There was only time for me to
scratch that poem off on my mind and start to find you and Bludgeyboy,"
replied the major."His name isn't Bludgeyboy," said Jimmieboy, with a smile."Oh, yes, I forgot," said the major."It's a good name, too,
Bludgeonpate is.""How did you come to be captured by Fortyforefoot?"asked Jimmieboy,
after he had decided not to try to correct the major any more as to
Bludgeonhead's name."The idea of a miserable
ogre like Fortyforefoot capturing me, the most sagacitacious soldier of
modern times.I suppose you think I fell into one of his game traps?"Sandra journeyed to the garden."That's what he said," said Jimmieboy."He said you acted in a very
curious way, too--promised him all sorts of things if he'd let you go.""That's just like those big, bragging giants," said the major.I came here of my own free will
and accord."Down here into this pantry and into the ice-chest?You can't fool me," said Jimmieboy."To meet you, of course," retorted the major.I knew it
was part of your scheme to come here.You and I were to be put into the
pantry and then old Bludgeyhat was to come and rescue us.I was the one
to make the scheme, wasn't I?"It was Bludgeonhead," said Jimmieboy, who didn't know whether to
believe the major or not."That's just the way," said the major, indignantly, "he gets all the
credit just because he's big and I don't get any, and yet if you knew of
all the wild animals I've killed to get here to you, how I met
Fortyforefoot and bound him hand and foot and refused to let him go
unless he would permit me to spend a week in his ice-chest, for the sole
and only purpose that I wished to meet you again, you'd change your mind
mighty quick about me.""Did you ever see me in a real sham battle?""No, I never did," said Jimmieboy."Well, you'd better never," returned the major, "unless you want to be
frightened out of your wits.I have been called the living telescope,
sir, because when I begin to fight, in the fiercest manner possible, I
sort of lengthen out and sprout up into the air until I am taller than
any foe within my reach."queried Jimmieboy, with a puzzled air about him."Well, I should like to see it once," said Jimmieboy."Then you will never believe it," returned the major, "because you will
never see it.I never fight in the presence of others, sir."As the major spoke these words a heavy footstep was heard on the stairs.cried the major, springing to his feet."I do not ask you for your gold,
       Nor for an old straw hat--
     I simply ask that I be told
       Oh what, oh what is that?""It is a footstep on the stairs," said Jimmieboy.moaned the major "If it is Fortyforefoot all is
over for us."I was afraid he could not wait,
       The miserable sinner,
     To serve me up in proper state
       At his to-morrow's dinner.Alas, he comes I greatly fear
       In search of Major Me, sir,
     And that he'll wash me down with beer
       This very night at tea, sir.""Oh, why did I come here--why----"

"I shall!"roared a voice out in the passage-way."You shall not," roared another voice, which Jimmieboy was delighted to
recognize as Bludgeonhead's."I am hungry," said the first voice, "and what is mine is my own to do
with as I please."I will toss you into the air, my dear Fortyforefoot," returned
Bludgeonhead's voice, "if you advance another step; and with such force,
sir, that you will never come down again."Stand aside," roared the voice of
Fortyforefoot.The two prisoners in the pantry heard a tremendous scuffling, a crash,
and a loud laugh.Then Bludgeonhead's voice was heard again."Good-by, Fortyforefoot," it cried."I hope he is not going to leave us," whispered Jimmieboy, but the major
was too frightened to speak, and he trembled so that half a dozen times
he fell off the ice-cake that he had been sitting on."Give my love to the moon when you pass her, and when you get up into
the milky way turn half a million of the stars there into baked apples
and throw 'em down to me," called Bludgeonhead's voice."If you'll only lasso me and pull me back I'll do anything you want me
to," came the voice of Fortyforefoot from some tremendous height, it
seemed to Jimmieboy."Not if I know it," replied Bludgeonhead, with a laugh."I think I'd
like to settle down here myself as the owner of Fortyforefoot Valley.Whatever answer was made to this it was too indistinct for Jimmieboy to
hear, and in a minute the key of the pantry door was turned, the door
thrown open, and Bludgeonhead stood before them."You are free," he said, grasping Jimmieboy's hand and squeezing it
affectionately."But I had to get rid of him.It was the only way to do
it."And did you really throw him off into the air?"asked Jimmieboy, as he
walked out into the hall.ejaculated Jimmieboy, as he glanced upward and saw a huge rent in
the ceiling, through which, gradually rising and getting smaller and
smaller the further he rose, was to be seen the unfortunate
Fortyforefoot."I simply picked him up and tossed him over
my head.I shall turn myself into Fortyforefoot
and settle down here forever, only instead of being a bad giant I shall
be a good one--but hallo!The major had crawled out of the ice-chest and was now trying to appear
calm, although his terrible fright still left him trembling so that he
could hardly speak."It is Major Blueface," said Jimmieboy, with a smile."He was Fortyforefoot's other prisoner.""N--nun--not at--t--at--at all," stammered the major."I
def--fuf--feated him in sus--single combat.""But what are you trembling so for now?""I--I am--m not tut--trembling," retorted the major."I--I am o--only
sh--shivering with--th--the--c--c--c--cold.I--I--I've bub--been in
th--that i--i--i--ice bu--box sus--so long."Jimmieboy and Bludgeonhead roared with laughter at this.Then giving the
major a warm coat to put on they sent him up stairs to lie down and
recover his nerves.After the major had been attended to, Bludgeonhead changed himself back
into the sprite again, and he and Jimmieboy sauntered in and out among
the gardens for an hour or more and were about returning to the castle
for supper when they heard sounds of music.There was evidently a brass
band coming up the road.In an instant they hid themselves behind a
tree, from which place of concealment they were delighted two or three
minutes later to perceive that the band was none other than that of the
"Jimmieboy Guards," and that behind it, in splendid military form,
appeared Colonel Zinc followed by the tin soldiers themselves.cried Jimmieboy, throwing his cap into the air.shrieked the colonel, waving his sword with delight, and
commanding his regiment to halt, as he caught sight of Jimmieboy.[Illustration: BLUDGEONHEAD COMES TO THE RESCUE.[Blank Page]

"Us likewise!"cheered the soldiers: following which came a trembling
voice from one of the castle windows which said:

    "I also wish to add my cheer
       Upon this happy day;
     And if you'll kindly come up here
       You'll hear me cry 'Hooray.'""No," said the sprite, motioning to Jimmieboy not to betray the major."Only a little worn-out by the fight we have had with Fortyforefoot.""Yes," said the sprite, modestly."We three have got rid of him at
last.""Do you know who
Fortyforefoot really was?"asked Jimmieboy, his curiosity aroused."The Parallelopipedon himself," said the colonel."We found that out
last night, and fearing that he might have captured our general and our
major we came here to besiege him in his castle and rescue our
officers.""But I don't see how Fortyforefoot could have been the
Parallelopipedon," said Jimmieboy."What would he want to be him for,
when, all he had to do to get anything he wanted was to take sand and
turn it into it?""Ah, but don't you see," explained the colonel, "there was one thing he
never could do as Fortyforefoot.The law prevented him from leaving this
valley here in any other form than that of the Parallelopipedon.He
didn't mind his confinement to the valley very much at first, but after
a while he began to feel cooped up here, and then he took an old packing
box and made it look as much like a living Parallelopipedon as he could.Then he got into it whenever he wanted to roam about the world.Probably
if you will search the castle you will find the cast-off shell he used
to wear, and if you do I hope you will destroy it, because it is said to
be a most horrible spectacle--frightening animals to death and causing
every flower within a mile to wither and shrink up at the mere sight of
it.""It's all true, Jimmieboy," said the sprite.Why,
he only gave us those cherries and peaches there in exchange for
yourself because he expected to get them all back again, you know.""It was a glorious victory," said the colonel."I will now announce it
to the soldiers."This he did and the soldiers were wild with joy when they heard the
news, and the band played a hymn of victory in which the soldiers
joined, singing so vigorously that they nearly cracked their voices.When they had quite finished the colonel said he guessed it was time to
return to the barracks in the nursery."Not before the feast," said the sprite."We have here all the
provisions the general set out to get, and before you return home,
colonel, you and your men should divide them among you."So the table was spread and all went happily.In the midst of the feast
the major appeared, determination written upon every line of his face.The soldiers cheered him loudly as he walked down the length of the
table, which he acknowledged as gracefully as he could with a stiff bow,
and then he spoke:

"Gentlemen," he said, "I have always been a good deal of a favorite with
you, and I know that what I am about to do will fill you with deep
grief.I am going to stop being a man of war.The tremendous victory we
have won to-day is the result entirely of the efforts of myself, General
Jimmieboy and Major Sprite--for to the latter I now give the title I
have borne so honorably for so many years.Our present victory is one of
such brilliantly brilliant brilliance that I feel that I may now retire
with lustre enough attached to my name to last for millions and millions
of years.I need rest, and here I shall take it, in this beautiful
valley, which by virtue of our victory belongs wholly and in equal parts
to General Jimmieboy, Major Sprite and myself.Hereafter I shall be
known only as Mortimer Carraway Blueface, Poet Laureate of Fortyforefoot
Hall, Fortyforefoot Valley, Pictureland.As Governor-General of the
country we have decided to appoint our illustrious friend, Major
Benjamin Bludgeonhead Sprite.General Jimmieboy will remain commander of
the forces, and the rest of you may divide amongst yourselves, as a
reward for your gallant services, all the provisions that may now be
left upon this table.That
is that you do not take the table.It is of solid mahogany and must be
worth a very considerable sum.Now let the saddest word be said,
    Now bend in sorrow deep the head.Let tears flow forth and drench the dell:
    Farewell, brave soldier boys, farewell."Here the major wiped his eyes sadly and sat down by the sprite who shook
his hand kindly and thanked him for giving him his title of major."We'll have fine times living here together," said the sprite."I'm going to see if I can't have
myself made over again, too, Spritey.I'll be pleasanter for you to look
at.What's the use of being a tin soldier in a place where even the
cobblestones are of gold and silver.""You can be plated any how," said Jimmieboy."Yes, and maybe I can have a platinum sword put in, and a real solid
gold head--but just at present that isn't what I want," said the major."What I am after now is a piece of birthday cake with real fruit raisins
in it and strips of citron two inches long, the whole concealed beneath
a one inch frosting."I don't think we have any here," said Jimmieboy, who was much pleased
to see the sprite and the major, both of whom he dearly loved, on such
good terms."But I'll run home and see if I can get some.""Well, we'll all go with you," said the colonel, starting up and
ordering the trumpeters to sound the call to arms."All except Blueface and myself," said the sprite."We will stay here
and put everything in readiness for your return.""That is a good idea," said Jimmieboy."And you'll have to hurry for we
shall be back very soon."This, as it turned out, was a very rash promise for Jimmieboy to make,
for after he and the tin soldiers had got the birthday cake and were
ready to enter Pictureland once more, they found that not one of them
could do it, the frame was so high up and the picture itself so hard
and impenetrable.Jimmieboy felt so badly to be unable to return to his
friends, that, following the major's hint about sleep bringing
forgetfulness of trouble, he threw himself down on the nursery couch,
and closing his brimming eyes dozed off into a dreamless sleep.It was quite dark when he opened them again and found himself still on
the couch with a piece of his papa's birthday cake in his hand, his
sorrows all gone and contentment in their place.His papa was sitting at
his side, and his mamma was standing over by the window smiling."You've had a good long nap, Jimmieboy," said she, "and I rather think,
from several things I've heard you say in your sleep, you've been
dreaming about your tin soldiers.""I don't believe it was a dream, mamma," he said, "it was all too real."And then he told his papa all that had happened."Well, it is very singular," said his papa, when Jimmieboy had finished,
"and if you want to believe it all happened you may; but you say all the
soldiers came back with you except Major Blueface?""Yes, every one," said Jimmieboy."Then we can tell whether it was true or not by looking in the tin
soldier's box.If the major isn't there he may be up in Fortyforefoot
castle as you say."Jimmieboy climbed eagerly down from the couch and rushing to the toy
closet got out the box of soldiers and searched it from top to bottom.The major was not to be seen anywhere, nor to this day has Jimmieboy
ever again set eyes upon him.Transcriber's Note:

The use of capitalisation for major and general has been retained as
appears in the original publication.Changes have been made as follows:

    ejaculated the Parallelopipedon?As the man saw that he was
observed by the commander, he quoted audibly to a comrade, from the
general order, "forage liberally on the country."But the general reproved
him and explained that foraging must be carried on only by regularly
designated parties.It is a part of military history that Sherman's sole purpose was to weaken
the Confederacy by recognized means of honorable warfare; but it cannot be
denied that there were a great many instances, unknown to him,
undoubtedly, of cowardly hold-ups of the helpless inhabitants, or
ransacking of private boxes and drawers in search of jewelry and other
family treasure.This is one of the misfortunes of war--one of war's
injustices.Such practices always exist even under the most rigid
discipline in great armies, and the jubilation of this march was such that
human nature asserted itself in the license of warfare more than on most
other occasions.General Washington met with similar situations in the
American Revolution.The practice is never confined to either army in
warfare.Opposed to Sherman were Wheeler's cavalry, and a large portion of the
Georgia State troops which were turned over by General G. W. Smith to
General Howell Cobb.Kilpatrick and his horsemen, proceeding toward Macon,
were confronted by Wheeler and Cobb, but the Federal troopers drove them
back into the town.However, they issued forth again, and on November 21st
there was a sharp engagement with Kilpatrick at Griswoldville.The
following day the Confederates were definitely checked and retreated.The night of November 22d, Sherman spent in the home of General Cobb, who
had been a member of the United States Congress and of Buchanan's Cabinet.Thousands of soldiers encamped that night on Cobb's plantation, using his
fences for camp-fire fuel.By Sherman's order, everything on the
plantation movable or destructible was carried away next day, or
destroyed.By the next night both corps of the Left Wing were at Milledgeville, and
on the 24th started for Sandersville.Howard's wing was at Gordon, and it
left there on the day that Slocum moved from Milledgeville for Irwin's
Crossroads.A hundred miles below Milledgeville was a place called Millen,
and here were many Federal prisoners which Sherman greatly desired to
release.With this in view he sent Kilpatrick toward Augusta to give the
impression that the army was marching thither, lest the Confederates
should remove the prisoners from Millen.Kilpatrick had reached Waynesboro
when he learned that the prisoners had been taken away.Here he again
encountered the Confederate cavalry under General Wheeler.A sharp fight
ensued and Kilpatrick drove Wheeler through the town toward Augusta.As
there was no further need of making a feint on Augusta, Kilpatrick turned
back toward the Left Wing.Wheeler quickly followed and at Thomas' Station
nearly surrounded him, but Kilpatrick cut his way out.Wheeler still
pressed on and Kilpatrick chose a good position at Buck Head Creek,
dismounted, and threw up breastworks.Wheeler attacked desperately, but
was repulsed, and Kilpatrick, after being reenforced by a brigade from
Davis' corps, joined the Left Wing at Louisville.On the whole, the great march was but little disturbed by the
Confederates.The Georgia militia, probably ten thousand in all, did what
they could to defend their homes and their firesides; but their endeavors
were futile against the vast hosts that were sweeping through the country.In the skirmishes that took place between Atlanta and the sea the militia
was soon brushed aside.Even their destroying of bridges and supplies in
front of the invading army checked its progress but for a moment, as it
was prepared for every such emergency.Wheeler, with his cavalry, caused
more trouble, and engaged Kilpatrick's attention a large part of the time.But even he did not seriously <DW44> the irresistible progress of the
legions of the North.The great army kept on its way by various routes, covering about fifteen
miles a day, and leaving a swath of destruction, from forty to sixty miles
wide, in its wake.Among the details attendant upon the march to the sea
was that of scientifically destroying the railroads that traversed the
region.Battalions of engineers had received special instruction in the
art, together with the necessary implements to facilitate rapid work.But
the infantry soon entered this service, too, and it was a common sight to
see a thousand soldiers in blue standing beside a stretch of railway, and,
when commanded, bend as one man and grasp the rail, and at a second
command to raise in unison, which brought a thousand railroad ties up on
end.Then the men fell upon them, ripping rail and tie apart, the rails to
be heated to a white heat and bent in fantastic shapes about some
convenient tree or other upright column, the ties being used as the fuel
with which to make the fires.All public buildings that might have a
military use were burned, together with a great number of private
dwellings and barns, some by accident, others wantonly.This fertile and
prosperous region, after the army had passed, was a scene of ruin and
desolation.As the army progressed, throngs of escaped slaves followed in its trail,
"from the baby in arms to the old <DW64> hobbling painfully along," says
General Howard, "<DW64>s of all sizes, in all sorts of patched costumes,
with carts and broken-down horses and mules to match."Many of the old
<DW64>s found it impossible to keep pace with the army for many days, and
having abandoned their homes and masters who could have cared for them,
they were left to die of hunger and exposure in that naked land.After the Ogeechee River was crossed, the character of the country was
greatly changed from that of central Georgia.No longer were there fertile
farms, laden with their Southern harvests of corn and vegetables, but
rather rice plantations and great pine forests, the solemn stillness of
which was broken by the tread of thousands of troops, the rumbling of
wagon-trains, and by the shouts and music of the marching men and of the
motley crowd of <DW64>s that followed.Day by day Sherman issued orders for the progress of the wings, but on
December 2d they contained the decisive words, "Savannah."What a tempting
prize was this fine Southern city, and how the Northern commander would
add to his laurels could he effect its capture!The memories clinging
about the historic old town, with its beautiful parks and its
magnolia-lined streets, are part of the inheritance of not only the South,
but of all America.Here Oglethorpe had bartered with the wild men of the
forest, and here, in the days of the Revolution, Count Pulaski and
Sergeant Jasper had given up their lives in the cause of liberty.Sherman had partially invested the city before the middle of December; but
it was well fortified and he refrained from assault.General Hardee, sent
by Hood from Tennessee, had command of the defenses, with about eighteen
thousand men.And there was Fort McAllister on the Ogeechee, protecting
the city on the south.But this obstruction to the Federals was soon
removed.General Hazen's division of the Fifteenth Corps was sent to
capture the fort.At five o'clock in the afternoon of the 13th Hazen's men
rushed through a shower of grape, over abatis and hidden torpedoes, scaled
the parapet and captured the garrison.That night Sherman boarded the
_Dandelion_, a Union vessel, in the river, and sent a message to the
outside world, the first since he had left Atlanta.Henceforth there was communication between the army and the Federal
squadron, under the command of Admiral Dahlgren.Among the vessels that
came up the river there was one that was received with great enthusiasm by
the soldiers.It brought mail, tons of it, for Sherman's army, the
accumulation of two months.One can imagine the eagerness with which
these war-stained veterans opened the longed-for letters and sought the
answer to the ever-recurring question, "How are things at home?"Sherman had set his heart on capturing Savannah; but, on December 15th, he
received a letter from Grant which greatly disturbed him.Grant ordered
him to leave his artillery and cavalry, with infantry enough to support
them, and with the remainder of his army to come by sea to Virginia and
join the forces before Richmond.Sherman prepared to obey, but hoped that
he would be able to capture the city before the transports would be ready
to carry him northward.He first called on Hardee to surrender the city, with a threat of
bombardment.Sherman hesitated to open with his guns
because of the bloodshed it would occasion, and on December 21st he was
greatly relieved to discover that Hardee had decided not to defend the
city, that he had escaped with his army the night before, by the one road
that was still open to him, which led across the Savannah River into the
Carolinas.The stream had been spanned by an improvised pontoon bridge,
consisting of river-boats, with planks from city wharves for flooring and
with old car-wheels for anchors.Sherman immediately took possession of
the city, and on December 22d he sent to President Lincoln this message:
"I beg to present to you, as a Christmas gift, the city of Savannah, with
one hundred and fifty heavy guns and plenty of ammunition, and also about
twenty-five thousand bales of cotton."As a matter of fact, over two
hundred and fifty guns were captured, and thirty-one thousand bales of
cotton.Events in the West now changed Grant's views as to Sherman's joining him
immediately in Virginia.On the 16th of December, General Thomas
accomplished the defeat and utter rout of Hood's army at Nashville.In
addition, it was found that, owing to lack of transports, it would take at
least two months to transfer Sherman's whole army by sea.Therefore, it
was decided that Sherman should march through the Carolinas, destroying
the railroads in both States as he went.A little more than a month
Sherman remained in Savannah.Then he began another great march, compared
with which, as Sherman himself declared, the march to the sea was as
child's play.The size of his army on leaving Savannah was practically the
same as when he left Atlanta--sixty thousand.It was divided into two
wings, under the same commanders, Howard and Slocum, and was to be
governed by the same rules.The
march from Savannah averaged ten miles a day, which, in view of the
conditions, was a very high average.The weather in the early part of the
journey was exceedingly wet and the roads were well-nigh impassable.Where
they were not actually under water the mud rendered them impassable until
corduroyed.Moreover, the troops had to wade streams, to drag themselves
through swamps and quagmires, and to remove great trees that had been
felled across their pathway.The city of Savannah was left under the control of General J. G. Foster,
and the Left Wing of Sherman's army under Slocum moved up the Savannah
River, accompanied by Kilpatrick, and crossed it at Sister's Ferry.The
river was overflowing its banks and the crossing, by means of a pontoon
bridge, was effected with the greatest difficulty.The Right Wing, under
Howard, embarked for Beaufort, South Carolina, and moved thence to
Pocotaligo, near the Broad River, whither Sherman had preceded it, and the
great march northward was fairly begun by February 1, 1865.Sherman had given out the word that he expected to go to Charleston or
Augusta, his purpose being to deceive the Confederates, since he had made
up his mind to march straight to Columbia, the capital of South Carolina.The two wings of the army were soon united and they continued their great
march from one end of the State of South Carolina to the other.The men
felt less restraint in devastating the country and despoiling the people
than they had felt in Georgia.The reason for this, given by Sherman and
others, was that there was a feeling of bitterness against South Carolina
as against no other State.It was this State that had led the procession
of seceding States and that had fired on Fort Sumter and brought on the
great war.No doubt this feeling, which pervaded the army, will account in
part for the reckless dealing with the inhabitants by the Federal
soldiery.The superior officers, however, made a sincere effort to
restrain lawlessness.On February 17th, Sherman entered Columbia, the mayor having come out and
surrendered the city.The Fifteenth Corps marched through the city and out
on the Camden road, the remainder of the army not having come within two
miles of the city.The conflagration
spread and ere the coming of the morning the best part of the city had
been laid in ashes.Before Sherman left Columbia he destroyed the machine-shops and everything
else which might aid the Confederacy.He left with the mayor one hundred
stand of arms with which to keep order, and five hundred head of cattle
for the destitute.As Columbia was approached by the Federals, the occupation of Charleston
by the Confederates became more and more untenable.In vain had the
governor of South Carolina pleaded with President Davis to reenforce
General Hardee, who occupied the city.Hardee thereupon evacuated the
historic old city--much of which was burned, whether by design or accident
is not known--and its defenses, including Fort Sumter, the bombardment of
which, nearly four years before, had precipitated the mighty conflict,
were occupied by Colonel Bennett, who came over from Morris Island.On March 11th, Sherman reached Fayetteville, North Carolina, where he
destroyed a fine arsenal.Hitherto, Sherman's march, except for the
annoyance of Wheeler's cavalry, had been but slightly impeded by the
Confederates.General Joseph B.
Johnston, his old foe of Resaca and Kenesaw Mountain, had been recalled
and was now in command of the troops in the Carolinas.No longer would the
streams and the swamps furnish the only resistance to the progress of the
Union army.The first engagement came at Averysboro on March 16th.General Hardee,
having taken a strong position, made a determined stand; but a division of
Slocum's wing, aided by Kilpatrick, soon put him to flight, with the loss
of several guns and over two hundred prisoners.The battle of Bentonville, which took place three days after that of
Averysboro, was more serious.Johnston had placed his whole army, probably
thirty-five thousand men, in the form of a V, the sides embracing the
village of Bentonville.Slocum engaged the Confederates while Howard was
hurried to the scene.On two days, the 19th and 20th of March, Sherman's
army fought its last battle in the Civil War.But Johnston, after making
several attacks, resulting in considerable losses on both sides, withdrew
his army during the night, and the Union army moved to Goldsboro.The
losses at Bentonville were: Federal, 1,527; Confederate, 2,606.At Goldsboro the Union army was reenforced by its junction with Schofield,
who had come out of the West with over twenty-two thousand men from the
army of Thomas in Tennessee.Sherman's third great march was practically over.As to the relative
importance of the second and third, Sherman declares in his memoirs, he
would place that from Atlanta to the sea at one, and that from Savannah
through the Carolinas at ten.Leaving his army in charge of Schofield, Sherman went to City Point, in
Virginia, where he had a conference with General Grant and President
Lincoln, and plans for the final campaign were definitely arranged.He
returned to Goldsboro late in March, and, pursuing Johnston, received,
finally, on April 26th the surrender of his army.[Illustration: BEFORE THE MARCH TO THE SEA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]These two photographs of General Sherman were taken in 1864--the year that
made him an international figure, before his march to the sea which
electrified the civilized world, and exposed once for all the crippled
condition of the Confederacy.After that autumn expedition, the problem of
the Union generals was merely to contend with detached armies, no longer
with the combined States of the Confederacy.The latter had no means of
extending further support to the dwindling troops in the field.Sherman
was the chief Union exponent of the tactical gift that makes marches count
as much as fighting.In the early part of 1864 he made his famous raid
across Mississippi from Jackson to Meridian and back again, destroying the
railroads, Confederate stores, and other property, and desolating the
country along the line of march.In May he set out from Chattanooga for
the invasion of Georgia.For his success in this campaign he was
appointed, on August 12th, a major-general in the regular army.On
November 12th, he started with the pick of his men on his march to the
sea.After the capture of Savannah, December 21st, Sherman's fame was
secure; yet he was one of the most heartily execrated leaders of the war.There is a hint of a smile in the right-hand picture.The left-hand
portrait reveals all the sternness and determination of a leader
surrounded by dangers, about to penetrate an enemy's country against the
advice of accepted military authorities.[Illustration: THE ATLANTA BANK BEFORE THE MARCH TO THE SEA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]As this photograph was taken, the wagons stood in the street of Atlanta
ready to accompany the Federals in their impending march to the sea.The
most interesting thing is the bank building on the corner, completely
destroyed, although around it stand the stores of merchants entirely
untouched.Evidently there had been here faithful execution of Sherman's
orders to his engineers--to destroy all buildings and property of a public
nature, such as factories, foundries, railroad stations, and the like; but
to protect as far as possible strictly private dwellings and enterprises.Those of a later generation who witnessed the growth of Atlanta within
less than half a century after this photograph was taken, and saw tall
office-buildings and streets humming with industry around the location in
this photograph, will find in it an added fascination.[Illustration: "TUNING UP"--A DAILY DRILL IN THE CAPTURED FORT

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Here Sherman's men are seen at daily drill in Atlanta.This photograph has
an interest beyond most war pictures, for it gives a clear idea of the
soldierly bearing of the men that were to march to the sea.There was an
easy carelessness in their appearance copied from their great commander,
but they were never allowed to become slouchy.Sherman was the antithesis
of a martinet, but he had, in the Atlanta campaign, molded his army into
the "mobile machine" that he desired it to be, and he was anxious to keep
the men up to this high pitch of efficiency for the performance of still
greater deeds.No better disciplined army existed in the world at the time
Sherman's "<DW15>s" set out for the sea.[Illustration: CUTTING LOOSE FROM THE BASE, NOVEMBER 12th

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB."On the 12th of November the railroad and telegraph communications with
the rear were broken and the army stood detached from all friends,
dependent on its own resources and supplies," writes Sherman.Meanwhile
all detachments were marching rapidly to Atlanta with orders to break up
the railroad en route and "generally to so damage the country as to make
it untenable to the enemy."Sherman, in
a home letter written from Grand Gulf, Mississippi, May 6, 1863, stated
clearly his views regarding the destruction of property.Speaking of the
wanton havoc wrought on a fine plantation in the path of the army, he
added: "It is done, of course, by the accursed stragglers who won't fight
but hang behind and disgrace our cause and country.Bowie had fled,
leaving everything on the approach of our troops.Of course, devastation
marked the whole path of the army, and I know all the principal officers
detest the infamous practice as much as I do.Of course, I expect and do
take corn, bacon, ham, mules, and everything to support an army, and don't
object much to the using of fences for firewood, but this universal
burning and wanton destruction of private property is not justified in
war."[Illustration: THE BUSTLE OF DEPARTURE FROM ATLANTA

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Sherman's men worked like beavers during their last few days in Atlanta.There was no time to be lost; the army was gotten under way with that
precision which marked all Sherman's movements.In the upper picture,
finishing touches are being put to the railroad, and in the lower is seen
the short work that was made of such public buildings as might be of the
slightest use in case the Confederates should recapture the town.As far
back as Chattanooga, while plans for the Atlanta campaign were being
formed, Sherman had been revolving a subsequent march to the sea in case
he was successful.He had not then made up his mind whether it should be
in the direction of Mobile or Savannah, but his Meridian campaign, in
Mississippi, had convinced him that the march was entirely feasible, and
gradually he worked out in his mind its masterly details.At seven in the
morning on November 16th, Sherman rode out along the Decatur road, passed
his marching troops, and near the spot where his beloved McPherson had
fallen, paused for a last look at the city."Behind us," he says, "lay
Atlanta, smouldering and in ruins, the black smoke rising high in air and
hanging like a pall over the ruined city."All about could be seen the
glistening gun-barrels and white-topped wagons, "and the men marching
steadily and rapidly with a cheery look and swinging pace."Some
regimental band struck up "John Brown," and the thousands of voices of the
vast army joined with a mighty chorus in song.A feeling of exhilaration
pervaded the troops.This marching into the unknown held for them the
allurement of adventure, as none but Sherman knew their destination.But
as he worked his way past them on the road, many a group called out,
"Uncle Billy, I guess Grant is waiting for us at Richmond."The
devil-may-care spirit of the troops brought to Sherman's mind grave
thoughts of his own responsibility.He knew that success would be regarded
as a matter of course, but should he fail the march would be set down as
"the wild adventure of a crazy fool."He had no intention of marching
directly to Richmond, but from the first his objective was the seacoast,
at Savannah or Port Royal, or even Pensacola, Florida.[Illustration: RUINS IN ATLANTA]


[Illustration: THE GUNS THAT SHERMAN TOOK ALONG

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]In Hood's hasty evacuation of Atlanta many of his guns were left behind.These 12-pounder Napoleon bronze field-pieces have been gathered by the
Federals from the abandoned fortifications, which had been equipped
entirely with field artillery, such as these.It was an extremely useful
capture for Sherman's army, whose supply of artillery had been somewhat
limited during the siege, and still further reduced by the necessity to
fortify Atlanta.On the march to the sea Sherman took with him only
sixty-five field-pieces.The <DW64> refugees in the lower picture recall an
embarrassment of the march to the sea."<DW64>s of all sizes" flocked in
the army's path and stayed there, a picturesque procession, holding
tightly to the skirts of the army which they believed had come for the
sole purpose of setting them free.The cavalcade of <DW64>s soon became so
numerous that Sherman became anxious for his army's sustenance, and
finding an old gray-haired black at Covington, Sherman explained to him
carefully that if the <DW64>s continued to swarm after the army it would
fail in its purpose and they would not get their freedom.Sherman believed
that the old man spread this news to the slaves along the line of march,
and in part saved the army from being overwhelmed by the contrabands.[Illustration: <DW64>s FLOCKING IN THE ARMY'S PATH

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: THE DEFENDER OF SAVANNAH]

The task of General Hardee in defending Savannah was one of peculiar
difficulty.He had only eighteen thousand men, and he was uncertain where
Sherman would strike.Some supposed that Sherman would move at once upon
Charleston, but Hardee argued that the Union army would have to establish
a new base of supplies on the seacoast before attempting to cross the
numerous deep rivers and swamps of South Carolina.Hardee's task therefore
was to hold Savannah just as long as possible, and then to withdraw
northward to unite with the troops which General Bragg was assembling, and
with the detachments scattered at this time over the Carolinas.In
protecting his position around Savannah, Fort McAllister was of prime
importance, since it commanded the Great Ogeechee River in such a way as
to prevent the approach of the Federal fleet, Sherman's dependence for
supplies.It was accordingly manned by a force of two hundred under
command of Major G. W. Anderson, provided with fifty days' rations for use
in case the work became isolated.About
noon of December 13th, Major Anderson's men saw troops in blue moving
about in the woods.The artillery on the land side
of the fort was turned upon them as they advanced from one position to
another, and sharpshooters picked off some of their officers.At half-past
four o'clock, however, the long-expected charge was made from three
different directions, so that the defenders, too few in number to hold the
whole line, were soon overpowered.Hardee now had to consider more
narrowly the best time for withdrawing from the lines at Savannah.[Illustration: FORT McALLISTER--THE LAST BARRIER TO THE SEA

COPYRIGHT, 1911 PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: WATERFRONT AT SAVANNAH, 1865

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]Savannah was better protected by nature from attack by land or water than
any other city near the Atlantic seaboard.Stretching to the north, east,
and southward lay swamps and morasses through which ran the river-approach
of twelve miles to the town.Innumerable small creeks separated the
marshes into islands over which it was out of the question for an army to
march without first building roads and bridging miles of waterways.The
Federal fleet had for months been on the blockade off the mouth of the
river, and Savannah had been closed to blockade runners since the fall of
Fort Pulaski in April, 1862.But obstructions and powerful batteries held
the river, and Fort McAllister, ten miles to the south, on the Ogeechee,
still held the city safe in its guardianship.[Illustration: FORT McALLISTER, THAT HELD THE FLEET AT BAY

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: THE FIFTEEN MINUTES' FIGHT

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Across these ditches at Fort McAllister, through entangling abatis, over
palisading, the Federals had to fight every inch of their way against the
Confederate garrison up to the very doors of their bomb-proofs, before the
defenders yielded on December 13th.Sherman had at once perceived that the
position could be carried only by a land assault.The fort was strongly
protected by ditches, palisades, and plentiful abatis; marshes and streams
covered its flanks, but Sherman's troops knew that shoes and clothing and
abundant rations were waiting for them just beyond it, and had any of them
been asked if they could take the fort their reply would have been in the
words of the poem: "Ain't we simply got to take it?"Sherman selected for
the honor of the assault General Hazen's second division of the Fifteenth
Corps, the same which he himself had commanded at Shiloh and Vicksburg.Gaily the troops crossed the bridge on the morning of the 13th.Sherman
was watching anxiously through his glass late in the afternoon when a
Federal steamer came up the river and signaled the query: "Is Fort
McAllister taken?"To which Sherman sent reply: "Not yet, but it will be
in a minute."At that instant Sherman saw Hazen's troops emerge from the
woods before the fort, "the lines dressed as on parade, with colors
flying."Immediately dense clouds of smoke belching from the fort
enveloped the Federals.There was a pause; the smoke cleared away, and,
says Sherman, "the parapets were blue with our men."[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.[Illustration: A BIG GUN AT FORT McALLISTER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.Fort McAllister is at last in complete possession of the Federals, and a
group of the men who had charged over these ramparts has arranged itself
before the camera as if in the very act of firing the great gun that
points seaward across the marshes, toward Ossabaw Sound.There is one very
peculiar thing proved by this photograph--the gun itself is almost in a
fixed position as regards range and sweep of fire.Instead of the
elevating screw to raise or depress the muzzle, there has been substituted
a block of wood wedged with a heavy spike, and the narrow pit in which the
gun carriage is sunk admits of it being turned but a foot or so to right
or left.It evidently controlled one critical point in the river, but
could not have been used in lending any aid to the repelling of General
Hazen's attack.The officer pointing with outstretched arm is indicating
the very spot at which a shell fired from his gun would fall.The men in
the trench are artillerymen of General Hazen's division of the Fifteenth
Corps; their appearance in their fine uniforms, polished breastplates and
buttons, proves that Sherman's men could not have presented the ragged
appearance that they are often pictured as doing in the war-time sketches.That Army and Navy have come together is proved also by the figure of a
marine from the fleet, who is standing at "Attention" just above the
breach of the gun.Next, leaning on his saber, is a cavalryman, in short
jacket and chin-strap.[Illustration: THE SPOILS OF VICTORY]

THE TROOPS THAT MARCHED TO THE SEA BECOME DAY-LABORERS

Here are the men that marched to the sea doing their turn as day-laborers,
gleefully trundling their wheelbarrows, gathering up everything of value
in Fort McAllister to swell the size of Sherman's "Christmas present."Brigadier-General W. B. Hazen, after his men had successfully stormed the
stubbornly defended fort, reported the capture of twenty-four pieces of
ordnance, with their equipment, forty tons of ammunition, a month's supply
of food for the garrison, and the small arms of the command.In the upper
picture the army engineers are busily at work removing a great 48-pounder
8-inch Columbiad that had so long repelled the Federal fleet.There is
always work enough and to spare for the engineers both before and after
the capture of a fortified position.In the wheelbarrows is a harvest of
shells and torpedoes.These deadly instruments of destruction had been
relied upon by the Confederates to protect the land approach to Fort
McAllister, which was much less strongly defensible on that side than at
the waterfront.While Sherman's army was approaching Savannah one of his
officers had his leg blown off by a torpedo buried in the road and stepped
on by his horse.After that Sherman set a line of Confederate prisoners
across the road to march ahead of the army, and no more torpedoes were
found.After the capture of Fort McAllister the troops set to work
gingerly scraping about wherever the ground seemed to have been disturbed,
trying to find and remove the dangerous hidden menaces to life.At last
the ground was rendered safe and the troops settled down to the occupation
of Fort McAllister where the bravely fighting little Confederate garrison
had held the key to Savannah.The city was the first to fall of the
Confederacy's Atlantic seaports, now almost locked from the outside world
by the blockade.By the capture of Fort McAllister, which crowned the
march to the sea, Sherman had numbered the days of the war.The fall of
the remaining ports was to follow in quick succession, and by Washington's
Birthday, 1865, the entire coast-line was to be in possession of the
Federals.[Illustration: SHERMAN'S TROOPS DISMANTLING FORT McALLISTER]

Durham's Station, N. C., were begun the negotiations between Johnston and
Sherman which finally led to that event.The two generals met there on
April 17th; it was a highly dramatic moment, for Sherman had in his pocket
the cipher message just received telling of the assassination of Lincoln.[Illustration: THE END OF THE MARCH--BENNETT'S FARMHOUSE

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]This craft, the "Commodore Perry," was an old New York ferryboat purchased
and hastily pressed into service by the Federal navy to help solve the
problem of patrolling the three thousand miles of coast, along which the
blockade must be made effective.In order to penetrate the intricate
inlets and rivers, light-draft fighting-vessels were required, and the
most immediate means of securing these was to purchase every sort of
merchant craft that could possibly be adapted to the purposes of war,
either as a fighting-vessel or as a transport.The ferryboat in the
picture has been provided with guns and her pilot-houses armored.A
casemate of iron plates has been provided for the gunners.The Navy
Department purchased and equipped in all one hundred and thirty-six
vessels in 1861, and by the end of the year had increased the number of
seamen in the service from 7,600 to over 22,000.Many of these new
recruits saw their first active service aboard the converted ferryboats,
tugboats, and other frail and unfamiliar vessels making up the nondescript
fleet that undertook to cut off the commerce of the South.The experience
thus gained under very unusual circumstances placed them of necessity
among the bravest sailors of the navy.[Illustration: THE LAST PORT CLOSED

of this port the most powerful naval force ever assembled up to that
time--fifty-five ships of war, including five ironclads, altogether
carrying six hundred guns.The upper picture shows the nature of the
palisade, nine feet high, over which some two thousand marines attempted
to pass; the lower shows interior of the works after the destructive

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]It frequently took a blockade-runner to
catch a blockade-runner, and as the Federal navy captured ship after ship
of this character they began to acquire a numerous fleet of swift steamers
from which it was difficult for any vessel to get away.The "Vance"
brought many a cargo to the hungry Southern ports, slipping safely by the
blockading fleet and back again till her shrewd Captain Willie felt that
he could give the slip to anything afloat.On her last trip she had safely
gotten by the Federal vessels lying off the harbor of Wilmington, North
Carolina, and was dancing gleefully on her way with a bountiful cargo of
cotton and turpentine when, on September 10, 1864, in latitude 34 deg.W., a vessel was sighted which rapidly bore down upon
her.It proved to be the "Santiago de Cuba," Captain O. S. Glisson.The
rapidity with which the approaching vessel overhauled him was enough to
convince Captain Willie that she was in his own class.The "Santiago de
Cuba" carried eleven guns, and the "Vance" humbly hove to, to receive the
prize-crew which took her to Boston, where she was condemned.In the
picture we see her lying high out of the water, her valuable cargo having
been removed and sold to enrich by prize-money the officers and men of her
fleet captor.[Illustration: A GREYHOUND CAUGHT--WRECK OF THE BLOCKADE-RUNNER "COLT"]

The wreck of this blockade-runner, the "Colt," lies off Sullivan's Island,
Charleston Harbor, in 1865.The coast of the Carolinas, before the war was
over, was strewn with just such sights as this.The bones of former
"greyhounds" became landmarks by which the still uncaptured
blockade-runners could get their bearings and lay a course to safety.If
one of these vessels were cut off from making port and surrounded by
Federal pursuers, the next best thing was to run her ashore in shallow
water, where the gunboats could not follow and where her valuable cargo
could be secured by the Confederates.A single cargo at war-time prices
was enough to pay more than the cost of the vessel.Regular auctions were
held in Charleston or Wilmington, where prices for goods not needed by the
Confederate Government were run up to fabulous figures.The business of
blockade-running was well organized abroad, especially in England.One
successful trip was enough to start the enterprise with a handsome profit.A blockade-runner like the "Kate," which made forty trips or more, would
enrich her owners almost beyond the dreams of avarice.[Illustration: THE CONFEDERATE RAM "STONEWALL"]

Here are two striking views in the Port Royal dry-dock of the Confederate
ram "Stonewall."When this powerful fighting-ship sailed from Copenhagen,
Jan.T. J. Page, C. S. N., the Federal
navy became confronted by its most formidable antagonist during the war.In March, 1863, the Confederacy had negotiated a loan of L3,000,000, and
being thus at last in possession of the necessary funds, Captain Bulloch
and Mr.Slidell arranged with M. Arman, who was a member of the
_Corps-Legislatif_ and proprietor of a large shipyard at Bordeaux, for the
construction of ironclad ships of war.Slidell had already received
assurances from persons in the confidence of Napoleon III that the
building of the ships in the French yards would not be interfered with,
and that getting them to sea would be connived at by the Government.Owing
to the indubitable proof laid before the Emperor by the Federal diplomats
at Paris, he was compelled to revoke the guarantee that had been given to
Slidell and Bulloch.A plan was arranged, however, by which M. Arman
should sell the vessels to various European powers; and he disposed of the
ironclad ram "Sphinx" to the Danish Government, then at war with Prussia.Delivery of the ship at Copenhagen was not made, however, till after the
war had ceased, and no trouble was experienced by the Confederates in
arranging for the purchase of the vessel.On January 24, 1865, she
rendezvoused off Quiberon, on the French coast; the remainder of her
officers, crew, and supplies were put aboard of her; the Confederate flag
was hoisted over her, and she was christened the "Stonewall."Already the
vessel was discovered to have sprung a leak, and Captain Page ran into
Ferrol, Spain.Here dock-yard facilities were at first granted, but were
withdrawn at the protest of the American Minister.While Captain Page was
repairing his vessel as best he could, the "Niagara" and the "Sacramento"
appeared, and after some weeks the "Stonewall" offered battle in vain.[Illustration]

THE LAST INVASION OF TENNESSEE--FRANKLIN--NASHVILLE


In the latter days of September, 1864, the Confederate Army of Tennessee
lay in the vicinity of Macon, Georgia.It was a dispirited body of men,
homesick and discouraged.For four long months, first under one leader and
then under another, it had opposed, step by step, Sherman's advance toward
Atlanta, and now that important strategic point was in the hands of the
Federal forces.About the middle of July the President of the Confederacy
had seen fit to remove Joseph E. Johnston from the command and replace him
with John B. Hood.The latter's habit of mind and methods of action led
the Richmond authorities to believe that he would proceed very differently
from Johnston, and in this he did not disappoint them.The results showed
that Johnston's Fabian policy was by far the better one under the
circumstances.Sherman had the stronger army, but he was compelled
constantly to detach portions of it in order to guard his lengthening line
of supplies.The one thing he desired most was that his opponent should
assume an aggressive attitude.Hood's idea was precipitation rather than
patience, and in consequence on the 2d of September General Slocum entered
the coveted city.On the 22d of that month President Davis visited the Southern Army, and
made a memorable address to the troops.He promised them--and they were
delighted at the news--that they would soon be back in Tennessee, for a
fresh invasion of that State had been planned.This would, declared the
speaker, place Sherman in a worse predicament than that in which Napoleon
found himself at Moscow.But the Federal general had at least the
advantage of learning what was going to happen to him, for the President's
words were reported verbatim in the Southern papers, and he prepared to
meet his antagonists.Thomas, with the Army of the Cumberland, was sent to
Nashville while Schofield, with his smaller force known as the Army of the
Ohio, returned to Knoxville where he had spent the previous winter, to
await Hood's advance.By the 1st of October the latter was across the
Chattahoochee in the hope of drawing Sherman from Atlanta.There was a
brave fight at Allatoona where General Corse "held the fort," but Sherman,
although he followed the Confederate army, was unable to bring on a
general engagement.His great plan of a march through Georgia to the sea was now fully formed
in his mind.He had not yet obtained Grant's sanction to the scheme, but
he ordered Schofield to cooperate with Thomas and sent the Fourth Corps as
further assistance.He himself ceased the pursuit of Hood at Gaylesville
and turned back to Atlanta, confident that the fate of Tennessee was safe
in the hands of his ablest lieutenant, George H. Thomas.Hood appeared on
the 26th of October at Decatur on the south bank of the Tennessee River.Lack of supplies had delayed his advance, but even so his performances had
greatly alarmed the North.Twice had he interposed between Sherman and the
Federal base and had destroyed many miles of railway, but what in other
circumstances would have placed the Union leader in a dangerous
predicament was now of little moment, since the latter was rapidly making
preparations to cut himself off from all communication with the source of
his supplies.It was necessary that Hood should have the assistance of
Forrest, whose dauntless cavalry had been playing great havoc with the
Federal stores in western Tennessee, so he moved to Florence before
crossing the river, and here Forrest joined him on November 14th.In the
meantime, Schofield, with about twenty-eight thousand men, had reached
Pulaski on the way to encounter the Southern advance.Now began a series of brilliant strategic moves, kept up for a fortnight
before the two small armies--they were of almost equal strength met in
one awful clash.Hood's efforts were bent toward cutting Schofield off
from Thomas at Nashville.There was a mad race for the Duck River, and the
Federals got over at Columbia in the very nick of time.The Southern
leader, by a skilful piece of strategy and a forced march, pushed on to
Spring Hill ahead of his opponent.He was in an excellent position to
annihilate General Stanley who was in advance, and then crush the
remainder of the Federals who were moving with the slow wagon-trains.But
owing to a number of strange mishaps, which brought forth much
recrimination but no satisfactory explanation, the Union army slipped by
with little damage and entrenched itself at Franklin on the Harpeth River.Of all the dark days of Confederate history--and they were many--the 29th
of November, 1864, has been mourned as that of "lost opportunities."Schofield did not expect, or desire, a battle at Franklin, but he was
treated to one the following afternoon when the Confederates came up, and
it was of the most severe nature.The first attack was made as the light
began to wane, and the Federal troops stood their ground although the
orders had been to withdraw, because through some blunder two brigades in
blue had been stationed, unsupported, directly in front of Hood's
approach.The stubborn resistance of Schofield's army only increased the
ardor of the opponents.It is said that thirteen separate assaults were
made upon the Union entrenchments, and the fearful carnage was finally
carried into the streets and among the dooryards of the little town.At
nine o'clock the fury of the iron storm was quelled.Five Confederate
generals, including the gallant Cleburne, lay dead upon the field.In two
of the Southern brigades all the general officers were either killed or
wounded.Hood's loss was about sixty-three hundred, nearly three times
that of Schofield.By midnight the latter was on his way, uninterrupted,
to Nashville.Meanwhile Thomas was performing a herculean task within the
fortifications of that capital city.He had received a large number of
raw recruits and a motley collection of troops from garrisons in the West.These had to be drilled into an efficient army, and not one move to fight
would Thomas make until this had been done.Grant, in Virginia, grew
impatient and the Northern papers clamored for an attack on Hood, who had
now arrived with thirty-eight thousand men before the city.Finally Grant
took action, and General Logan was hurrying to assume the Federal command.But by the time he reached Louisville there was no need for his services.Thomas had for some days been ready with his force of forty-five thousand,
but to increase the difficulties of his position, a severe storm of
freezing rain made action impossible until the morning of December 15th.The Union lines of defense were in a semi-circle and Hood was on the
southeast, lightly entrenched.The first assault on his right wing
followed by one on his left, forced the Confederates back to a second
position two miles to the south, and that was the first day's work.Hood
had detached a part of his forces and he did all he could to gain time
until he might recover his full strength.But he had respite only until
Thomas was ready on the morrow, which was about noon.The Union army
deployed in front of the Southerners and overlapped their left wing.An
attack on the front was bravely met and repulsed by the Confederates, and
the Federal leader, extending his right, compelled his opponent to stretch
his own lines more and more.Finally they broke just to the left of the
center, and a general forward movement on the Union side ended in the
utter rout of the splendid and courageous Army of Tennessee.It melted away in disorder; the pursuit was vigorous, and only a small
portion reassembled at Columbia and fell back with a poor show of order
behind the Tennessee.Many military historians have seen in the battle of Nashville the most
crushing defeat of the war.Certainly no other brought such complete ruin
upon a large and well-organized body of troops.[Illustration: RUSHING A FEDERAL BATTERY OUT OF JOHNSONVILLE

frightened into panic and flight when the bold Confederate raider,

THE SIEGE AND FALL OF PETERSBURG

    It is not improbable that Grant might have made more headway by
    leaving a sufficient part of his army in the trenches in front of
    Petersburg and by moving with a heavy force far to the west upon Lee's
    communications; or, if it were determined to capture the place _a main
    forte_, by making a massed attack upon some point in the center after
    suitable mining operations had weakened Lee's defenses and prepared
    for such an operation.But the end was to come with opening spring.To
    the far-sighted, this was no longer doubtful.The South must succumb
    to the greater material resources of the North, despite its courage
    and its sacrifices.--_Colonel T. A. Dodge, U. S. A., in "A Bird's-Eye
    View of Our Civil War."_


During the winter of 1864-65, General Lee, fighting Grant without, was
fighting famine within.The shivering, half-clad soldiers of the South
crouched over feeble fires in their entrenchments.The men were exposed to
the rain, snow, and sleet; sickness and disease soon added their horrors
to the desolation.The
life of the Confederacy was ebbing fast.Behind Union breastworks, early in 1865, General Grant was making
preparations for the opening of a determined campaign with the coming of
spring.Mile after mile had been added to his entrenchments, and they now
extended to Hatcher's Run on the left.The Confederate lines had been
stretched until they were so thin that there was constant danger of
breaking.A. P. Hill was posted on the right; Gordon and Anderson held the
center, and Longstreet was on the left.Union troops were mobilizing in
front of Petersburg.By February 1st, Sherman was fairly off from Savannah
on his northward march to join Grant.He was weak in cavalry and Grant
determined to bring Sheridan from the Shenandoah, whence the bulk of
Early's forces had been withdrawn, and send him to assist Sherman.Sheridan left Winchester February 27th, wreaking much destruction as he
advanced, but circumstances compelled him to seek a new base at White
House.On March 27th he formed a junction with the armies of the Potomac
and the James.Such were the happenings that prompted Lee to prepare for
the evacuation of Petersburg.And he might be able, in his rapid marches,
to outdistance Grant, join his forces with those of Johnston, fall on
Sherman, destroy one wing of the Union army and arouse the hopes of his
soldiers, and prolong the life of his Government.General Grant knew the condition of Lee's army and, with the unerring
instinct of a military leader, surmised what the plan of the Southern
general must be.He decided to move on the left, destroy both the Danville
and South Side railroads, and put his army in better condition to pursue.General Lee, in order to get Grant to look another way for a while,
decided to attack Grant's line on the right, and gain some of the works.This would compel Grant to draw some of his force from his left and secure
a way of escape to the west.This bold plan was left for execution to the
gallant Georgian, General John B. Gordon, who had successfully led the
reverse attack at Cedar Creek, in the Shenandoah, in October, 1864.Near
the crater stood Fort Stedman.Between it and the Confederate front, a
distance of about one hundred and fifty yards, was a strip of firm earth,
in full view of both picket lines.Across this space some deserters had
passed to the Union entrenchments.General Gordon took advantage of this
fact and accordingly selected his men, who, at the sound of the signal
gun, should disarm the Federal pickets, while fifty more men were to cross
the open space quickly with axes and cut away the abatis, and three
hundred others were to rush through the opening, and capture the fort and
guns.At four o'clock on the morning of March 25, 1865, Gordon had everything in
readiness.His chosen band wore white strips of cloth across the breast,
that they might distinguish each other in the hand-to-hand fight that
would doubtless ensue.Behind these men half of Lee's army was massed to
support the attack.In the silence of the early morning, a gunshot rang
out from the Confederate works.Not a Federal picket-shot was heard.The
axemen rushed across the open and soon the thuds of their axes told of the
cutting away of the abatis.The three hundred surged through the entrance,
overpowered the gunners, captured batteries to the right and to the left,
and were in control of the situation.Gordon's corps of about five
thousand was on hand to sustain the attack but the remaining reserves,
through failure of the guides, did not come, and the general found himself
cut off with a rapidly increasing army surrounding him.Fort Haskell, on the left, began to throw its shells.Under its cover,
heavy columns of Federals sent by General Parke, now commanding the Ninth
Corps, pressed forward.The Confederates resisted the charge, and from the
captured Fort Stedman and the adjoining batteries poured volley after
volley on Willcox's advancing lines of blue.The Northerners fell back,
only to re-form and renew the attack.This time they secured a footing,
and for twenty minutes the fighting was terrific.Then across the brow of the hill swept the command of Hartranft.The furious musketry, and
artillery directed by General Tidball, shrivelled up the ranks of Gordon
until they fled from the fort and its neighboring batteries in the midst
of withering fire, and those who did not were captured.This was the last
aggressive effort of the expiring Confederacy in front of Petersburg, and
it cost three thousand men.The affair at Fort Stedman did not turn Grant from his plans against the
Confederate right.With the railroads here destroyed, Richmond would be
completely cut off.On the morning of the 29th, as previously arranged,
the movement began.Sheridan swept to the south with his cavalry, as if he
were to fall upon the railroads.General Warren, with fifteen thousand
men, was working his way through the tangled woods and low swamps in the
direction of Lee's right.At the same time, Lee stripped his entrenchments
at Petersburg as much as he dared and hurried General Anderson, with
infantry, and Fitzhugh Lee, with cavalry, forward to hold the roads over
which he hoped to escape.On Friday morning, March 31st, the opposing
forces, the Confederates much reenforced, found themselves at Dinwiddie
Court House.The woods and swamps prevented the formation of a regular
line of battle.Lee made his accustomed flank movement, with heavy loss to
the Federals as they tried to move in the swampy forests.The Northerners
finally were ready to advance when it was found that Lee had fallen back.During the day and night, reenforcements were coming in from all sides.The Confederates had taken their position at Five Forks.Early the next afternoon, the 1st of April, Sheridan, reenforced by
Warren, was arranging his troops for battle.The day was nearly spent when
all was in readiness.The sun was not more than two hours high when the
Northern army moved toward that of the South, defended by a breastwork
behind a dense undergrowth of pines.Through this mass of timber the
Federals crept with bayonets fixed.They charged upon the Confederates,
but, at the same time, a galling fire poured into them from the left,
spreading dismay and destruction in their midst.The intrepid Sheridan
urged his black battle-charger, the famous Rienzi, now known as
Winchester, up and down the lines, cheering his men on in the fight.He
seemed to be everywhere at once.The Confederate left was streaming down
the White Oak Road.But General Crawford had reached a cross-road, by
taking a circuitous route, and the Southern army was thus shut off from
retreat.The Federal cavalry had dismounted and was doing its full share
of work.The Confederates soon found themselves trapped, and the part of
their army in action that day was nearly annihilated.With night came the news of the crushing blow to Lee.General Grant was
seated by his camp-fire surrounded by his staff, when a courier dashed
into his presence with the message of victory.Soon from every great gun
along the Union line belched forth the sheets of flame.The earth shook
with the awful cannonade.Mortar shells made huge parabolas through the
air.The Union batteries crept closer and closer to the Confederate lines
and the balls crashed into the streets of the doomed city.At dawn of the 2nd of April the grand assault began.The Federal troops
sprang forward with a rush.Despite the storms of grape and canister, the
Sixth Corps plunged through the battery smoke, and across the walls,
pushing the brave defenders to the inner works.The whole corps penetrated
the lines and swept everything before it toward Hatcher's Run.Some of the
troops even reached the South Side Railroad, where the brave General A. P.
Hill fell mortally wounded.Everywhere, the blue masses poured into the works.General Ord, on the
right of the Sixth Corps, helped to shut the Confederate right into the
city.General Parke, with the Ninth Corps, carried the main line.The thin
gray line could no longer stem the tide that was engulfing it.The
Confederate troops south of Hatcher's Run fled to the west, and fought
General Miles until General Sheridan and a division from Meade appeared on
the scene.By noon the Federals held the line of the outer works from Fort
Gregg to the Appomattox.The last stronghold carried was Fort Gregg, at
which the men of Gibbon's corps had one of the most desperate struggles of
the war.The Confederates now fell back to the inner fortifications and
the siege of Petersburg came to an end.[Illustration: A BATTERED RELIC OF COLONIAL DAYS IN PETERSBURG

the visitation of the falling shells fit habitations for mankind.Many of
these handsome residences were utterly destroyed, their fixtures shattered
beyond repair; their wainscoting, built when the Commonwealth of Virginia
was ruled over by the representative of King George, was torn from the
walls and, bursting into flames, made a funeral pyre of past comforts and
magnificence.The havoc wrought upon the dwellings of the town was heavy;
certain localities suffered more than others, and those residents who
seemed to dwell in the safest zones had been ever ready to open their
houses to the sick and wounded of Lee's army.As Grant's troops marched
in, many pale faces gazed out at them from the windows, and at the
doorsteps stood men whose wounds exempted them from ever bearing arms
again.[Illustration: THE SHATTERED DOORWAY

the two lines, separated by only fifty yards, sallies and counter-sallies
were continual occurrences after dark.In stealthy sorties one side or the

time, Lee entrusted the last desperate effort to break through the
tightening Federal lines, March 25, 1865.Lee was confronted by the
dilemma of either being starved out of Petersburg and Richmond, or of
getting out himself and uniting his army to that of Johnston in North
Carolina to crush Sherman before Grant could reach him.Gordon was to
begin this latter, almost impossible, task by an attack on Fort Stedman,
which the Confederates believed to be the weakest point in the Federal
fortifications.The position had been captured from them in the beginning,
and they knew that the nature of the ground and its nearness to their own
lines had made it difficult to strengthen it very much.It was planned to
surprise the fort before daylight.Below are seen the rabbit-like burrows
of Gracie's Salient, past which Gordon led his famished men.When the
order came to go forward, they did not flinch, but hurled themselves
bravely against fortifications far stronger than their own.Three columns
of a hundred picked men each moved down the <DW72> shown on the left and
advanced in the darkness against Stedman.They were to be followed by a
division.Through the gap which the storming parties were expected to open
in the Federal lines, Gordon's columns would rush in both directions and a
cavalry force was to sweep on and destroy the pontoon bridges across the
Appomattox and to raid City Point, breaking up the Federal base.It was no
light task, for although Fort Stedman itself was weak, it was flanked by
Battery No.An
attacking party on the right would be exposed to an enfilading fire in
crossing the plain; while on the left the approach was difficult be cause
of ravines, one of which the Confederate engineers had turned into a pond
by damming a creek.All night long General Gordon's wife, with the brave
women of Petersburg, sat up tearing strips of white cloth, to be tied on
the arms of the men in the storming parties so that they could tell friend
from foe in the darkness and confusion of the assault.Before the
sleep-dazed Federals could offer effective resistance, Gordon's men had
possession of the fort and the batteries.Only after one of the severest
engagements of the siege were the Confederates driven back.[Illustration: GRACIE'S SALIENT--AFTER GORDON'S FORLORN HOPE HAD CHARGED]


APRIL SECOND--"THIS IS A SAD BUSINESS"

As his general watched, this boy fought to stem the Federal rush--but
fell, his breast pierced by a bayonet, in the trenches of Fort Mahone.It
is heart-rending to look at a picture such as this; it is sad to think of
it and to write about it.Here is a boy of only fourteen years, his face
innocent of a razor, his feet unshod and stockingless in the bitter April
weather.It is to be hoped that the man who slew him has forgotten it, for
this face would haunt him surely.Many who fought in the blue ranks were
young, but in the South there were whole companies made up of such boys as
this.At the battle of Newmarket the scholars of the Virgina Military
Institute, the eldest seventeen and the youngest twelve, marched from the
classrooms under arms, joined the forces of General Breckinridge, and
aided by their historic charge to gain a brilliant victory over the
Federal General Sigel.The never-give-in spirit was implanted in the youth
of the Confederacy, as well as in the hearts of the grizzled veterans.Lee
had inspired them, but in addition to this inspiration, as General Gordon
writes, "every man of them was supported by their extraordinary
consecration, resulting from the conviction that he was fighting in the
defense of home and the rights of his State.Hence their unfaltering faith
in the justice of the cause, their fortitude in the extremest privations,
their readiness to stand shoeless and shivering in the trenches at night
and to face any danger at their leader's call."[Illustration: COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.APPOMATTOX

    I now come to what I have always regarded--shall ever regard--as the
    most creditable episode in all American history--an episode without a
    blemish, imposing, dignified, simple, heroic.Two men met that day, representative of American civilization, the
    whole world looking on.The two were Grant and Lee--types each.Both
    rose, and rose unconsciously, to the full height of the occasion--and
    than that occasion there has been none greater.About it, and them,
    there was no theatrical display, no self-consciousness, no effort at
    effect.A great crisis was to be met; and they met that crisis as
    great countrymen should.Consider the possibilities; think for a
    moment of what that day might have been; you will then see cause to
    thank God for much.--_General Charles Francis Adams, U. S. V., in Phi
    Beta Kappa Address delivered at the University of Chicago, June 17,
    1902._


We are now to witness the closing scene of one of the greatest tragedies
ever enacted on the world's stage.Many and varied had been the scenes
during the war; the actors and their parts had been real.The wounds of
the South were bleeding; the North was awaiting the decisive blow.Fortunes, great and small, had melted away
by the hundreds of millions.In Richmond, the citadel of the waning
Confederacy, the people were starving.The Southern army, half clad and
without food, was but a shadow of its once proud self.Bravely and long
the men in gray had followed their adored leader.Now the limit of
endurance had been reached.It was the second day of April, 1865.Lee realized that after Petersburg
his beloved Richmond must fall.The order was given for the movement to
begin at eight o'clock that night.The darkness of the early morning of
the 3d was suddenly transformed into a lurid light overcasting the
heavens for miles around the famous city whose name had became a
household word over the civilized world.The
capital of the Confederacy, the pride of the South, toward which the Army
of the Potomac had fought its way, leaving a trail of blood for four weary
years, had at last succumbed to the overwhelming power of Grant's
indomitable armies.President Davis had received a despatch while attending services at St.Paul's church, Sunday morning, the 2d, advising him that the city must be
evacuated that night, and, leaving the church at once, he hastened the
preparations for flight with his personal papers and the archives of the
Confederate Government.During that Sabbath day and night Richmond was in
a state of riot.There had been an unwarranted feeling of security in the
city, and the unwelcome news, spreading like an electric flash, was
paralyzing and disastrous in its effect.Prisoners were released from
their toils, a lawless mob overran the thoroughfares, and civic government
was nullified.One explosion after another, on the morning of the 3d, rent
the air with deafening roar, as the magazines took fire.The scene was one
of terror and grandeur.The flames spread to the city from the ships, bridges, and arsenal, which
had been set on fire, and hundreds of buildings, including the best
residential section of the capital of the Confederacy, were destroyed.When the Union army entered the city in the morning, thousands of the
inhabitants, men, women, and children, were gathered at street corners and
in the parks, in wildest confusion.The commissary depot had been broken
open by the starving mob, and rifled of its contents, until the place was
reached by the spreading flames.The Federal soldiers stacked arms, and
heroically battled with the fire, drafting into the work all able-bodied
men found in the city.The invaders extinguished the flames, and soon
restored the city to a state of order and safety.The invalid wife of
General Lee, who was exposed to danger, was furnished with an ambulance
and corporal's guard until the danger was past.President Lincoln, who had visited Grant at Petersburg, entered Richmond
on the 4th of April.He visited President Davis' house, and Libby Prison,
then deserted, and held a conference with prominent citizens and army
officers of the Confederacy.The President seemed deeply concerned and
weighted down with the realization of the great responsibilities that
would fall upon him after the war.Only ten days later the nation was
shaken from ocean to ocean by the tragic news of his assassination.General Lee had started on his last march by eight o'clock on the night of
the 2d.By midnight the evacuation of both Petersburg and Richmond was
completed.For nine months the invincible forces of Lee had kept a foe of
more than twice their numerical strength from invading their stronghold,
and only after a long and harassing siege were they forced to retreat.They saw the burning city as their line of march was illuminated by the
conflagration, and emotions too deep for words overcame them.The woods
and fields, in their fresh, bright colors of spring, were in sharp
contrast to the travel-worn, weather-beaten, ragged veterans passing over
the verdant plain.Lee hastened the march of his troops to Amelia Court
House, where he had ordered supplies, but by mistake the train of supplies
had been sent on to Richmond.This was a crushing blow to the hungry men,
who had been stimulated on their tiresome march by the anticipation of
much-needed food.The fatality of war was now hovering over them like a
huge black specter.General Grant did not proceed to Richmond, but leaving General Weitzel to
invest the city, he hastened in pursuit of Lee to intercept the retreating
army.This pursuit was started early on the 3d.On the evening of that
date there was some firing between the pursuing army and Lee's rear guard.It was Lee's design to concentrate his force at Amelia Court House, but
this was not to be accomplished by the night of the 4th.Not until the 5th
was the whole army up, and then it was discovered that no adequate
supplies were within less than fifty miles.Subsistence could be obtained
only by foraging parties.No word of complaint from the suffering men
reached their commander, and on the evening of that disappointing day they
patiently and silently began the sad march anew.Their course was through
unfavorable territory and necessarily slow.The Federals were gaining upon
their retreating columns.Sheridan's cavalry had reached their flank, and
on the 6th there was heavy skirmishing.In the afternoon the Federals had
arrived in force sufficient to bring on an engagement with Ewell's corps
in the rear, at Sailor's Creek, a tributary of the Appomattox River.Ewell
was surrounded by the Federals and the entire corps captured.General
Anderson, commanding the divisions of Pickett and Johnson, was attacked
and fought bravely, losing many men.In all about six thousand Confederate
soldiers were left in the hands of the pursuing army.On the night of the 6th, the remainder of the Confederate army continued
the retreat and arrived at Farmville, where the men received two days'
rations, the first food except raw or parched corn that had been given
them for two days.Again the tedious journey was resumed, in the hope of
breaking through the rapidly-enmeshing net and forming a junction with
Johnston at Danville, or of gaining the protected region of the mountains
near Lynchburg.But the progress of the weak and weary marchers was slow
and the Federal cavalry had swept around to Lee's front, and a halt was
necessary to check the pursuing Federals.On the evening of the 8th, Lee
reached Appomattox Court House.Here ended the last march of the Army of
Northern Virginia.General Lee and his officers held a council of war on the night of the 8th
and it was decided to make an effort to cut their way through the Union
lines on the morning of the next day.On the 7th, while at Farmville, on
the south side of the Appomattox River, Grant sent to Lee a courteous
request for the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia, based on the
hopelessness of further resistance on the part of that army.In reply, Lee
expressed sympathy with Grant's desire to avoid useless effusion of blood
and asked the terms of surrender.The next morning General Grant replied to Lee, urging that a meeting be
designated by Lee, and specifying the terms of surrender, to which Lee
replied promptly, rejecting those terms, which were, that the Confederates
lay down their arms, and the men and officers be disqualified for taking
up arms against the Government of the United States until properly
exchanged.When Grant read Lee's letter he shook his head in
disappointment and said, "It looks as if Lee still means to fight; I will
reply in the morning."On the 9th Grant addressed another communication to Lee, repeating the
terms of surrender, and closed by saying, "The terms upon which peace can
be had are well understood.By the South laying down their arms they will
hasten that most desirable event, save thousands of human lives, and
hundreds of millions of property not yet destroyed.Sincerely hoping that
all our difficulties may be settled without the loss of another life, I
subscribe myself, etc."There remained for Lee the bare possibility, by desperate fighting, of
breaking through the Federal lines in his rear.To Gordon's corps was
assigned the task of advancing on Sheridan's strongly supported front.Since Pickett's charge at Gettysburg there had been no more hopeless
movement in the annals of the war.It was not merely that Gordon was
overwhelmingly outnumbered by the opposing forces, but his
hunger-enfeebled soldiers, even if successful in the first onslaught,
could count on no effective support, for Longstreet's corps was in even
worse condition than his own.Nevertheless, on the morning of Sunday, the
9th, the attempt was made.Gordon was fighting his corps, as he said, "to
a frazzle," when Lee came at last to a realizing sense of the futility of
it all and ordered a truce.A meeting with Grant was soon arranged on the
basis of the letters already exchanged.The conference of the two
world-famous commanders took place at Appomattox, a small settlement with
only one street, but to be made historic by this meeting.Lee was awaiting
Grant's arrival at the house of Wilmer McLean.It was here, surrounded by
staff-officers, that the terms were written by Grant for the final
surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia.The terms, and their
acceptance, were embodied in the following letters, written and signed in
the famous "brick house" on that memorable Sunday:

    APPOMATTOX COURT HOUSE, VIRGINIA,
    APRIL 9, 1865.GENERAL: In accordance with the substance of my letter to you of the
    8th instant, I propose to receive the surrender of the Army of
    Northern Virginia on the following terms, to wit: Rolls of all the
    officers and men to be made in duplicate, one copy to be given to an
    officer to be designated by me, the other to be retained by such
    officer or officers as you may designate.The officers to give their
    individual paroles not to take up arms against the Government of the
    United States until properly exchanged; and each company or regimental
    commander to sign a like parole for the men of their commands.The
    arms, artillery, and public property to be parked and stacked, and
    turned over to the officers appointed by me to receive them.This will
    not embrace the side-arms of the officers, nor their private horses or
    baggage.This done, each officer and man will be allowed to return to
    his home, not to be disturbed by the United States authority so long
    as they observe their paroles and the laws in force where they may
    reside.U. S. GRANT, _Lieutenant-General_.HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,
    APRIL 9, 1865.GENERAL: I have received your letter of this date containing the terms
    of the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia as proposed by you.As they are substantially the same as those expressed in your letter
    of the 8th instant, they are accepted.I will proceed to designate the
    proper officers to carry the stipulation into effect.R. E. LEE, _General_.Lieutenant-General U. S. Grant.When Federal officers were seen galloping toward the Union lines from
Appomattox Court House it was quickly surmised that Lee had surrendered.Cheer after cheer was sent up by the long lines throughout their entire
length; caps and tattered colors were waved in the air.Officers and men
alike joined in the enthusiastic outburst.It was glad tidings, indeed, to
these men, who had fought and hoped and suffered through the long bloody
years.When Grant returned to his headquarters and heard salutes being fired he
ordered it stopped at once, saying, "The war is over; the rebels are our
countrymen again; and the best sign of rejoicing after the victory will be
to abstain from all demonstration in the field."Details of the surrender were arranged on the next day by staff-officers
of the respective armies.The parole officers were instructed by General
Grant to permit the Confederate soldiers to retain their own horses--a
concession that was most welcome to many of the men, who had with them
animals brought from the home farm early in the war.There were only twenty-eight thousand men to be paroled, and of these
fewer than one-third were actually bearing arms on the day of the
surrender.The Confederate losses of the last ten days of fighting
probably exceeded ten thousand.The Confederate supplies had been captured by Sheridan, and Lee's army was
almost at the point of starvation.An order from Grant caused the rations
of the Federal soldiers to be shared with the "Johnnies," and the
victorious "Yanks" were only too glad to tender such hospitality as was
within their power.These acts of kindness were slight in themselves, but
they helped immeasurably to restore good feeling and to associate for all
time with Appomattox the memory of reunion rather than of strife.The
things that were done there can never be the cause of shame to any
American.The noble and dignified bearing of the commanders was an example
to their armies and to the world that quickly had its effect in the
genuine reconciliation that followed.The scene between Lee and his devoted army was profoundly touching.General Long in his "Memoirs of Lee" says: "It is impossible to describe
the anguish of the troops when it was known that the surrender of the army
was inevitable.Of all their trials, this was the greatest and hardest to
endure."As Lee rode along the lines of the tried and faithful men who had
been with him at the Wilderness, at Spotsylvania, and at Cold Harbor, it
was not strange that those ragged, weather-beaten heroes were moved by
deep emotion and that tears streamed down their bronzed and scarred faces.Their general in broken accents admonished them to go to their homes and
be as brave citizens as they had been soldiers.Thus ended the greatest civil war in history, for soon after the fall of
the Confederate capital and the surrender of Lee's army, there followed in
quick succession the surrender of all the remaining Southern forces.While these stirring events were taking place in Virginia, Sherman, who
had swept up through the Carolinas with the same dramatic brilliancy that
marked his march to the sea, accomplishing most effective work against
Johnston, was at Goldsboro.When Johnston learned of the fall of Richmond
and Lee's surrender he knew the end had come and he soon arranged for the
surrender of his army on the terms agreed upon at Appomattox.In the first
week of May General "Dick" Taylor surrendered his command near Mobile, and
on the 10th of the same month, President Jefferson Davis, who had been for
nearly six weeks a fugitive, was overtaken and made a prisoner near
Irwinsville, Georgia.The Southern Confederacy was a thing of the past.[Illustration: MEN ABOUT TO WITNESS APPOMATTOX

No photographer was present at Appomattox, that supreme moment in our
national history, when Americans met for the last time as foes on the
field.Nothing but fanciful sketches exist of the scene inside the McLean
home.But here is a photograph that shows most of the Union officers
present at the conference.Nine of the twelve men standing above stood
also at the signing of Lee's surrender, a few days later.The scene is
City Point, in March, 1865.Grant is surrounded by a group of the officers
who had served him so faithfully.At the surrender, it was Colonel T. S.
Bowers (third from left) upon whom Grant called to make a copy of the
terms of surrender in ink.Colonel E. S. Parker, the full-blooded Indian
on Grant's staff, an excellent penman, wrote out the final copy.Nineteen
years later, General Horace Porter recorded with pride that he loaned
General Lee a pencil to make a correction in the terms.Colonels William
Duff and J. D. Webster, and General M. R. Patrick, are the three men who
were not present at the interview.All of the remaining officers were
formally presented to Lee.General Seth Williams had been Lee's adjutant
when the latter was superintendent at West Point some years before the
war.In the lower photograph General Grant stands between General Rawlins
and Colonel Bowers.The veins standing out on the back of his hand are
plainly visible.No one but he could have told how calmly the blood
coursed through them during the four tremendous years.[Illustration: GRANT BETWEEN RAWLINS AND BOWERS]


[Illustration: IN PETERSBURG--AFTER NINE MONTHS OF BATTERING

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]This fine mansion on Bolingbroke Street, the residential section of
Petersburg, has now, on the 3d of April, fallen into the hands of
straggling Union soldiers.Its windows have long since been shattered by
shells from distant Federal mortars; one has even burst through the wall.But it was not till the night of April 2d, when the retreat of the
Confederate forces started, that the citizens began to leave their homes.At 9 o'clock in the morning General Grant, surrounded by his staff, rode
quietly into the city.At length they arrived
at a comfortable home standing back in a yard.There he dismounted and sat
for a while on the piazza.Soon a group of curious citizens gathered on
the sidewalk to gaze at the commander of the Yankee armies.But the Union
troops did not remain long in the deserted homes.Sheridan was already in
pursuit south of the Appomattox, and Grant, after a short conference with
Lincoln, rode to the west in the rear of the hastily marching troops.Bolingbroke Street and Petersburg soon returned to the ordinary
occupations of peace in an effort to repair the ravages of the historic
nine months' siege.[Illustration: APPOMATTOX STATION--LEE'S LAST ATTEMPT TO PROVISION HIS

provision train arrived on the morning of April 8th.The supplies were
being loaded into wagons and ambulances by a detail of about four thousand

upon them, having reached the spot by a by-road leading from the Red
House.After a few shots the Confederates fled in confusion.The cavalry
drove them on in the direction of Appomattox Court House, capturing many
prisoners, twenty-five pieces of artillery, a hospital train, and a large
pack of wagons.This was Lee's last effort to obtain food for his army.[Illustration: FEDERAL SOLDIERS WHO PERFORMED ONE OF THE LAST DUTIES AT

The sad significance of these photographs is all too apparent.Not only
the bank buildings were in ruins, but the financial system of the entire
South.All available capital had been consumed by the demands of the war,
and a system of paper currency had destroyed credit completely.Worse
still was the demoralization of all industry.Through large areas of the
South all mills and factories were reduced to ashes, and everywhere the
industrial system was turned topsy-turvy.Truly the problem that
confronted the South was stupendous.[Illustration: WRECK OF THE GALLEGO FLOUR MILLS

captured in the defenses about Richmond are parked near the wharves on the
James River ready for shipment to the national arsenal at Washington, once
more the capital of a united country.The reflection of these instruments
of destruction on the peaceful surface of the canal is not more clear than
was the purpose of the South to accept the issues of the war and to
restore as far as in them lay the bases for an enduring prosperity.The
same devotion which manned these guns so bravely and prolonged the contest
as long as it was possible for human powers to endure, was now directed to
the new problems which the cessation of hostilities had provided.The
restored Union came with the years to possess for the South a significance
to be measured only by the thankfulness that the outcome had been what it
was and by the pride in the common traditions and common blood of the
whole American people.These captured guns are a memory therefore, not of
regret, but of recognition, gratitude, that the highest earthly tribunal
settled all strife in 1865.[Illustration: COEHORNS, MORTARS, LIGHT AND HEAVY GUNS]


[Illustration: LINCOLN THE LAST SITTING--ON THE DAY OF LEE'S SURRENDER

COPYRIGHT, 1911, REVIEW OF REVIEWS CO.]On April 9, 1865, the very day of the surrender of Lee at Appomattox,
Lincoln, for the last time, went to the photographer's gallery.As he sits
in simple fashion sharpening his pencil, the man of sorrows cannot forget
the sense of weariness and pain that for four years has been unbroken.No
elation of triumph lights the features.One task is ended--the Nation is
saved.But another, scarcely less exacting, confronts him.The States
which lay "out of their proper practical relation to the Union," in his
own phrase, must be brought back into a proper practical relation.Only five days later the sad eyes reflected
upon this page closed forever upon scenes of earthly turmoil.Bereft of
Lincoln's heart and head, leaders attacked problems of reconstruction in
ways that proved unwise.As the mists of passion and prejudice cleared
away, both North and South came to feel that this patient, wise, and
sympathetic ruler was one of the few really great men in history, and that
he would live forever in the hearts of men made better by his presence
during those four years of storm.[Illustration: THE RETURN OF THE SOLDIERS--THE GRAND REVIEW

COPYRIGHT, 1911, PATRIOT PUB.One of the proudest days of the nation--May 24, 1865--here lives again.The true greatness of the American people was not displayed till the close
of the war.The citizen from the walks of humble life had during the
contest become a veteran soldier, equal in courage and fighting capacity
to the best drilled infantry of Marlborough, Frederick the Great, or
Napoleon.But it remained to be seen whether he would return peacefully to
the occupations of peace."Would
nearly a million men," they asked, "one of the mightiest military
organizations ever trained in war, quietly lay aside this resistless power
and disappear into the unnoted walks of civil life?"The disbanded veterans
lent the effectiveness of military order and discipline to the industrial
and commercial development of the land they had come to love with an
increased devotion.The pictures are of Sherman's troops marching down
Pennsylvania Avenue.The horsemen in the lead are General Francis P. Blair
and his staff, and the infantry in flashing new uniforms are part of the
Seventeenth Corps in the Army of Tennessee.Little over a year before,
they had started with Sherman on his series of battles and flanking
marches in the struggle for Atlanta.They had taken a conspicuous and
important part in the battle of July 22d east of Atlanta, receiving and
finally repulsing attacks in both front and rear.They had marched with
Sherman to the sea and participated in the capture of Savannah.They had
joined in the campaign through the Carolinas, part of the time leading the
advance and tearing up many miles of railway track, and operating on the
extreme right after the battle of Bentonville.After the negotiations for
Johnston's surrender were completed in April, they set out on the march
for the last time with flying colors and martial music, to enter the
memorable review at Washington in May, here preserved.[Illustration: THE SAME SCENE, A FEW SECONDS LATER

  Islington, May 15._Athelney._--In a visit which I recently paid to the field of
_Sedgemoor_ and the Isle of _Athelney_ in Somersetshire, I found on the
latter a stone pillar, inclosed by an iron railing, designed to point
the traveller's eye to the spot, so closely associated with his earliest
historical studies, with the burnt cakes, the angry housewife, and the
castigated king.The pillar bears the following inscription, which you
may think perhaps worthy of preservation in your useful pages:--

  "King Alfred the Great, in the year of our Lord 879, having been
  defeated by the Danes, fled for refuge to the forest of Athelney,
  where he lay concealed from his enemies for the space of a whole
  year.He soon after regained possession of his throne, and in
  grateful remembrance of the protection he had received, under the
  favour of Heaven, he erected a monastery on this spot and endowed
  it with all the lands contained in the Isle of Athelney.To
  perpetuate the memorial of so remarkable an incident in the life
  of that illustrious prince, this edifice was founded by John
  Slade, Esq., of Mansell, the proprietor of Athelney and Lord of
  the Manor of North Petherton, A. D.J. R. W.

Treasury_?[Bogatzky was a Polish nobleman, the pupil of the great Professor
  Francke, and of a kindred spirit.He died at an advanced age in
  1768.It is not generally known that Bogatzky published a Second
  Volume of his _Golden Treasury_, which Dr.Steinkopff revised and
  edited in 1812, to which he prefixed a short but interesting
  account of the author.See also _Allgemeine Enyclopaedie von Ersch
  und Gruber_, s.v.]GREENE'S "GROATSWORTH OF WITTE."HALLIWELL's Query, "whether the remarkable passage
respecting Shakspeare in this work has descended to us in its genuine
state," I beg to inform him that I possess a copy of the edition of
1596, as well as of those of 1617 and 1621, from the latter of which the
reprint by Sir Egerton Brydges was taken, and that the passage in
question is exactly the same in all the three editions.For the general
information of your readers interested in Greene's works, I beg to
state, that the variations in the edition of 1596 from the other two,
consist of the words "written before his death, and published at his
dying request," on the title; and instead of the introductory address
"To Wittie Poets, or Poeticall Wittes," signed I. H., there are a few
lines on A 2, "The Printer to the Gentle Readers:"

  "I haue published heere, Gentlemen, for your mirth and benefit,
  Greene's Groateswoorth of Wit.With sundry of his pleasant
  discourses ye haue beene before delighted: But now hath death
  giuen a period to his pen, onely this happened into my hands which
  I haue published for your pleasures: Accept it fauourably because
  it was his last birth, and not least worth, in my poore opinion.But I will cease to praise that which is aboue my conceit, and
  leaue it selfe to speake for it selfe: and so abide your learned
  censuring.Then follows another short address, "To the Gentlemen Readers," by
Greene himself; and as this edition is so rare, only two copies being
known, and the address is short, I transcribe it entire for your
insertion:

  "Gentlemen, The Swan sings melodiously before death, that in all
  his life time vseth but a iarring sound._Greene_, though able
  inough to write, yet deeplyer searched with sicknesse than euer
  heretofore, sendes you his swanne-like song, for that he feares he
  shall neuer againe carroll to you woonted loue layes, neuer againe
  discouer to you youth's pleasures.Howeuer yet sicknesse, riot,
  incontinence, haue at once shown their extremitie, yet if I
  recouer, you shall all see more fresh springs then euer sprang
  from me, directing you how to liue, yet not diswading you from
  loue.This is the last I haue writ, and I feare me the last I
  shall write.And how euer I haue beene censured for some of my
  former bookes, yet, Gentlemen, I protest, they were as I had
  special information.But passing them, I commend this to your
  fauourable censures, and like an Embrion without shape, I feare me
  will bee thrust into the world.If I liue to ende it, it shall be
  otherwise: if not, yet will I commend it to your courtesies, that
  you may as wel be acquainted with my repentant death, as you haue
  lamented my carelesse course of life.But as _Nemo ante obitum
  felix_, so _Acta exitus probat_: Beseeching therefore to bee
  deemed hereof as I deserue, I leaue the worke to your liking, and
  leaue you to your delights."Greene died in September, 1592; and this is curious, as being probably
the last thing that ever came from his pen.A 4, the other three leaves being occupied
with the title and the two addresses.It concludes with Greene's "letter
written to his wife," and has not "Greene's Epitaph: Discoursed
Dialogue-wise betweene Life and Death," which is in the two later
editions.I may here mention that I possess a copy of an extremely rare work
relating to Robert Greene, which has only lately become known, viz.:

  "Greene's Newes both from Heaven and Hell.Prohibited the first
  for writing of Bookes, and banished out of the last for displaying
  of Connycatchers.(Barnabee
  Rich) 4to.Concerning the great rarity of this interesting tract, which was unknown
to the Rev.A. Dyce when publishing his edition of Greene's works, your
readers may see a notice by Mr.Collier in his _Extracts from the
Registry of the Stat.233., apparently from the
present copy, no other being known.Besides the copy of the above work mentioned by your correspondent J. H.
T., several others are known to exist in this country.Among them I may
mention one in the library of the Baptist College, Bristol.My own copy
was supplied by a London bookseller, who has likewise imported several
other copies from Holland, where it is by no means a scarce work.The second illustrated edition was published twenty years after the
decease of Van Braght.The first edition, without engravings, now before
me, appeared in 1660, which was the edition used by Danvers.But Danvers
does not appear to have known its existence, when the first edition of
his treatise came out in 1673.The "large additions" of his second
edition in 1674, are chiefly made from the work of Van Braght.The original portion of Van Braght's work is, however, confined to the
first part.The second part, _The Martyrology_, strictly so called, is
of much earlier date.Many single narratives appeared at the time, and
collections of these were early made.The earliest collection of
martyrdoms bears the date of 1542.This was enlarged in 1562, 1578,
1580, and 1595.This fact I give on the authority of Professor Mueller of
Amsterdam, from the _Jaarboekje voor de Doopsgezinde Gemeenten in de
Nederlanden, 1838 en 1839_, pp.An edition, dated 1599, of these very rare books is now before me.It
has the following curious and affecting title:

  "Dit Boeck wort genaemt: Het Offer des Heeren, Om het inhout van
  sommige opgeofferde Kinderen Gods, de welcke voort gebrocht
  hebben, wt den goeden schat haers herten, Belijdinghen,
  Sentbrieuen ende Testamenten, de welcke sy met den monde beleden,
  ende met den bloede bezeghelt hebben, &c.By
  my Peter Sebastiaenzoon, Int jaer ons Heeren MDXCIX."of 229 folios, and contains the martyrdoms of
thirty-three persons (the first of which is Stephen), which were
subsequently embodied in the larger martyrologies.Each narrative is
followed by a versified version of it.A small book of hymns is added,
some of them composed by the martyrs; and the letters and confession of
one Joos de Tollenaer, who was put to death at Ghent in 1589.In 1615, a large collection of these narratives appeared at Haarlem in a
thick 4to.The compilers were Hans de Ries, Jaques Outerman, and
Joost Govertsoon, all eminent Mennonite ministers.Two editions followed
from the press of Zacharias Cornelis at Hoorn in 1617 and 1626, both in
4to., but under different editorship.The last edition was offensive to
the Haarlem editors, who therefore published a fourth at Haarlem in
1631.As its title is brief, I will give it from the copy in my library:

  "Martelaers Spiegel der Werelose Christenen t' zedert A. D.Gedrukt tot Haarlem Bij Hans
  Passchiers van Wesbusch.In't Jaer onses Heeren, 1631."The title-page is from a copperplate,
and is adorned with eight small engravings, representing scenes of
suffering and persecution from scripture.The narratives of martyrs
extends from 1524 to 1624.It is this work which forms the basis of Van
Braght's.He added to it the whole of his first part, and also some
additional narratives in the second.To the best of his ability he
verified the whole.These works are frequently referred to by Ottius in his _Annales
Anabaptistici_ under the titles "Martyrologium Harlemense" and
"Martyrologium Hornanum."From a paper in the _Archivs fuer Kunde oesterreichischer
Geschichtsquellen_, I learn that a MS.exists in the City library of
Hamburgh, with the following title:

  "Chronickel oder Denkbueechel darinnen mit kurtzen Begriffen, Was
  sich vom 1524 Jar, Bis auff gegenwaertige Zeit, in der gemain
  zuegetragen, vnd wie viel trewer Zeugen Jesu Christij die warheit
  Gottes so riterlich mit irem bluet bezeugt.The work appears chiefly confined to a history of the Moravian
Anabaptists: but from passages given by the writer, Herr Gregor Wolny,
it is evident that it contains many of the narratives given by Van
Braght.was written previous to 1592,
when its writer or compiler died.Three continuators carried on the
narrations to 1654.The last date in it is June 7, 1654; when Daniel
Zwicker, in his own handwriting, records his settlement as pastor over a
Baptist church.by Ottius, and by Fischer in
his _Tauben-kobel_, p.33., &c. For any additional particulars
respecting it, I should feel greatly obliged.It does not appear to be known to your correspondent that a translation
of the second part of Van Braght's work has been commenced in this
country, of which the first volume was issued by the Hanserd Knollys
Society last year.A translation of the entire work appeared in 1837, in
Pennsylvania, U. S., for the use of the Mennonite churches, emigrants
from Holland and Germany to whom the language of their native land had
become a strange tongue._Spick and Span New_ (Vol.).--The corresponding _German_
word is _Spann-nagel-neu_, which may be translated as "New from the
stretching needle;" and corroborates the meaning given by you.I may
remark the French have no equivalent phrase.It is evidently a familiar
allusion of the clothmakers of England and Germany.).--There is an old Club in this
town (Birmingham) called the "Bear Club," and established (ut dic.)circa 1738, formerly of some repute.Among other legends of the Club, is
one, that in the centre of the ceiling of their dining-room was once a
carved rose, and that the members always drank as a first toast, to "The
health of the King," [under the rose], meaning the Pretender._Handel's Occasional Oratorio_ (Vol.).--The "Occasional
Oratorio" is a separate composition, containing an overture, 10
recitatives, 21 airs, 1 duet, and 15 choruses.It was produced in the
year 1745.It is reported, I know not on what authority, that the King
having ordered Handel to produce a new oratorio on a given day, and the
artist having answered that it was impossible to do it in the time
(which must have been unreasonably short, to extort such a reply from
the intellect that produced _The Messiah_ in three weeks, and _Israel in
Egypt_ in four), his Majesty deigned no other answer than that done it
must and should be, whether possible or not, and that the result was the
putting forward of the "Occasional Oratorio."The structure of the oratorio, which was evidently a very hurried
composition, gives a strong air of probability to the anecdote.Evidently no libretto was written for it; the words tell no tale, are
totally unconnected, and not even always tolerable English, a fine
chorus (p.Arnold) going to the words "Him or his God we no fear."It is rather a collection of sacred pieces, strung together literally
without rhyme or reason in the oratorio form, than one oratorio.The
examination of it leads one to the conclusion, that the composer took
from his portfolio such pieces as he happened to have at hand, strung
them together as he best could, and made up the necessary quantity by
selections from his other works.Accordingly we find in it the pieces
"The Horse and his Rider," "Thou shalt bring them in," "Who is like unto
Thee?""The Hailstone Chorus," "The Enemy said I will pursue," from
_Israel in Egypt_, written in 1738; the chorus "May God from whom all
Mercies spring," from _Athaliah_ (1733); and the chorus "God save the
King, long live the King," from the _Coronation Anthem_ of 1727.Liberty," which he afterwards (in 1746) employed in
_Judas Maccabaeus_.Possibly some other pieces of this oratorio may be
found also in some of Handel's other works, not sufficiently stamped on
my memory for me to recognise them; but I may remark that the quantity
of _Israel in Egypt_ found in it may perhaps have so connected it in
some minds with that glorious composition as to have led to the practice
referred to of prefixing in performance the overture to the latter work,
to which, although the introductory movement, the fine adagio, and grand
march are fit enough, the light character of the fugue is, it must be
confessed, singularly inappropriate.Sandra moved to the bedroom.I am not aware of any other "occasion" than that of the King's will,
which led to the composition of this oratorio.).--They are found in the ancient
churches in Ireland, and some are preserved in the Museum of the Royal
Irish Academy, and in private collections.A beautiful specimen is
engraved in Wakeman's _Handbook of Irish Antiquities_, p.).--The charge for a
"Thanksgiving Book," mentioned by A CHURCHWARDEN, was no doubt for a
Book of Prayers, &c., on some general thanksgiving day, probably after
the battle of Blenheim and the taking of Gibraltar, which would be about
the month of November.A similar charge appears in the Churchwardens'
accounts for the parish of _Eye, Suffolk_, at a much earlier period,
viz.1684, which you may probably deem worthy of insertion in your
pages:

    J. B. COLMAN._Carved Ceiling in Dorsetshire_ (Vol.).--Philip, King of
Castile (father to Charles V.), was forced by foul weather into Weymouth
Harbour.He was hospitably entertained by Sir Thomas Trenchard, who
invited Mr.King Philip took
such delight in his company that at his departure he recommended him to
King Henry VII.as a person of spirit "fit to stand before princes, and
not before mean men."He died in 1554, and was the ancestor of the
Bedford family.Sir Thomas Trenchard probably had the ceiling.See
Fuller's _Worthies_ (_Dorsetshire_), vol.The house of which your correspondent has heard his tradition is
certainly _Woolverton House_, in the parish of Charminster, near this
town.It was built by Sir Thomas Trenchard, who died 20 Hen.; and
tradition holds, as history tells us, that Phillip, Archduke of Austria,
and King of Castile, with his queen _Juana_, or _Joanna_, were driven by
weather into the port of Weymouth: and that Sir Thomas Trenchard, then
the High Sheriff of the county, invited their majesties to his house,
and afforded them entertainment that was no less gratifying than timely.Woolverton now belongs to James Henning, Esq.There is some fine carving
in the house, though it is not the ceiling that is markworthy; and it is
thought by some to be the work of a foreign hand.At Woolverton House
were founded the high fortunes of the House of Bedford.Sir Thomas
Trenchard, feeling the need of an interpreter with their Spanish
Majesties, happily bethought himself of a John Russell, Esq., of
Berwick, who had lived some years in Spain, and spoke Castilian; and
invited him, as a Spanish-English mouth, to his house: and it is said he
accompanied the king and queen to London, where he was recommended to
the favour of Hen.; and after rising to high office, received from
Hen.See Hutchins's _History of Dorset_._"Felix quem faciunt," &c._ (Vol.).--The passage
cited by C. H. P. as assigned to Plautus, and which he says he cannot
find in that author, occurs in one of the interpolated scenes in the
_Mercator_, which are placed in some of the old editions between the 5th
and 6th Scenes of Act IV.In the edition by Pareus, printed at Neustadt
(Neapolis Nemetum) in 1619, 4to., it stands thus:

  "Verum id dictum est: Feliciter is sapit, qui periculo alieno
  sapit."I was wrong in attributing it to Plautus, and should rather have called
it _Plautine_.By a strange slip of the pen or the press, pericu_lum_ is
put instead of pericu_lo_ in my note.Niebuhr has a very interesting
essay on the interpolated scenes in Plautus, in the first volume of his
_Kleine Historische und Philologische Schriften_, which will show why
these scenes and passages, marked as supposititious in some editions,
are now omitted.It appears that they were made in the fifteenth century
by Hermolaus Barbarus.See a letter from him to the Bishop of Segni, in
_Angeli Politiani Epistolae_, lib.To the parallel thoughts already cited may be added the following:

  "Ii qui sciunt, quid aliis acciderit, facile ex aliorum eventu,
  suis rationibus possunt providere.""I' presi esempio de' lor stati rei,
      Facendomi profitto l' altrui male
      In consolar i casi e dolor miei."Petrarca, _Trionfo della Castita_."Ben' e felice quel, donne mie care,
      Ch' essere accorto all' altrui spese impare."Fur._, canto X.

    S. W. SINGER.G. STEPHENS
states, that Mons.Roquefort's nine columns are decisive of Saint Graal
being derived from Sancta Cratera.I am unacquainted with the word
_cratera_, unless in Ducange, as meaning a basket.But _crater_, a
goblet, is the word meant by Roquefort.How should _graal_ or _greal_ come from _crater_?Surely that ancient writer, nearly, or quite, contemporary
with the publication of the romance, Helinandus Frigidimontanus, may be
trusted for the fact that _graal_ was French for "gradalis or gradale,"
which meant "scutella lata et aliquantulum profunda in qua preciosae
dapes cum suo jure divitibus solent apponi."Vincentium Bellovacensem, _Speculum Historiale_, lib.Can
there be a more apparent and palpable etymology of any word, than that
_graal_ is _gradale_?See Ducange in _Gradale_, No.3, and in
_Gradalis_, and the three authorities (of which Helinand is not one)
cited by him._Skeletons at Egyptian Banquet_ (Vol.).--The
_interpretation_ of this is probably from Jer.See,
for the history of the association in his mind, his sermon on the
"Marriage Ring.""It is fit that I should infuse a bunch of myrrh into the festival
  goblet, and, after the Egyptian manner, serve up a dead man's
  bones as a feast.").--Allow me to refer H. C. K. to a passage
in the _Letters on the Suppression of the Monasteries_, published by the
Camden Society, p.71., for an example of the word _sewelles_.It is
there said to be equivalent to _blawnsherres_.The scattered pages of
Duns Scotus were put to this use, after he was banished from Oxford by
the Royal Commissioners.The word is perhaps akin to the low Latin _suellium_, threshing-floor,
or to the Norman French _swele_, threshold: in which case the original
meaning would be _bounds_ or _limits_.).--This word is a Latinised form of the
Irish words Cul-{f}eabu{s} (cul-feabus), _i.e._ "a closet of decency"
or "for the sake of decency."_Poem from the Digby MS._ (Vol.).--Your correspondent H.
A. B. will find the lines in his MS.beginning

      "You worms, my rivals," &c.,

printed, with very slight variations, amongst Beaumont's poems, in
Moxon's edition of the Works of Beaumont and Fletcher, 1840.They are
the concluding lines of "An Elegy on the Lady Markham."W. J. BERNHARD SMITH.).--I find the following passage in
the fourth edition of Blount's _Glossographia_, published as far back as
1674."_Umbrello_ (Ital._Ombrella_), a fashion of round and broad Fans,
  wherewith the _Indians_ (and from them our great ones) preserve
  themselves from the heat of the sun or fire; and hence any little
  shadow, Fan, or other thing, wherewith the women guard their faces
  from the sun."In Kersey's _Dictionarium Anglo-Britannicum_, 1708, it is thus noticed--

  "_Umbrella_, or _Umbrello_, a kind of broad Fan or Skreen,
  commonly us'd by women to shelter them from Rain: also a Wooden
  Frame cover'd with cloth to keep off the sun from a window.")_, a small sort of canopy or umbrello, which women
  carry over their heads."And in Phillips's _New World of Words_, 7th ed., 1720--

  "_Umbrella_ or _Umbrello_, a kind of broad Fan or Skreen, which in
  hot countries People hold over their heads to keep off the Heat
  of the Sun; or such as are here commonly us'd by women to shelter
  them from Rain: Also, a wooden Frame cover'd with cloth or stuff,
  to keep off the sun from a window.")_, a small sort of canopy or umbrello, which women
  carry over their Heads, to shelter themselves from Rain," &c.

    T. C. T.).--Your correspondent L.
says, the true explanation of the circumstance of the nine of diamonds
being called the curse of Scotland is to be found in the game of Pope
Joan; but with all due deference to him, I must beg entirely to dissent
from this opinion, and to adhere to the notion of its origin being
traceable to the heraldic bearing of the family of Dalrymple, which are
or, on a saltire azure, _nine lozenges of the field_.There can be no doubt that John Dalrymple, 2nd Viscount and 1st Earl of
Stair, justly merited the appellation of the "Curse of Scotland," from
the part which he took in the horrible massacre of Glencoe, and from the
utter detestation in which he was held in consequence, and which
compelled him to resign the secretaryship in 1695.After a deliberate
inquiry by the commissioners had declared _him_ to be guilty of the
massacre, we cannot wonder that the man should be held up to scorn by
the most popular means which presented themselves; and the nine diamonds
in his shield would very naturally, being the insignia of his family, be
the best and most easily understood mode of perpetuating that
detestation in the minds of the people.).--Your
correspondents will find some information on this word in Ledwich's
_Antiquities of Ireland_, 2nd edit.279.; and in Wakeman's _Handbook
of Irish Antiquities_, p.Ledwich seems to derive the word from the
Teutonic _Bawen_, to construct and secure with branches of trees._Catacombs and Bone-houses_ (Vol.GATTY will find a
vivid description of the bone-house at Hythe, in Mr.Borrow's
_Lavengro_, vol.i. I have no reference to the exact page._Bacon and Fagan_ (Vol.).--The letters B and F are
doubtless convertible, as they are both labial letters, and can be
changed as _b_ and _p_ are so frequently.The word "batten" is used by Milton in the same sense as the word
"fatten."The Latin word "flo" is in English "to blow."The word "flush" means much the same as "blush."The Greek word [Greek: bremo] is in the Latin changed to "fremo."The Greek word [Greek: bora] = in English "forage."[Greek: Bilippos] for [Greek: Philippos]; [Greek:
Bryges] for [Greek: Phryges].[Greek: Phalaina] in Greek = "balaena" in Latin = "balene" in French.[Greek: Phero] in Greek = "to bear" in English."Frater" in Latin = "brother" in English.I think that we may fairly imply that the labials _p_, _b_, _f_, _v_,
may be interchanged, in the same way as the dental letters _d_ and _t_
are constantly; and I see no reason left to doubt that the word Bacon is
the same as the word Fagan.).--When A SUBSCRIBER TO YOUR
JOURNAL asks for some account of the origin of the phrase "to learn by
Heart," may he not find it in St."To learn by _memory_" (or by "_rote_") conveys to my own mind a very
different notion from what I conceive to be expressed by the words "To
learn by _heart_."Just as there is an evident difference between a
_gentleman in heart and feeling_, and a _gentleman in manners and
education only_; so there is a like difference (as I conceive) between
learning by heart and learning by rote; namely, the difference between a
_moral_, and a merely _intellectual_, operation of the mind.To learn by
_memory_ is to learn by _rote_, as a parrot: to learn by _heart_ is to
learn _morally--practically_.Thus, we say, we give our hearts to our
pursuits: we "love God with all our hearts," pray to Him "with the
spirit, and with the understanding," and "with the heart believe unto
righteousness:" we "ponder in our hearts," "muse in our hearts," and
"keep things in our hearts," i. e.).--Claudius Minois, in his Commentaries on
the _Emblemata_ of Alciatus, gives the following etymology of
"Auriga:"--

  "Auriga non dicitur ab auro, sed ab aureis: sunt enim aureae lora
  sive fraeni, qui equis ad aures alligantur; sicut oreae, quibus ora
  coercentur."--_Alciati Emblemata_, Emb.W. R.

  Hospitio Chelhamensi._Vineyards in England_ (Vol.).--Add to
the others _Wynyard_, so far north as Durham.Barker lived in West Square, St.George's Fields, a square directly opposite the Philanthropic Society's
chapel._Barker, the original Panorama Painter._--MR.CUNNINGHAM is quite
correct in stating Robert Barker to be the originator of the Panorama.His first work of the kind was a view of Edinburgh, of which city, I
believe, he was a native.On his death, in 1806, he was succeeded by his son, Mr.Henry Aston
Barker, the Mr.Barker referred to by A. G. This gentleman and his wife
(one of the daughters of the late Admiral Bligh) are both living, and
reside at Bitton, a village lying midway between this city and Bath.Bristol, June 2, 1851.).--ARUN's Query is fully
answered by a reference to Mrs.Jameson's _Sacred and Legendary Art_,
vol.379., where the bell is shown to be emblematic of the
saint's power to exorcise evil spirits, and reference is made to several
paintings (and an engraving given of one) in which it is represented.The phrase "A Tantony Pig" is also explained, for which see further
Halliwell's _Dict._Essay on the Irony of Sophocles, &c._ (Vol.).--Three

istis vera sentire_; (again), Cicero, _ad Attic._, l. viii.7.:--_Malle_, quod dixerim, me _cum Pompeio vinci, quam cum istis

Homer by Plato himself:

  "Aristot.is
  reluctant to criticise Plato's doctrine of _Ideas_, [Greek: dia to
  philous andras eisagagein ta eide]: but, he adds, the truth must
  nevertheless be spoken:--[Greek: amphoin gar ontoin philoin,
  hosion protiman ten aletheian.]"Plato [_de Repub._, X. cap.]:--[Greek: Philia tis me
  kai aidos ek paidos echousa peri Homerou apokolyei legein... all'
  ou gar pro ge tes aletheias timeteos aner.]"_Achilles and the Tortoise_ (Vol.T. Coleridge has
explained this paradox in _The Friend_, vol.1850: a
note is subjoined regarding Aristotle's attempted solution, with a
quotation from Mr.de Quincey, in _Tate's Mag._, Sept.The
passage in _Leibnitz_ which [Greek: Idihotes] requires, is probably
"_Opera_, i. p._Early Rain called "Pride of the Morning"_ (Vol.).--In
connexion with this I would quote an expression in Keble's _Christian
Year_, "On the Rainbow," (25th Sun.):

      "_Pride of the_ dewy _Morning_!The swain's experienced eye
      From thee takes timely warning,
        Nor trusts else the gorgeous sky.").--JARLTZBERG will find one theory
on this subject in Dr.Asahel Grant's book, _The Nestorians; or, the
Lost Tribes_, published by Murray; 12mo."_Noli me Tangere_" (Vol.).--There is an
exquisite criticism upon the treatment of this subject by various
painters, accompanied by an etching from Titian, in that delightful
book, Mrs.Jameson's _Sacred and Legendary Art_, vol.360.;
and to the list of painters who have illustrated this subject, add
_Holbein_, in the Hampton Court Gallery.Jameson's _Handbook
to the Public Galleries_, pp."_The Sicilian Vespers_" (Vol.).--Your correspondent is
referred to _The War of the Sicilian Vespers_, by Amari, translated by
the Earl of Ellesmere, published very lately by Murray._Antiquity of Smoking_ (Vol ii., pp.B. says, alluding to
JARLTZBERG's references, "there is nothing in Solinus;" I read, however,
in Solinus, cap.1518), under the heading,
"Thracum mores, etc.":

  "Uterque sexus epulantes focos ambiunt, herbarum quas habent
  semine ignibus superjecto.Cujus nidore perculsi pro laetitia
  habent imitari ebrietatem sensibus sauciatis."JARLTZBERG's reference to Herod.36. supplies nothing to the point:
Herod.2. mentions the use of bone pipes, [Greek: physeteras
osteinous], by the Scythians, _in milking_; but Herodotus (iv.describes the orgies of the Scythians, who produced intoxicating fumes
by strewing hemp-seed upon red-hot stones, as the leaves and seed of the
Hasisha al fokara, or hemp-plant, are smoked in the East at the present
day.(See De Sacy, _Chrestom.Compare also
Plutarch de Fluviis (_de Hebro_, fr.), who speaks of a plant
resembling Origanum, from which the Thracians procured a stupefying
vapour, by burning the stalks:

edition of Milton's _Works_, in 1809, p.158., mentions the rumour,
without expressing any opinion of its truth.I think he omits all
mention of it in his subsequent edition in 1826, and therefore hope he
has adopted the prevailing opinion that it is a contemptible libel.In a
note to the former edition is a reference to Kennett's _Register_, p.38., and to _"Private forms of Prayer fitted for the late sad times,"
&c._, 12mo., Lond., 1660, attributed to Dr.An anonymous
author, quoting the verbal assurance of "a certain active Whigg," would
be entitled to little credit in attacking the character of the living,
and ought surely to be scouted when assailing the memory of the dead.In
Lowndes' _Bib.Man._ it is stated that

  "This miserable trash has been attributed to the author of
  Hudibras."_Voltaire's Henriade_ (Vol.).--I have two translations of
this poem in English verse, in addition to that mentioned at p.330.,
viz., one in 4to., Anon., London, 1797; and one by Daniel French, 8vo.,
London, 1807.The former, which, as I collect from the preface, was
written by a lady and a foreigner, alludes to two previous translations,
one in blank verse (probably Lockman's), and the other in rhyme.).--Your correspondent C. H.
appears to give me too much credit for diligence, in having "searched"
after this document; for in truth I did nothing beyond writing to the
rector of the parish, the Rev.All that I can positively
say as to my letter, is, that it was intended to be courteous; that it
stated my reason for the inquiry; that it contained an apology for the
liberty taken in applying to a stranger; and that Mr.Sockett did not
honour me with any answer.I believe, however, that I asked whether the
register still existed; if so, what was its nature, and over what period
it extended; and whether it had been printed or described in any
antiquarian or topographical book.Perhaps some reader may have the means of giving information on these
points; and if he will do so through the medium of your periodical, he
will oblige both C. H. and myself.Or perhaps C. H. may be able to
inquire through some more private channel, in which case I should feel
myself greatly indebted to him if he would have the goodness to let me
know the result.).--The solution of J. H. M. to MR."Alternate layers of sliced pippins
and mutton steaks" might indeed make a pie, but not an apple-pie,
therefore this puzzling phrase must have had some other origin.An
ingenious friend of mine has suggested that it may perhaps be derived
from that expression which we meet with in one of the scenes of
_Hamlet_, "Cap a pied;" where it means perfectly appointed.The
transition from _cap a pied_, or "cap a pie," to _apple-pie_, has rather
a rugged appearance, orthographically, I admit; but the ear soon becomes
accustomed to it in pronunciation.ROBERT SNOW and several other correspondents have also
  suggested that the origin of the phrase "apple-pie order" is to
  be found in the once familiar "cap a pied."]_Durham Sword that killed the Dragon_ (Vol.).--For details
of the tradition, and an engraving of the sword, see Surtees' _History
of Durham_, vol.--Your correspondent F. E. M. will find
the word _Malentour_, or _Malaentour_, given in Edmondson's _Complete
Body of Heraldry_ as the motto of the family of Patten alias Wansfleet
(_sic_) of Newington, Middlesex: it is said to be borne on a scroll over
the crest, which is a Tower in flames.In the "Book of Mottoes" the motto ascribed to the name of Patten is
_Mal au Tour_, and the double meaning is suggested, "Misfortune to the
Tower," and "Unskilled in artifice."The arms that accompany it in Edmondson are nearly the same as those of
William Pattyn alias Waynflete, Bishop of Winchester and Lord Chancellor
temp.VI.--the founder of Magdalen College, Oxford._The Bellman and his History_ (Vol.).--Since my
former communication on this subject I have been referred to the cut of
the Bellman and his _Dog_ in Collier's _Roxburghe Ballads_, p.59.,
taken from the first edition of Dekker's _Belman of London_, printed in
1608."_Geographers on Afric's Downs_" (Vol.).--Is your
correspondent A. S. correct in his quotation?In a poem of Swift's, "On
Poetry, a Rhapsody," are these lines:--

      "So geographers, in Afric maps
      With savage pictures fill their gaps,
      And o'er unhabitable downs
      Place elephants for want of towns."_Swift's Works, with Notes by Dr.Hawksworth_, 1767,
      vol."_Trepidation talk'd_" (Vol.).--The words attributed to
Milton are--

      "That crystalline sphere whose balance weighs
      The trepidation talk'd, and that first moved."Paterson's comment, quoted by your correspondent, is exquisite: he
evidently thinks there were two trepidations, one _talked_, the other
_first moved_.The _trepidation_ (not a tremulous, but a turning or oscillating motion)
is a well-known hypothesis added by the Arab astronomers to Ptolemy, in
explanation of the precession of the equinoxes.This precession they
imagined would continue retrograde for a long period, after which it
would be direct for another long period, then retrograde again, and so
on.They, or their European followers, I forget which, invented the
_crystal_ heaven, an apparatus outside of the _starry_ heaven (these
cast-off phrases of astronomy have entered into the service of poetry,
and the _empyreal_ heaven with them), to cause this slow turning, or
trepidation, in the starry heaven.Some used _two_ crystal heavens, and
I suspect that Paterson, having some confused idea of this, fancied he
found them both in Milton's text.I need not say that your correspondent
is quite right in referring the words _first moved_ to the _primum
mobile_.Again, _balance_ in Milton never _weighs_.Where he says of Satan's army (i.),

          "In even balance down they light
      On the firm brimstone,"

he appears to mean that they were in regular order, with a right wing to
balance the left wing.The direct motion of the crystal heaven,
following and compensating the retrograde one, is the "balance" which
"_was_ the trepidation _called_;" and this I suspect to be the true
reading.The past tense would be quite accurate, for all the Ptolemaists
of Milton's time had abandoned the _trepidation_.As the text stands it
is nonsense; even if Milton did _dictate_ it, we know that he never
_saw_ it; and there are several passages of which the obscurity may be
due to his having had to rely on others._Registry of Dissenting Baptisms in Churches_ (Vol.).--I
forward extracts from the Registers of the parish of Saint Benedict in
this town relating to the baptism of Dissenters.Hussey, mentioned
in several of the entries, was Joseph Hussey, minister of a Dissenting
congregation here from 1691 to 1720.His meeting-house on Hog Hill (now
St.Andrew's Hill) in this town was pillaged by a Jacobite mob, 29th
May, 1716.He died in London in 1726, and was the author of several
works, which are now very scarce.)William the Son of Richard Jardine and
  Elisabeth his Wife was baptiz'd in a Private Congregation by Mr.Hussey in ye name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost."Witnesses, Robert Wilson, Richard Jardine.Henery the Son of John and Sarah Shipp was baptized in a

  have been baptized in Separate Congregation.ye Son of Alexander and Elisa Jardine was
    said to be baptiz'd in a Separate Congregation."I have no recollection of having met with similar entries in any other
Parish Register.).--I think that upon further
consideration C. J. A. will find his egg to be merely that of a
blackbird.While the eggs of some birds are so constant in their
markings that to see one is to know all, others--at the head of which we
may place the sparrow, the gull tribe, the thrush, and the
blackbird--are as remarkable for the curious variety of their markings,
and even of the shades of their colouring.And every schoolboy's
collection will show that these distinctions will occur in the same
nest.I also believe that there has been some mistake about the nest, for
though, like the thrush, the blackbird coats the interior of its nest
with mud, &c., it does not, like that bird, leave this coating exposed,
but adds another lining of soft dried grass.PH***., asks
"What is Champak?"He will find a full description of the plant in Sir
William Jones's "Botanical Observations on Select Indian Plants," vol.In speaking of it, he says:

  "The strong aromatic scent of the gold-coloured Champac is thought
  offensive to the bees, who are never seen on its blossoms; but
  their elegant appearance on the black hair of the Indian women is
  mentioned by Rumphius; and both facts have supplied the Sanscrit
  poets with elegant allusions."D. C.




MISCELLANEOUS.NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.The first volume issued to the members of the Camden Society in return
for the present year's subscription affords in more than one way
evidence of the utility of that Society.It is an account _of Moneys
received and paid for Secret Services of Charles II.and James II._, and
is edited by Mr.in the possession of William Selby
Lowndes, Esq.Of the value of the book as materials towards illustrating
the history of the period over which the payments extend, namely from
March 1679 to December 1688, there can be as little doubt, as there can
be that but for the Camden Society it never could have been published.As a publishing speculation it could not have tempted any bookseller;
even if its owner would have consented to its being so given to the
world: and yet that in the simple entries of payments to the Duchess of
Portsmouth, to "Mrs.Ellinor Gwynne," to "Titus Oates," to the
Pendrells, &c., will be found much to throw light upon many obscure
passages of this eventful period of our national history, it is probable
that future editions of Mr.Macaulay's brilliant narrative of it will
afford ample proof._The Antiquarian Etching Club_, which was instituted two or three years
since for the purpose of rescuing from oblivion, and preserving by means
of the graver, objects of antiquarian interest, has just issued the
first part of its publications for 1851.This contains twenty-one plates
of various degrees of merit, but all of great interest to the antiquary,
who looks rather for fidelity of representation than for artistic
effect.CATALOGUES RECEIVED.--G.High Holborn), Catalogue, Part

  ILLUSTRATIONS AND ENQUIRIES RELATING To Mesmerism.Part I. By the
  REV.S. R. MAITLAND, DD.Sometime Librarian to the
  late Archbishop of Canterbury, and Keeper of the MSS."One of the most valuable and interesting pamphlets we ever
    read."--_Morning Herald._

    "This publication, which promises to be the commencement of a
    larger work, will well repay serious perusal."--_Ir.Journ._

    "A small pamphlet in which he throws a startling light on the
    practices of modern Mesmerism."--_Nottingham Journal._

    "Dr.Maitland, we consider, has here brought Mesmerism to the
    'touchstone of truth,' to the test of the standard of right or
    wrong.We thank him for this first instalment of his inquiry, and
    hope that he will not long delay the remaining portions."--_London
    Medical Gazette._

    "The Enquiries are extremely curious, we should indeed say
    important.That relating to the Witch of Endor is one of the most
    successful we ever read.We cannot enter into particulars in this
    brief notice; but we would strongly recommend the pamphlet even to
    those who care nothing about Mesmerism, or _angry_ (for it has
    come to this at last) with the subject."--_Dublin Evening Post._

    "We recommend its general perusal as being really an endeavour, by
    one whose position gives him the best facilities, to ascertain the
    genuine character of Mesmerism, which is so much
    disputed."--_Woolmer's Exeter Gazette._

    "Dr.Maitland has bestowed a vast deal of attention on the subject
    for many years past, and the present pamphlet is in part the
    result of his thoughts and inquiries.There is a good deal in it
    which we should have been glad to quote... but we content
    ourselves with referring our readers to the pamphlet
    itself."--_Brit.Mag._

    which Mr.Foss has brought to light many points previously
    unknown, corrected many errors, and shown such ample knowledge of
    his subject as to conduct it successfully through all the
    intricacies of a difficult investigation; and such taste and
    judgment as will enable him to quit, when occasion requires, the
    dry details of a professional inquiry, and to impart to his work
    as he proceeds, the grace and dignity of a philosophical

  view of the History of English Architecture, from the Heptarchy to
  the Reformation.By EDMUND SHARPE, M.A., Architect.Sharpe's reasons for advocating changes in the nomenclature
    of Rickman are worthy of attention, coming from an author who has
    entered very deeply into the analysis of Gothic architecture, and
    who has, in his 'Architectural Parallels,' followed a method of
    demonstration which has the highest possible
    value."--_Architectural Quarterly Review._

    "The author of one of the noblest architectural works of modern
    times.His 'Architectural Parallels' are worthy of the best days
    of art, and show care and knowledge of no common kind.All his
    lesser works have been marked in their degree by the same careful
    and honest spirit.His attempt to discriminate our architecture
    into periods and assign to it a new nomenclature, is therefore
    entitled to considerable respect."--_Guardian._

      | INDEX TO THE THIRD VOLUME.Brinsmade, tell me--all--"

"No, he is not dead, but he is very low.Russell has been kind
enough to come with me."But they were all there in the light,
in African postures of terror,--Alfred, and <DW71>, and Mammy Easter, and
Ned.They lifted the limp figure in gray, and carried it into the hall
chamber, his eyes closed, his face waxen under a beard brown and shaggy.Heavily, Virginia climbed the stairs to break the news to her aunt.There is little need to dwell on the dark days which followed--Clarence
hanging between life and death.That his life was saved was due to
Virginia and to Mammy Easter, and in no particle to his mother.Colfax flew in the face of all the known laws of nursing, until Virginia
was driven to desperation, and held a council of war with Dr.Then
her aunt grew jealous, talked of a conspiracy, and threatened to send
for Dr.By spells she wept,
when they quietly pushed her from the room and locked the door.She
would creep in to him in the night during Mammy Easter's watches and
talk him into a raging fever.But Virginia slept lightly and took the
alarm.More than one scene these two had in the small hours, while Ned
was riding post haste over the black road to town for the Doctor.By the same trusty messenger did Virginia contrive to send a note to
Mrs.Brice, begging her to explain her absence to Judge Whipple.By day
or night Virginia did not leave Bellegarde.Polk, while
walking in the garden, found the girl fast asleep on a bench, her sewing
on her lap.Would that a master had painted his face as he looked down
at her!'Twas he who brought Virginia daily news of Judge Whipple.He had become more querulous
and exacting with patient Mrs.But often, when he got into his buggy the Doctor found
the seat filled with roses and fresh fruit.What Virginia's feelings were at this time no one will ever know.God
had mercifully given her occupation, first with the Judge, and later,
when she needed it more, with Clarence.It was she whom he recognized
first of all, whose name was on his lips in his waking moments.With
the petulance of returning reason, he pushed his mother away.Unless
Virginia was at his bedside when he awoke, his fever rose.He put his
hot hand into her cool one, and it rested there sometimes for hours.Then, and only then, did he seem contented.The wonder was that her health did not fail.People who saw her during
that fearful summer, fresh and with color in her cheeks, marvelled.Great-hearted Puss Russell, who came frequently to inquire, was quieted
before her friend, and the frank and jesting tongue was silent in that
presence.Anne Brinsmade came with her father and wondered.Her poise, her gentleness, her dignity, were the
effects which people saw.And this is why
we cannot of ourselves add one cubit to our stature.It is God who
changes,--who cleanses us of our levity with the fire of trial.Happy,
thrice happy, those whom He chasteneth.And yet how many are there who
could not bear the fire--who would cry out at the flame.Little by little Clarence mended, until he came to sit out on the porch
in the cool of the afternoon.Then he would watch for hours the tassels
stirring over the green fields of corn and the river running beyond,
while the two women sat by.Colfax's headaches came
on, and Virginia was alone with him, he would talk of the war; sometimes
of their childhood, of the mad pranks they played here at Bellegarde,
of their friends.Only when Virginia read to him the Northern account of
the battles would he emerge from a calm sadness into excitement; and
he clenched his fists and tried to rise when he heard of the capture of
Jackson and the fall of Port Hudson.Of love he spoke not a word, and
now that he was better he ceased to hold her hand.But often when she
looked up from her book, she would surprise his dark eyes fixed upon
her, and a look in them of but one interpretation.The Doctor came but every other day now, in the afternoon.It was his
custom to sit for a while on the porch chatting cheerily with Virginia,
his stout frame filling the rocking-chair.Polk's indulgence was
gossip--though always of a harmless nature: how Mr.Cluyme always
managed to squirm over to the side which was in favor, and how Maude
Catherwood's love-letter to a certain dashing officer of the Confederate
army had been captured and ruthlessly published in the hateful Democrat.It was the Doctor who gave Virginia news of the Judge, and sometimes he
would mention Mrs.Then Clarence would raise his head; and once
(she saw with trepidation) he had opened his lips to speak.One day the Doctor came, and Virginia looked into his face and divined
that he had something to tell her.He sat but a few moments, and when he
arose to go he took her hand."I have a favor to beg of you, Jinny," he said, "Judge has lost his
nurse.Do you think Clarence could spare you for a little while every
day?Polk continued, somewhat hurriedly for
him, "but the Judge cannot bear a stranger near him, and I am afraid to
have him excited while in this condition."And Clarence, watching, saw her color
go.Polk, "but her son Stephen has come home from the
army.He was transferred to Lauman's brigade, and then he was wounded."He jangled the keys in his pocket and continued "It seems that he had no
business in the battle.Johnston in his retreat had driven animals into
all the ponds and shot them, and in the hot weather the water was soon
poisoned.Brice was scarcely well enough to stand when they made
the charge, and he is now in a dreadful condition He is a fine fellow,"
added the Doctor, with a sigh, "General Sherman sent a special physician
to the boat with him.He is--" Subconsciously the Doctor's arm sought
Virginia's back, as though he felt her swaying.But he was looking at
Clarence, who had jerked himself forward in his chair, his thin hands
convulsively clutching at the arms of it.In his astonishment the Doctor passed his palm across his brow, and for
a moment he did not answer.Virginia had taken a step from him, and was
standing motionless, almost rigid, her eyes on his face.he said, repeating the word mechanically; "my God, I hope not.The danger is over, and he is resting easily.If he were not," he said
quickly and forcibly, "I should not be here."The Doctor's mare passed more than one fleet--footed trotter on the
road to town that day.And the Doctor's black servant heard his master
utter the word "fool" twice, and with great emphasis.For a long time Virginia stood on the end of the porch, until the
heaving of the buggy harness died on the soft road, She felt Clarence
gaze upon her before she turned to face him."Virginia, sit here a moment; I have something to tell you."She came and took the chair beside him, her heart beating, her breast
rising and falling.She looked into his eyes, and her own lashes fell
before the hopelessness there But he put out his fingers wasted by
illness, and she took them in her own.He began slowly, as if every word cost him pain.I cannot remember the time
when I did not love you, when I did not think of you as my wife.All I
did when we played together was to try to win your applause.That was my
nature I could not help it.Do you remember the day I climbed out on the
rotten branch of the big pear tree yonder to get you that pear--when
I fell on the roof of Alfred's cabin?It was
because you kissed it and cried over me.You are crying now," he said
tenderly.It isn't to make you sad that I am saying this."I have had a great deal of time to think lately, Jinny, I was not
brought up seriously,--to be a man.I have been thinking of that day
just before you were eighteen, when you rode out here.The grapes were purple, and a purple
haze was over there across the river.You were
grown a woman then, and I was still nothing but a boy.Do you remember
the doe coming out of the forest, and how she ran screaming when I tried
to kiss you?It was true what you said, that I was wild and utterly useless,
I had never served or pleased any but myself,--and you.I had never
studied or worked, You were right when you told me I must learn
something,--do something,--become of some account in the world."Clarence, after what you have done for the South?""Crossed the river and burned
houses.Floated down the river on a log
after a few percussion caps."And how many had the courage to do that?""Pooh," he said, "courage!If I did not
have that, I would send <DW71> to my father's room for his ebony box and
blow my brains out.No, Jinny, I am nothing but a soldier of fortune.I never possessed any quality but a wild spirit for adventure, to
shirk work.I wanted to go with Walker, you remember.I wanted to distinguish myself," he added with a gesture."But
that is all gone now, Jinny.Now
I see how an earnest life might have won you.She raised her head, frightened, and looked at him searchingly."One day," he said, "one day a good many years ago you and I and Uncle
Comyn were walking along Market Street in front of Judge Whipple's
office, and a slave auction was going on.A girl was being sold on whom
you had set your heart.There was some one in the crowd, a Yankee, who
bid her in and set her free.He saw her profile, her lips parted, her look far away, She inclined her
head."Yes," said her cousin, "so do I remember him.He has crossed my path
many times since, Virginia.And mark what I say--it was he whom you
had in mind on that birthday when you implored me to make something of
myself, It was Stephen Brice.""I dare anything, Virginia," he answered quietly.And I am sure that you did not realize that he was the ideal which you
had in mind.""The impression of him has never left it.Again, that
night at the Brinsmades', when we were in fancy dress, I felt that I had
lost you when I got back.He had been there when I was away, and gone
again."It was a horrible mistake, Max," she faltered."I was waiting for you
down the road, and stopped his horse instead.It--it was nothing--"

"It was fate, Jinny.How I hated that
man," he cried, "how I hated him?""Yes," he said, "hated!But now--"

"But now?"I have not--I could not tell you before: He
came into the place where I was lying in Vicksburg, and they told
him that my only chance was to come North, I turned my back upon him,
insulted him.Yet he went to Sherman and had me brought home--to you,
Virginia.If he loves you,--and I have long suspected that he does--"

"Oh, no," she cried, hiding her face "No.""I know he loves you, Jinny," her cousin continued calmly, inexorably.It was a brave
thing to do, and a generous.He
thought that he was saving me for you.He was giving up the hope of
marrying you himself."Unless you had seen her then, you had never
known the woman in her glory."Clarence Colfax, have you known and loved
me all my life that you might accuse me of this?"Jinny, do you mean it?"In answer she bent down with all that gentleness and grace that
was hers, and pressed her lips to his forehead.Long after she had
disappeared in the door he sat staring after her.But later, when Mammy Easter went to call her mistress for supper, she
found her with her face buried in the pillows.CHAPTER X. IN JUDGE WHIPPLE'S OFFICE

After this Virginia went to the Judge's bedside every day, in the
morning, when Clarence took his sleep.She read his newspapers to him
when he was well enough.She read the detested Missouri Democrat, which
I think was the greatest trial Virginia ever had to put up with.To have
her beloved South abused, to have her heroes ridiculed, was more than
she could bear.Once, when the Judge was perceptibly better, she flung
the paper out of the window, and left the room."My dear," he said, smiling admiration, "forgive an old bear.A selfish
old bear, Jinny; my only excuse is my love for the Union.When you are
not here, I lie in agony, lest she has suffered some mortal blow unknown
to me, Jinny.And if God sees fit to spare our great country, the day
will come when you will go down on your knees and thank Him for the
inheritance which He saved for your children.You are a good woman, my
dear, and a strong one.I have hoped that you will see the right.That you will marry a great citizen, one unwavering in his service and
devotion to our Republic."The Judge's voice trembled with earnestness
as he spoke.And the gray eyes under the shaggy brows were alight with
the sacred fire of his life's purpose.Undaunted as her spirit was, she
could not answer him then.Once, only once, he said to her: "Virginia, I loved your father better
than any man I ever knew.Please God I may see him again before I die."But sometimes at twilight his eyes would
rest on the black cloth that hid it.Virginia herself never touched that cloth to her it seemed the shroud
upon a life of happiness that was dead and gone.Virginia had not been with Judge Whipple during the critical week after
Stephen was brought home.But Anne had told her that his anxiety was
a pitiful thing to see, and that it had left him perceptibly weaker.So fast that on some days
Virginia, watching him, would send Ned or Shadrach in hot haste for Dr.At noon Anne would relieve Virginia,--Anne or her mother,--and
frequently Mr.For it is those who have
the most to do who find the most time for charitable deeds.As the hour
for their coming drew near, the Judge would be seeking the clock, and
scarce did Anne's figure appear in the doorway before the question had
arisen to his lips--"And how is my young Captain to-day?"That is what he called him,--"My young Captain."Virginia's choice of
her cousin, and her devotion to him, while seemingly natural enough,
had drawn many a sigh from Anne.She thought it strange that Virginia
herself had never once asked her about Stephen's condition and she spoke
of this one day to the Judge with as much warmth as she was capable of."Jinny's heart is like steel where a Yankee is concerned.If her best
friend were a Yankee--"

Judge Whipple checked her, smiling."She has been very good to one Yankee I know of," he said.Brice, I believe she worships her.""But when I said that Stephen was much better to-day, she swept out of
the room as if she did not care whether he lived or died.""Well, Anne," the Judge had answered, "you women are a puzzle to me.I
guess you don't understand yourselves," he added.That was a strange month in the life of Clarence Colfax,--the last
of his recovery, while he was waiting for the news of his exchange.Bellegarde was never more beautiful, for Mrs.Colfax had no whim of
letting the place run down because a great war was in progress.Though
devoted to the South, she did not consecrate her fortune to it.Clarence
gave as much as he could.Whole afternoons Virginia and he would sit in the shaded arbor seat;
or at the cool of the day descend to the bench on the lower tier of
the summer garden, to steep, as it were, in the blended perfumes of the
roses and the mignonettes and the pinks.Often through the night he pondered on the change in her.But he was troubled to analyze her gravity, her dignity.Was this
merely strength of character, the natural result of the trials through
which she had passed, the habit acquired of being the Helper and
comforter instead of the helped and comforted?Long years afterward the
brightly  portrait of her remained in his eye,--the simple linen
gown of pink or white, the brown hair shining in the sunlight, the
graceful poise of the head.And the background of flowers--flowers
everywhere, far from the field of war.Sometimes, when she brought his breakfast on a tray in the morning,
there was laughter in her eyes.In the days gone by they had been all
laughter.He said it over to himself
many, many times in the day.He would sit for a space, feasting his eyes
upon her until she lifted her look to his, and the rich color flooded
her face.He was not a lover to sit quietly by, was Clarence.And yet,
as the winged days flew on, that is what he did, It was not that she
did not respond to his advances, he did not make them.Was it the chivalry inherited from a long life of Colfaxes who
were gentlemen?Something of awe had crept into his feeling
for her.As the month wore on, and the time drew near for him to go back to the
war, a state that was not quite estrangement, and yet something very
like it, set in.Doubts bothered him, and he dared not
give them voice.By night he would plan his speeches,--impassioned,
imploring.To see her in her marvellous severity was to strike him dumb.Whether she loved him, whether she did not love
him, she would not give him up.Through the long years of their lives
together, he would never know.He was not a weak man now, was Clarence
Colfax.He was merely a man possessed of a devil, enchained by the power
of self-repression come upon her whom he loved.And day by day that power seemed to grow more intense,--invulnerable.Among her friends and in the little household it had raised Virginia to
heights which she herself did not seem to realize.She was become the
mistress of Bellegarde.Colfax was under its sway, and doubly
miserable because Clarence would listen to her tirades no more.Nor had
she taken pains to hide the sarcasm in her voice.His answer, bringing with it her remembrance of her husband at certain
times when it was not safe to question him, had silenced her.Addison
Colfax had not been a quiet man."Whenever Virginia is ready, mother," he had replied.He knew in his heart that if he were to ask her permission
to send for Dr.Posthelwaite to-morrow that she would say yes.Tomorrow
came,--and with it a great envelope, an official, answer to Clarence's
report that he was fit for duty once more.He
was to proceed to Cairo, there to await the arrival of the transport
Indianapolis, which was to carry five hundred officers and men from
Sandusky Prison, who were going back to fight once more for the
Confederacy.O that they might have seen the North, all those brave men
who made that sacrifice.That they might have realized the numbers and
the resources and the wealth arrayed against them!It was a cool day for September, a perfect day, an auspicious day, and
yet it went the way of the others before it.This was the very fulness
of the year, the earth giving out the sweetness of her maturity, the
corn in martial ranks, with golden plumes nodding.The forest still
in its glory of green.They walked in silence the familiar paths, and
Alfred, clipping the late roses for the supper table, shook his
white head as they passed him.The sun, who had begun to hurry on his
southward journey, went to bed at six.The few clothes Clarence was to
take with him had been packed by Virginia in his bag, and the two were
standing in the twilight on the steps of the house, when Ned came around
the corner.He called his young mistress by name, but she did not hear
him.She started as from a sleep, and paused.He wore that air of mystery so
dear to darkeys."Gemmen to see you, Miss Jinny."The <DW64> pointed to the lilac shrubbery.said Clarence, sharply: "If a man is
there, bring him here at once.""Reckon he won't come, Marse Clarence."said Ned, "He fearful skeered ob
de light ob day.He got suthin very pertickler fo' Miss Jinny.""No sah--yessah--leastwise I'be seed 'um.The word was hardly out of his mouth before Virginia had leaped down the
four feet from the porch to the flower-bed and was running across the
lawn toward the shrubbery.Parting the bushes after her, Clarence found
his cousin confronting a large man, whom he recognized as the carrier
who brought messages from the South."Pa has got through the lines," she said breathlessly."He--he came up
to see me."He went to Judge Whipple's rooms, ma'am.I
reckoned you knew it, Miss Jinny," Robinson added contritely."Clarence," she said, "I must go at once.""I will go with you," he said; "you cannot go alone."In a twinkling Ned
and <DW71> had the swift pair of horses harnessed, and the light carriage
was flying over the soft clay road toward the city.Brinsmade's place, the moon hung like a great round lantern under
the spreading trees about the house.Clarence caught a glimpse of his
cousin's face in the light.She was leaning forward, her gaze fixed
intently on the stone posts which stood like monuments between the
bushes at the entrance.Then she drew back again into the dark corner
of the barouche.She was startled by a sharp challenge, and the carriage
stopped.Looking out, she saw the provost's guard like black card
figures on the road, and Ned fumbling for his pass.On they drove into the city streets until the dark bulk of the Court
House loomed in front of them, and Ned drew rein at the little stairway
which led to the Judge's rooms.Virginia, leaping out of the carriage,
flew up the steps and into the outer office, and landed in the Colonel's
arms."Why do you risk your life in this way?If the
Yankees catch you--"

"They won't catch me, honey," he answered, kissing her.Then he held her
out at arm's length and gazed earnestly into her face.Trembling, she
searched his own."I'm not precisely young, my dear," he said, smiling.His hair was
nearly white, and his face scared.But he was a fine erect figure of a
man, despite the shabby clothes he wore, and the mud-bespattered boots."Pa," she whispered, "it was foolhardy to come here."I came to see you, Jinny, I reckon.And when I got home to-night and
heard Silas was dying, I just couldn't resist.He's the oldest friend
I've got in St.Louis, honey and now--now--"

"Pa, you've been in battle?""And you weren't hurt; I thank God for that," she whispered.After a
while: "Is Uncle Silas dying?"Polk is in there now, and says that he can't last
through the night.Silas has been asking for you, honey, over and over.He says you were very good to him,--that you and Mrs.Brice gave up
everything to nurse him.""She was here night and day until her son
came home.She is a noble woman--"

"Her son?"Silas has done nothing
the last half-hour but call his name.He says he must see the boy before
he dies.Polk says he is not strong enough to come.""Oh, no, he is not strong enough," cried Virginia.The Colonel looked
down at her queerly.She turned hurriedly, glanced around
the room, and then peered down the dark stairway.I wonder why he did not follow me up?"Then after a long pause, seeing her father said nothing, she added,
"Perhaps he was waiting for you to see me alone.I will go down to see
if he is in the carriage."The Colonel started with her, but she pulled him back in alarm."You will be seen, Pa," she cried.He stayed at the top of the passage, holding open the door that she
might have light.When she reached the sidewalk, there was Ned standing
beside the horses, and the carriage empty.Fust I seed was a man plump out'n Willums's, Miss Jinny.He was
a-gwine shufflin' up de street when Marse Clarence put out after him,
pos' has'e.She stood for a moment on the pavement in thought, and paused on the
stairs again, wondering whether it were best to tell her father.Perhaps
Clarence had seen--she caught her breath at the thought and pushed open
the door."Oh, Pa, do you think you are safe here?""Why, yes, honey, I
reckon so," he answered."Ned says he ran after a man who was hiding in an entrance.Pa, I am
afraid they are watching the place.""I don't think so, Jinny.I came here with Polk, in his buggy, after
dark."Virginia, listening, heard footsteps on the stairs, and seized her
father's sleeve."Think of the risk you are running, Pa," she whispered.She would have
dragged him to the closet.Brinsmade entered, and with him a lady veiled.How long
he stared at his old friend Virginia could not say.It seemed to her an
eternity.Brice has often told since how straight the Colonel
stood, his fine head thrown back, as he returned the glance.Brinsmade came forward, with his hand outstretched."Comyn," said he, his voice breaking a little, "I have known you these
many years as a man of unstained honor.God will judge whether I have done my duty.""I give
you my word of honor as a gentleman that I came into this city for no
other reason than to see my daughter.And hearing that my old friend was
dying, I could not resist the temptation, sir--"

Mr.How many men do you think would risk their
lives so, Mrs."Thank God he will now
die happy.I know it has been much on his mind.""And in his name, madam,--in the name of my oldest and best friend,--I
thank you for what you have done for him.I trust that you will allow me
to add that I have learned from my daughter to respect and admire you.I
hope that your son is doing well.""He is, thank you, Colonel Carvel.If he but knew that the Judge were
dying, I could not have kept him at home.Polk says that he must not
leave the house, or undergo any excitement."Just then the door of the inner room opened, and Dr.Brinsmade, and he patted Virginia."The Judge is still asleep," he said gently."And--he may not wake up in
this world."Silently, sadly, they went together into that little room where so
much of Judge Whipple's life had been spent.And
how completely they filled it,--these five people and the big Rothfield
covered with the black cloth.Virginia pressed her father's arm as they
leaned against it, and brushed her eyes.The Doctor turned the wick of
the night-lamp.What was that upon the sleeper's face from which they drew back?The divine light which is shed upon those
who have lived for others, who have denied themselves the lusts of the
flesh, For a long space, perhaps an hour, they stayed, silent save for
a low word now and again from the Doctor as he felt the Judge's heart.Tableaux from the past floated before Virginia's eyes.Of the old days,
of the happy days in Locust Street, of the Judge quarrelling with her
father, and she and Captain Lige smiling nearby.And she remembered how
sometimes when the controversy was finished the Judge would rub his nose
and say:

"It's my turn now, Lige."Whereupon the Captain would open the piano, and she would play the hymn
that he liked best.What was it in Silas Whipple's nature that courted the pain of memories?What pleasure could it have been all through his illness to look upon
this silent and cruel reminder of days gone by forever?She had heard
that Stephen Brice had been with the Judge when he had bid it in.She
wondered that he had allowed it, for they said that he was the only
one who had ever been known to break the Judge's will.Virginia's
eyes rested on Margaret Brice, who was seated at the head of the bed,
smoothing the pillows The strength of Stephen's features were in hers,
but not the ruggedness.Her features were large, indeed, yet stanch and
softened.The widow, as if feeling Virginia's look upon her, glanced up
from the Judge's face and smiled at her.The girl  with pleasure,
and again at the thought which she had had of the likeness between
mother and son.Still the Judge slept on, while they watched.And at length the thought
of Clarence crossed Virginia's mind.Whispering to her father, she stole out on tiptoe.Descending to the street, she was unable to gain any news of Clarence
from Ned, who was becoming alarmed likewise.Perplexed and troubled, she climbed the stairs again.No sound came from
the Judge's room Perhaps Clarence would be back at any moment.She sat down to think,--her elbows on the desk
in front of her, her chin in her hand, her eyes at the level of a line
of books which stood on end.--Chitty's Pleadings, Blackstone, Greenleaf
on Evidence.Absently; as a person whose mind is in trouble, she reached
out and took one of them down and opened it.Across the flyleaf, in a
high and bold hand, was written the name, Stephen Atterbury Brice.She dropped the book, and, rising abruptly, crossed quickly to the other
side of the room.Then she turned, hesitatingly, and went back.This was
his desk--his chair, in which he had worked so faithfully for the man
who lay dying beyond the door.For him whom they all loved--whose last
hours they were were to soothe.Wars and schisms may part our bodies,
but stronger ties unite our souls.Through Silas Whipple, through his
mother, Virginia knew that she was woven of one piece with Stephen
Brice.In a thousand ways she was reminded, lest she drive it from her
belief.She might marry another, and that would not matter.She sank again into his chair, and gave herself over to the thoughts
crowding in her heart.How the threads of his life ran next to hers, and
crossed and recrossed them.The slave auction, her dance with him, the
Fair, the meeting at Mr.Brinsmade's gate,--she knew them all.Her dreams of him--for she did dream
of him.And now he had saved Clarence's life that she might marry her
cousin.Again she glanced at the
signature in the book, as if fascinated by the very strength of it.She
turned over a few pages of the book, "Supposing the defendant's counsel
essays to prove by means of--" that was his writing again, a marginal,
note.There were marginal notes on every page--even the last was covered
with them, And then at the end, "First reading, February, 1858.Bought with some of money obtained by first article
for M.That capacity for work, incomparable gift, was what she had
always coveted the most.Again she rested her elbows on the desk and her
chin on her hands, and sighed unconsciously.She had not heard the step on the stair.She did not know that any one wage in the room until she heard his
voice, and then she thought that she was dreaming.Slowly she raised her face to his, unbelief and wonder in her
eyes,--unbelief and wonder and fright.But
when she met the quality of his look, the grave tenderness of it, she
trembled, and our rendered her own to the page where his handwriting
quivered and became a blur.He never knew the effort it cost her to rise and confront him.She
herself had not measured or fathomed the power which his very person
exhaled.He needed not to have
spoken for her to have felt that.She
knew alone that it was nigh irresistible, and she grasped the back of
the chair as though material support might sustain her."Not--not yet, They are waiting for the end."he asked in grave surprise, glancing at the door of the
Judge's room."I am waiting for my cousin," she said.Even as she spoke she was with this man again at the Brinsmade gate.Intuition told her that he, too, was
thinking of that time.Now he had found her at his desk, and, as if that
were not humiliation enough, with one of his books taken down and laid
open at his signature.Suffused, she groped for words to carry her on.He was here, and is gone
somewhere."He did not seem to take account of the speech.And his silence--goad
to indiscretion--pressed her to add:-- "You saved him, Mr.I--we
all--thank you so much.And that is not all I want to say.It is a poor
enough acknowledgment of what you did,--for we have not always treated
you well."Her voice faltered almost to faintness, as he raised his hand
in pained protest.But she continued: "I shall regard it as a debt I can
never repay.It is not likely that in my life to come I can ever help
you, but I shall pray for that opportunity.""I did nothing, Miss Carvel, nothing that the most unfeeling man in our
army would not do.Nothing that I would not have done for the merest
stranger.""You saved him for me," she said.She turned away from him for
very shame, and yet she heard him saying:-- "Yes, I saved him for you."His voice was in the very note of the sadness which has the strength
to suffer, to put aside the thought of self.A note to which her soul
responded with anguish when she turned to him with the natural cry of
woman."Oh, you ought not to have come here to-night."It does not matter much," he answered."I guessed it,--because my mother had left me.""Oh, you ought not to have come!""The Judge has been my benefactor," he answered quietly."I could walk,
and it was my duty to come."He smiled, "I had no carriage," he said.With the instinct of her sex she seized the chair and placed it under
him."You must sit down at once," she cried."But I am not tired," he replied."Oh, you must sit down, you must, Captain Brice."He started at the
title, which came so prettily from her lips, "Won't you please!"And, as the sun peeps out of a troubled sky, she smiled.He glanced at the book, and the bit of sky was crimson."It is your book," she stammered."I did not know that it was yours
when I took it down.I--I was looking at it while I was waiting for
Clarence.""It is dry reading," he remarked, which was not what he wished to say."And yet--"

"Yes?"The confession had slipped to her
lips.She was sitting on the edge of his desk, looking down at him.All the will that was left him averted his head.And the seal of honor was upon his speech.And he wondered if man were
ever more tempted.Then the evil spread its wings, and soared away into the night.Peace seemed to come upon them both, quieting the
tumult in their hearts, and giving them back their reason.Respect like
wise came to the girl,--respect that was akin to awe."My mother has me how faithfully you nursed the Judge, Miss Carvel.It
was a very noble thing to do.""Not noble at all," she replied hastily, "your mother did the most of
it, And he is an old friend of my father--"

"It was none the less noble," said Stephen, warmly, "And he quarrelled
with Colonel Carvel.""My father quarrelled with him," she corrected."It was well that I
should make some atonement.And yet mine was no atonement, I love Judge
Whipple.It was a--a privilege to see your mother every day--oh, how
he would talk of you!I think he loves you better than any one on this
earth.""Tell me about him," said Stephen, gently.Virginia told him, and into the narrative she threw the whole of her
pent-up self.How patient the Judge had been, and the joy he had derived
from Stephen's letters."You were very good to write to him so often,"
she said.It seemed like a dream to Stephen, like one of the many dreams
of her, the mystery of which was of the inner life beyond our ken.He
could not recall a time when she had not been rebellious, antagonistic.And now--as he listened to her voice, with its exquisite low tones and
modulations, as he sat there in this sacred intimacy, perchance to be
the last in his life, he became dazed.His eyes, softened, with supreme
eloquence cried out that she, was his, forever and forever.The magnetic
force which God uses to tie the worlds together was pulling him to her.Then the door swung open, and Clarence Colfax, out of breath, ran into
the room.He stopped short when he saw them, his hand fell to his sides,
and his words died on his lips.It was Stephen who rose to meet him, and with her eyes the girl followed
his motions.The broad and loosely built frame of the Northerner, his
shoulders slightly stooping, contrasted with Clarence's slighter figure,
erect, compact, springy.The Southerner's eye, for that moment, was
flint struck with the spark from the steel.Stephen's face, thinned by
illness, was grave.For an instant
they stood thus regarding each other, neither offering a hand.It was
Stephen who spoke first, and if there was a trace of emotion in his
voice, one who was listening intently failed to mark it."I am glad to see that you have recovered, Colonel Colfax," he said."I should indeed be without gratitude if I did not thank Captain Brice
for my life," answered Clarence.She had detected the
undue accent on her cousin's last words, and she glanced apprehensively
at Stephen."Miss Carvel has already thanked me sufficiently, sir," he said."I am
happy to have been able to have done you a good turn, and at the same
time to have served her so well.It is
to her your thanks are chiefly due.I believe that I am not going too
far, Colonel Colfax," he added, "when I congratulate you both."Before her cousin could recover, Virginia slid down from the desk and
had come between them.How her eyes shone and her lip trembled as she
gazed at him, Stephen has never forgotten.What a woman she was as she
took her cousin's arm and made him a curtsey."What you have done may seem a light thing to you, Captain Brice," she
said."That is apt to be the way with those who have big hearts.You
have put upon Colonel Colfax, and upon me, a life's obligation."When she began to speak, Clarence raised his head.As he glanced,
incredulous, from her to Stephen, his look gradually softened, and
when she had finished, his manner had become again frank, boyish,
impetuous--nay, penitent."Forgive me, Brice," he cried.I--I did you an injustice, and you, Virginia.I was a fool--a
scoundrel.""No, you were neither," he said.Then upon his face came the smile of
one who has the strength to renounce, all that is dearest to him--that
smile of the unselfish, sweetest of all.She was to see it once again, upon the features of one who bore a
cross,--Abraham Lincoln.Clarence looked, and then he turned away toward
the door to the stairway, as one who walks blindly, in a sorrow.His hand was on the knob when Virginia seemed to awake.She flew after
him:

"Wait!"Then she raised her eyes, slowly, to Stephen, who was standing
motionless beside his chair."My father is in the Judge's room," she said."I thought--"

"That he was an officer in the Confederate Army.She took
a step toward him, appealingly."Oh, he is not a spy," she cried."He has given Mr Brinsmade his word
that he came here for no other purpose than to see me.Then he heard
that the Judge was dying--"

"He has given his word to Mr."Then," said Stephen, "what Mr.Brinsmade sanctions is not for me to
question."She gave him yet another look, a fleeting one which he did not see.Then
she softly opened the door and passed into the room of the dying man.As for Clarence, he stood for a space staring
after them.Then he went noiselessly down the stairs into the street.LEAD, KINDLY LIGHT

When the Judge opened his eyes for the last time in this world, they
fell first upon the face of his old friend, Colonel Carvel.Twice he
tried to speak his name, and twice he failed.The third time he said it
faintly."Comyn, what are you doing here?"I reckon I came to see you, Silas," answered the Colonel."To see me die," said the Judge, grimly.Colonel Carvel's face twitched, and the silence in that little room
seemed to throb."Comyn," said the Judge again, "I heard that you had gone South to fight
against your country.Can it be that you have at last
returned in your allegiances to the flag for which your forefathers
died?"Poor Colonel Carvel

"I am still of the same mind, Silas," he said.The Judge turned his face away, his thin lips moving as in prayer.But
they knew that he was not praying, "Silas," said Mr.Carvel, "we were
friends for twenty years.Let us be friends again, before--"

"Before I die," the Judge interrupted, "I am ready to die.I have had a hard life, Comyn, and few friends.I--I did not know how to make them.Yet no man ever valued those few
more than!But," he cried, the stern fire unquenched to the last, "I
would that God had spared me to see this Rebellion stamped out.To those watching, his eyes seemed fixed on a
distant point, and the light of prophecy was in them."I would that
God had spared me to see this Union supreme once more.A high destiny is reserved for this nation--!I think the
highest of all on this earth."Amid profound silence he leaned back on
the pillows from which he had risen, his breath coming fast.None dared
look at the neighbor beside them."Would you not like to see a
clergyman, Judge?"The look on his face softened as he turned to her."No, madam," he answered; "you are clergyman enough for me.You are near
enough to God--there is no one in this room who is not worthy to stand
in the presence of death.Yet I wish that a clergyman were here, that
he might listen to one thing I have to say.When I was a boy I worked my
way down the river to New York, to see the city.He said to me, 'Sit down, my son, I want to talk to you.I said to him, 'No,
sir, I am not Senator Whipple's son.If the
bishop had wished to talk to me after that, Mrs.Brice, he might have
made my life a little easier--a little sweeter.I know that they are not
all like that.But it was by just such things that I was embittered when
I was a boy."He stopped, and when he spoke again, it was more slowly,
more gently, than any of them had heard him speak in all his life
before."I wish that some of the blessings which I am leaving now had
come to me then--when I was a boy.I might have done my little share in
making the world a brighter place to live in, as all of you have done.Yes, as all of you are now doing for me.I am leaving the world with a
better opinion of it than I ever held in life.God hid the sun from me
when I was a little child.Margaret Brice," he said, "if I had had such
a mother as you, I would have been softened then.I thank God that He
sent you when He did."The widow bowed her head, and a tear fell upon his pillow."I have done nothing," she murmured, "nothing.""So shall they answer at the last whom He has chosen," said the Judge."I was sick, and ye visited me.He has promised to remember those who do
that.He has
given you a son whom all men may look in the face, of whom you need
never be ashamed.Stephen," said the Judge, "come here."Stephen made his way to the bedside, but because of the moisture in his
eyes he saw but dimly the gaunt face.And yet he shrank back in awe at
the change in it.So must all of the martyrs have looked when the
fire of the <DW19>s licked their feet.So must John Bunyan have stared
through his prison bars at the sky."Stephen," he said, "you have been faithful in a few things.So shall
you be made ruler over many things.The little I have I leave to you,
and the chief of this is an untarnished name.I know that you will be
true to it because I have tried your strength.Listen carefully to what
I have to say, for I have thought over it long.In the days gone by our
fathers worked for the good of the people, and they had no thought of
gain.A time is coming when we shall need that blood and that bone in
this Republic.Wealth not yet dreamed of will flow out of this land, and
the waters of it will rot all save the pure, and corrupt all save the
incorruptible.Half-tried men wilt go down before that flood.You and
those like you will remember how your fathers governed,--strongly,
sternly, justly.Serve your city, serve your state, but above all serve
your country."He paused to catch his breath, which was coming painfully now, and
reached out his bony hand to seek Stephen's."I was harsh with you at
first, my son," he went on.And when I had tried
you I wished your mind to open, to keep pace with the growth of this
nation.I sent you to see Abraham Lincoln that you might be born
again--in the West.I saw it when you came back--I
saw it in your face.O God," he cried, with sudden eloquence."I would
that his hands--Abraham Lincoln's hands--might be laid upon all who
complain and cavil and criticise, and think of the little things in
life: I would that his spirit might possess their spirit!"They marvelled and were awed, for never in all his
days had such speech broken from this man."Good-by, Stephen," he said,
when they thought he was not to speak again."Hold the image of Abraham
Lincoln in front of you.You--you are a man after his
own heart--and--and mine."They started for ward, for his eyes
were closed.But presently he stirred again, and opened them."Brinsmade," he said, "Brinsmade, take care of my orphan girls.The <DW64> came forth, shuffling and sobbing, from the doorway."You ain't gwine away, Marse Judge?""Yes, Shadrach, good-by.You have served me well, I have left you
provided for."Shadrach kissed the hand of whose secret charity he knew so much.Then
the Judge withdrew it, and motioned to him to rise.And Colonel Carvel came from the corner where he had
been listening, with his face drawn.You were my friend when there was none other.You were
true to me when the hand of every man was against me.You--you have
risked your life to come to me here, May God spare it for Virginia."At the sound of her name, the girl started.And when she kissed him on the forehead, he trembled.Weakly he reached up and put his hands on her shoulders.The tears came and lay wet upon her lashes as she undid the
button at his throat.There, on a piece of cotton twine, hung a little key, She took it off,
but still his hands held her."I have saved it for you, my dear," he said."God bless you--" why did
his eyes seek Stephen's?--"and make your life happy.Virginia--will you
play my hymn--once more--once more?"They lifted the night lamp from the piano, and the medicine.It was
Stephen who stripped it of the black cloth it had worn, who stood by
Virginia ready to lift the lid when she had turned the lock.The girl's
exaltation gave a trembling touch divine to the well-remembered chords,
and those who heard were lifted, lifted far above and beyond the power
of earthly spell."Lead, Kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom
        Lead Thou me on
        The night is dark, and I am far from home;
        Lead Thou me on.I do not ask to see
        The distant scene; one step enough for me."A sigh shook Silas Whipple's wasted frame, and he died.Brinsmade and the Doctor were the first to leave the little room
where Silas Whipple had lived and worked and died, Mr.Brinsmade bent
upon one of those errands which claimed him at all times.Virginia sat on, a vague fear haunting her,--a fear
for her father's safety.These questions, at first intruding upon her sorrow,
remained to torture her.Softly she stirred from the chair where she had sat before the piano,
and opened the door of the outer office.A clock in a steeple near by
was striking twelve.Only Stephen
saw her go; she felt his eyes following her, and as she slipped out
lifted hers to meet them for a brief instant through the opening of the
door.First of all she knew that the light in the outer office was burning
dimly, and the discovery gave her a shock.Fearfully searching the room for him, her gaze
was held by a figure in the recess of the window at the back of the
room.A solid, bulky figure it was, and, though uncertainly outlined
in the semi-darkness, she knew it.She took a step nearer, and a cry
escaped her.The man was Eliphalet Hopper.He got down from the sill with a motion
at once sheepish and stealthy.Her breath caught, and instinctively she
gave back toward the door, as if to open it again."I've got something I want to say to you, Miss
Virginia."But she
shivered and paused, horrified at the thought of what she was about to
do.Her father was in that room--and Stephen.She must keep them there,
and get this man away.She must not show fright before him, and yet she
could not trust her voice to speak just then.She must not let him know
that she was afraid of him--this she kept repeating to herself.Virginia never knew how she gathered the courage to pass him, even
swiftly, and turn up the gas.He started back, blinking as the
jet flared.For a moment she stood beside it, with her head high;
confronting him and striving to steady herself for speech."Judge Whipple--died--to-night."The dominating note in his answer was a whine, as if, in spite of
himself, he were awed."I ain't here to see the Judge."She felt her
lips moving, but knew not whether the words had come.The look in his little eyes was the filmy look of
those of an animal feasting."I came here to see you," he said, "--you."She was staring at him now,
in horror."And if you don't give me what I want, I cal'late to see some
one else--in there," said Mr.He smiled, for she was swaying, her lids half closed.By a supreme
effort she conquered her terror and looked at him.The look was in his
eyes still, intensified now."How dare you speak to me after what has happened!If Colonel
Carvel were here, he would--kill you."He flinched at the name and the word, involuntarily.He wiped his
forehead, hot at the very thought.Then,
remembering his advantage, he stepped close to her."He is here," he said, intense now."He is here, in that there room."Virginia struggled, and yet she refrained from crying
out."He never leaves this city without I choose.I can have him hung if
I choose," he whispered, next to her.she cried; "oh, if you choose!"Still his body crept closer, and his face closer."There's but one price to pay," he said hoarsely, "there's but one price
to pay, and that's you--you.I cal'late you'll marry me now."Delirious at the touch of her, he did not hear the door open.Her senses
were strained for that very sound.She heard it close again, and a
footstep across the room.She knew the step--she knew the voice, and her
heart leaped at the sound of it in anger.An arm in a blue sleeve came
between them, and Eliphalet Hopper staggered and fell across the books
on the table, his hand to his face.Towered was the impression that came to Virginia then, and so she
thought of the scene ever afterward.Small bits, like points of tempered
steel, glittered in Stephen's eyes, and his hands following up the
mastery he had given them clutched Mr.Twice Stephen
shook him so that his head beat upon the table.he cried, but he kept his voice low.And then, as if
he expected Hopper to reply: "Shall I kill you?"He turned slowly, and his hands fell from
Mr.Hopper's cowering form as his eyes met hers.Even he could not
fathom the appeal, the yearning, in their dark blue depths.And yet what
he saw there made him tremble."He--he won't touch me again while you
are here."Eliphalet Hopper raised himself from the desk, and one of the big books
fell with a crash to the floor.Then they saw him shrink, his eyes fixed
upon some one behind them.Before the Judge's door stood Colonel Carvel,
in calm, familiar posture, his feet apart, and his head bent forward as
he pulled at his goatee."What is this man doing here, Virginia?"She did not answer
him, nor did speech seem to come easily to Mr.Perhaps the sight of Colonel Carvel had brought before him too, vividly
the memory of that afternoon at Glencoe.All at once Virginia grasped the fulness of the power in this man's
hands.At a word from him her father would be shot as a spy--and Stephen
Brice, perhaps, as a traitor.But if Colonel Carvel should learn that he
had seized her,--here was the terrible danger of the situation.Well she
knew what the Colonel would do.She trusted in
his coolness that he would not.Before a word of reply came from any of the three, a noise was heard
on the stairway.There followed four seconds
of suspense, and then Clarence came in.She saw that his face wore a
worried, dejected look.It changed instantly when he glanced about
him, and an oath broke from his lips as he singled out Eliphalet Hopper
standing in sullen aggressiveness, beside the table."So you're the spy, are you?"Then he turned his
back and faced his uncle."I saw, him in Williams's entry as we drove
up.He strode to the open window at the back
of the office, and looked out, There was a roof under it."The sneak got in here," he said."He knew I was waiting for him in the
street.Hopper passed a heavy hand across the cheek where Stephen had struck
him."No, I ain't the spy," he said, with a meaning glance at the Colonel."I cal'late that he knows," Eliphalet replied, jerking his head toward
Colonel Carvel.What's to prevent my
calling up the provost's guard below?"he continued, with a smile that
was hideous on his swelling face.It was the Colonel who answered him, very quickly and very clearly.Stephen, who was watching him, could not tell
whether it were a grim smile that creased the corners of the Colonel's
mouth as he added.Hopper did not move, but his eyes shifted to Virginia's form.Stephen deliberately thrust himself between them that he might not see
her.said the Colonel, in the mild voice that
should have been an ominous warning.It
was clear that he had not reckoned upon all of this; that he had waited
in the window to deal with Virginia alone.But now the very force of a
desire which had gathered strength in many years made him reckless.His
voice took on the oily quality in which he was wont to bargain."Let's be calm about this business, Colonel," he said."We won't say
anything about the past.But I ain't set on having you shot.There's a
consideration that would stop me, and I cal'late you know what it is."But before he had taken a step Virginia
had crossed the room swiftly, and flung herself upon him.The last word came falteringly,
faintly."Let me go,--honey," whispered the Colonel, gently.His eyes did not
leave Eliphalet.He tried to disengage himself, but her fingers were
clasped about his neck in a passion of fear and love.And then, while
she clung to him, her head was raised to listen.The sound of Stephen
Brice's voice held her as in a spell.His words were coming coldly,
deliberately, and yet so sharply that each seemed to fall like a lash.Hopper, if ever I hear of your repeating what you have seen or
heard in this room, I will make this city and this state too hot for
you to live in.I know how you hide in areas, how you talk
sedition in private, how you have made money out of other men's misery.And, what is more, I can prove that you have had traitorous dealings
with the Confederacy.General Sherman has been good enough to call
himself a friend of mine, and if he prosecutes you for your dealings
in Memphis, you will get a term in a Government prison, You ought to be
hung.Colonel Carvel has shown you the door.FROM THE LETTERS OF MAJOR STEPHEN BRICE

Of the Staff of General Sherman on the March to the Sea, and on the
March from Savannah Northward.HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI GOLDSBORO, N.C.MARCH
24, 1865

DEAR MOTHER: The South Carolina Campaign is a thing of the past.I pause
as I write these words--they seem so incredible to me.We have marched
the four hundred and twenty-five miles in fifty days, and the General
himself has said that it is the longest and most important march ever
made by an organized army in a civilized country.I know that you will
not be misled by the words "civilized country."Not until the history of
this campaign is written will the public realize the wide rivers and
all but impassable swamps we have crossed with our baggage trains and
artillery.The roads (by courtesy so called) were a sea of molasses and
every mile of them has had to be corduroyed.For fear of worrying you I
did not write you from Savannah how they laughed at us for starting at
that season of the year.They said we would not go ten miles, and I most
solemnly believe that no one but "Uncle Billy" and an army organized and
equipped by him could have gone ten miles.You have probably remarked in the tone of my letters ever since we left
Kingston for the sea, a growing admiration for "my General."It seems very strange that this wonderful tactician can be the same man
I met that day going to the Arsenal in the streetcar, and again at Camp
Jackson.I am sure that history will give him a high place among the
commanders of the world.Certainly none was ever more tireless than
he.He never fights a battle when it can be avoided, and his march into
Columbia while threatening Charleston and Augusta was certainly a master
stroke of strategy.You should see him as
he rides through the army, an erect figure, with his clothes all angular
and awry, and an expanse of white sock showing above his low shoes.You can hear his name running from file to file; and some times the
new regiments can't resist cheering.He generally says to the
Colonel:--"Stop that noise, sir.On our march to the sea, if the orders were ever given to turn
northward, "the boys" would get very much depressed.One moonlight night
I was walking my horse close to the General's over the pine needles,
when we overheard this conversation between two soldiers:-- "Say, John,"
said one, "I guess Uncle Billy don't know our corps is goin' north.""I wonder if he does,'" said John."If I could only get a sight of them
white socks, I'd know it was all right."The General rode past without a word, but I heard him telling the story
to Mower the next day.I can find little if any change in his manner since I knew him first.He is brusque, but kindly, and he has the same comradeship with officers
and men--and even the <DW64>s who flock to our army.But few dare to
take advantage of it, and they never do so twice.I have been very near
to him, and have tried not to worry him or ask many foolish questions.Sometimes on the march he will beckon me to close up to him, and we have
a conversation something on this order:-- "There's Kenesaw, Brice.""Went beyond lines there with small party.Next day I thought Rebels would leave in the night.Got up before daylight, fixed telescope on stand, and waited.Saw one blue man creep up, very cautious,
looked around, waved his hat.This gives you but a faint idea of the vividness of his talk.When we
make a halt for any time, the general officers and their staffs flock
to headquarters to listen to his stories.When anything goes wrong, his
perception of it is like a lightning flash,--and he acts as quickly.By the way, I have just found the letter he wrote me, offering this
staff position.Please keep it carefully, as it is something I shall
value all my life.GAYLESVILLE, ALABAMA, October 25, 1864.MAJOR STEPHEN A. BRICE:

   Dear Sir,--The world goes on, and wicked men sound asleep.Davis
   has sworn to destroy my army, and Beauregard has come to do the
   work,--so if you expect to share in our calamity, come down.I
   offer you this last chance for staff duty, and hope you have had
   enough in the field.I do not wish to hurry you, but you can't get
   aboard a ship at sea.So if you want to make the trip, come to
   Chattanooga and take your chances of meeting me.Yours truly,

                  W. T. SHERMAN, Major General.One night--at Cheraw, I think it was--he sent for me to talk to him.I
found him lying on a bed of Spanish moss they had made for him.He asked
me a great many questions about St.Brinsmade,
especially his management of the Sanitary Commission."Brice," he said, after a while, "you remember when Grant sent me to
beat off Joe Johnston's army from Vicksburg.You were wounded then, by
the way, in that dash Lauman made.Grant thought he ought to warn me
against Johnston."'He's wily, Sherman,' said he."'Grant,' said I, 'you give me men enough and time enough to look over
the ground, and I'm not afraid of the devil.'"Nothing could sum up the man better than that.And now what a trick of
fate it is that he has Johnston before him again, in what we hope will
prove the last gasp of the war!He likes Johnston, by the way, and has
the greatest respect for him.I wish you could have peeped into our camp once in a while.In the rare
bursts of sunshine on this march our premises have been decorated with
gay red blankets, and sombre gray ones brought from the quartermasters,
and white Hudson's Bay blankets (not so white now), all being between
forked sticks.It is wonderful how the pitching of a few tents, and the
busy crackle of a few fires, and the sound of voices--sometimes merry,
sometimes sad, depending on the weather, will change the look of a
lonely pine knoll.I should be heartily ashamed
if a word of complaint ever fell from my lips.Whenever I
wake up at night with my feet in a puddle between the blankets, I think
of the men.The corduroy roads which our horses stumble over through the
mud, they make as well as march on.Our flies are carried in wagons,
and our utensils and provisions.They must often bear on their backs the
little dog-tents, under which, put up by their own labor, they crawl
to sleep, wrapped in a blanket they have carried all day, perhaps waist
deep in water.The food they eat has been in their haversacks for many a
weary mile, and is cooked in the little skillet and pot which have
also been a part of their burden.Then they have their musket and
accoutrements, and the "forty rounds" at their backs.Patiently,
cheerily tramping along, going they know not where, nor care much
either, so it be not in retreat.Ready to make roads, throw up works,
tear up railroads, or hew out and build wooden bridges; or, best of all,
to go for the Johnnies under hot sun or heavy rain, through swamp and
mire and quicksand.They marched ten miles to storm Fort McAllister.And
how the cheers broke from them when the pop pop pop of the skirmish line
began after we came in sight of Savannah!No man who has seen but not
shared their life may talk of personal hardship.We arrived at this pretty little town yesterday, so effecting a junction
with Schofield, who got in with the 3d Corps the day before.I am
writing at General Schofield's headquarters.There was a bit of a battle
on Tuesday at Bentonville, and we have come hither in smoke, as usual.But this time we thank Heaven that it is not the smoke of burning
homes,--only some resin the "Johnnies" set on fire before they left.ON BOARD DESPATCH BOAT "MARTIN."DEAR MOTHER: A most curious thing has happened.But I may as well begin
at the beginning.When I stopped writing last evening at the summons
of the General, I was about to tell you something of the battle of
Bentonville on Tuesday last.Mower charged through as bad a piece
of wood and swamp as I ever saw, and got within one hundred yards of
Johnston himself, who was at the bridge across Mill Creek.Of course we
did not know this at the time, and learned it from prisoners.As I have written you, I have been under fire very little since coming
to the staff.When the battle opened, however, I saw that if I stayed
with the General (who was then behind the reserves) I would see little
or nothing; I went ahead "to get information" beyond the line of battle
into the woods.I did not find these favorable to landscape views, and
just as I was turning my horse back again I caught sight of a commotion
some distance to my right.The Rebel skirmish line had fallen back just
that instant, two of our skirmishers were grappling with a third man,
who was fighting desperately.It struck me as singular that the fellow
was not in gray, but had on some sort of dark clothes.I could not reach them in the swamp on horseback, and was in the act of
dismounting when the man fell, and then they set out to carry him to the
rear, still farther to my right, beyond the swamp.I shouted, and one of
the skirmishers came up."We've got a spy, sir," he said excitedly.He was hid in the thicket yonder, lying flat on his face.He reckoned that our boys would run right over him and that he'd get
into our lines that way.Tim Foley stumbled on him, and he put up as
good a fight with his fists as any man I ever saw."That night I told the General, who
sent over to the headquarters of the 17th Corps to inquire.The word
came back that the man's name was Addison, and he claimed to be a Union
sympathizer who owned a plantation near by.He declared that he had been
conscripted by the Rebels, wounded, sent back home, and was now about to
be pressed in again.He had taken this method of escaping to our lines.It was a common story enough, but General Mower added in his message
that he thought the story fishy.This was because the man's appearance
was very striking, and he seemed the type of Confederate fighter who
would do and dare anything.He had a wound, which had been a bad one,
evidently got from a piece of shell.But they had been able to find
nothing on him.Sherman sent back word to keep the man until he could
see him in person.It was about nine o'clock last night when I reached
the house the General has taken.A prisoner's guard was resting outside,
and the hall was full of officers.They said that the General was
awaiting me, and pointed to the closed door of a room that had been the
dining room.Two candles were burning in pewter sticks on the bare mahogany table.There was the General sitting beside them, with his legs crossed,
holding some crumpled tissue paper very near his eyes, and reading.He
did not look up when I entered.I was aware of a man standing, tall and
straight, just out of range of the candles' rays.He wore the easy dress
of a Southern planter, with the broad felt hat.The head was flung back
so that there was just a patch of light on the chin, and the lids of the
eyes in the shadow were half closed.For the moment I felt precisely as I
had when I was hit by that bullet in Lauman's charge.I was aware of
something very like pain, yet I could not place the cause of it.But
this is what since has made me feel queer: you doubtless remember
staying at Hollingdean, when I was a boy, and hearing the story of Lord
Northwell's daredevil Royalist ancestor,--the one with the lace collar
over the dull-gold velvet, and the pointed chin, and the lazy scorn in
the eyes.Those eyes are painted with drooping lids.The first time I
saw Clarence Colfax I thought of that picture--and now I thought of the
picture first."Major Brice, do you know this gentleman?""His name is Colfax, sir--Colonel Colfax, I think"

"Thought so," said the General.I have thought much of that scene since, as I am steaming northward over
green seas and under cloudless skies, and it has seemed very unreal.I
should almost say supernatural when I reflect how I have run across this
man again and again, and always opposing him.I can recall just how he
looked at the slave auction, which seem, so long ago: very handsome,
very boyish, and yet with the air of one to be deferred to.It was
sufficiently remarkable that I should have found him in Vicksburg.But
now--to be brought face to face with him in this old dining room in
Goldsboro!I did not know how he
would act, but I went up to him and held out my hand, and said.--"How do
you do, Colonel Colfax?"I am sure that my voice was not very steady, for I cannot help liking
him And then his face lighted up and he gave me his hand.And he smiled
at me and again at the General, as much as to say that it was all over."We seem to run into each other, Major Brice," said he.I could see that the General, too,
was moved, from the way he looked at him.And he speaks a little more
abruptly at such times."Guess that settles it, Colonel," he said."I reckon it does, General," said Clarence, still smiling.The General
turned from him to the table with a kind of jerk and clapped his hand on
the tissue paper."These speak for themselves, sir," he said."It is very plain that they
would have reached the prominent citizens for whom they were intended if
you had succeeded in your enterprise.You were captured out of uniform
You know enough of war to appreciate the risk you ran."Call Captain Vaughan, Brice, and ask him to conduct the prisoner back."I asked him if I could write home for him or do anything else.Some day I shall tell you what he said.Then Vaughan took him out, and I heard the guard shoulder arms and tramp
away in the night.The General and I were left alone with the mahogany
table between us, and a family portrait of somebody looking down on
us from the shadow on the wall.A moist spring air came in at the open
windows, and the candles flickered.After a silence, I ventured to say:

"I hope he won't be shot, General.""Don't know, Brice," he answered.Hate to shoot him,
but war is war.Magnificent class he belongs to--pity we should have to
fight those fellows."He paused, and drummed on the table."Brice," said he, "I'm going to
send you to General Grant at City Point with despatches.I'm sorry Dunn
went back yesterday, but it can't be helped."You'll have to ride to Kinston.The railroad won't be through until
to-morrow: I'll telegraph there, and to General Easton at Morehead City.Tell Grant I expect to run up there in a
day or two myself, when things are arranged here.I turned to go, but Clarence Colfax was on my mind "General?""General, could you hold Colonel Colfax until I see you again?"It was a bold thing to say, and I quaked.And he looked at me in his
keen way, through and through "You saved his life once before, didn't
you?""You allowed me to have him sent home from Vicksburg, sir."He answered with one of his jokes--apropos of something he said on the
Court House steps at Vicksburg."Well, well," he said, "I'll see, I'll see.Thank God this war is pretty
near over.I'll let you know, Brice, before I shoot him."I rode the thirty odd miles to Kinston in--little more than three hours.A locomotive was waiting for me, and I jumped into a cab with a friendly
engineer.Soon we were roaring seaward through the vast pine forests.It was a lonely journey, and you were much in my mind.My greatest
apprehension was that we might be derailed and the despatches captured;
for as fast as our army had advanced, the track of it had closed again,
like the wake of a ship at sea.Guerillas were roving about, tearing up
ties and destroying bridges.There was one five-minute interval of excitement when, far down the
tunnel through the forest, we saw a light gleaming.The engineer said
there was no house there, that it must be a fire.But we did not slacken
our speed, and gradually the leaping flames grew larger and redder until
we were upon them.Not one gaunt figure stood between them and us.Not one shot broke the
stillness of the night.As dawn broke I beheld the flat, gray waters of
the Sound stretching away to the eastward, and there was the boat at the
desolate wharf beside the warehouse, her steam rising white in the chill
morning air.THE SAME, CONTINUED

             HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,
              CITY POINT, VIRGINIA, March 28, 1865.DEAR MOTHER: I arrived here safely the day before yesterday, and I hope
that you will soon receive some of the letters I forwarded on that day.It is an extraordinary place, this City Point; a military city sprung up
like a mushroom in a winter.And my breath was quite taken away when I
first caught sight of it on the high table-land.The great bay in front
of it, which the Appomattox helps to make, is a maze of rigging and
smoke-pipes, like the harbor of a prosperous seaport.There are gunboats
and supply boats, schooners and square-riggers and steamers, all huddled
together, and our captain pointed out to me the 'Malvern' flying Admiral
Porter's flag.Barges were tied up at the long wharves, and these were
piled high with wares and flanked by squat warehouses.Although it
was Sunday, a locomotive was puffing and panting along the foot of the
ragged bank.High above, on the flat promontory between the two rivers, is the city
of tents and wooden huts, the great trees in their fresh faint green
towering above the low roofs.At the point of the bluff a large flag
drooped against its staff, and I did not have to be told that this was
General Grant's headquarters.There was a fine steamboat lying at the wharf, and I had hardly stepped
ashore before they told me she was President Lincoln's.I read the name
on her--the 'River Queen'.Yes, the President is here, too, with his
wife and family.There are many fellows here with whom I was brought up in Boston.I am
living with Jack Hancock, whom you will remember well.He is a captain
now, and has a beard.I went straight to General Grant's
headquarters,--just a plain, rough slat house such as a contractor might
build for a temporary residence.Only the high flagstaff and the Stars
and Stripes distinguish it from many others of the same kind.A group of
officers stood chatting outside of it, and they told me that the General
had walked over to get his mail.He is just as unassuming and democratic
as "my general."General Rankin took me into the office, a rude room,
and we sat down at the long table there.Presently the door opened,
and a man came in with a slouch hat on and his coat unbuttoned.We rose to our feet, and I saluted."General, this is Major Brice of General Sherman's staff.He has brought
despatches from Goldsboro," said Rankin.He nodded, took off his hat and laid it on the table, and reached out
for the despatches.While reading them he did not move, except to light
another cigar.I am getting hardened to unrealities,--perhaps I should
say marvels, now.It did not seem so
strange that this silent General with the baggy trousers was the man who
had risen by leaps and bounds in four years to be general-in-chief of
our armies.His face looks older and more sunken than it did on that
day in the street near the Arsenal, in St.Louis, when he was just a
military carpet-bagger out of a job.But
how different the impressions made by the man in authority and the same
man out of authority!He made a sufficient impression upon me then, as I told you at the time.That was because I overheard his well-merited rebuke to Hopper.But I
little dreamed that I was looking on the man who was to come out of the
West and save this country from disunion.And how quietly and simply he
has done it, without parade or pomp or vainglory.Of all those who, with
every means at their disposal, have tried to conquer Lee, he is the
only one who has in any manner succeeded.He has been able to hold him
fettered while Sherman has swept the Confederacy.And these are the two
men who were unknown when the war began.When the General had finished reading the despatches, he folded them
quickly and put them in his pocket."Sit down and tell me about this last campaign of yours, Major," he
said.I talked with him for about half an hour.He is a marked contrast to Sherman in this respect.I believe that
he only opened his lips to ask two questions.You may well believe that
they were worth the asking, and they revealed an intimate knowledge of
our march from Savannah.I was interrupted many times by the arrival
of different generals, aides, etc.He sat there smoking, imperturbable.Sometimes he said "yes" or "no," but oftener he merely nodded his head.Once he astounded by a brief question an excitable young lieutenant, who
floundered.The General seemed to know more than he about the matter he
had in hand.When I left him, he asked me where I was quartered, and said he hoped I
would be comfortable.Jack Hancock was waiting for me, and we walked around the city, which
even has barber shops.Everywhere were signs of preparation, for the
roads are getting dry, and the General preparing for a final campaign
against Lee.What a marvellous fight he has made with his
material.I think that he will be reckoned among the greatest generals
of our race.Of course, I was very anxious to get a glimpse of the President, and
so we went down to the wharf, where we heard that he had gone off for
a horseback ride.They say that he rides nearly every day, over the
corduroy roads and through the swamps, and wherever the boys see that
tall hat they cheer.They know it as well as the lookout tower on the
flats of Bermuda Hundred.He lingers at the campfires and swaps stories
with the officers, and entertains the sick and wounded in the hospitals.I believe that the great men don't change.Away with your Napoleons and your Marlboroughs and your Stuarts.These
are the days of simple men who command by force of character, as well as
knowledge.I believe that he will change the
world, and strip it of its vainglory and hypocrisy.In the evening, as we were sitting around Hancock's fire, an officer
came in."The President sends his compliments, Major, and wants to know if you
would care to pay him a little visit."If I would care to pay him a little visit!That officer had to hurry to
keep up with the as I walked to the wharf.He led me aboard the River
Queen, and stopped at the door of the after-cabin.Lincoln was sitting under the lamp, slouched down in his chair,
in the position I remembered so well.It was as if I had left him but
yesterday.He was whittling, and he had made some little toy for his son
Tad, who ran out as I entered.When he saw me, the President rose to his great height, a sombre,
towering figure in black.But the sad
smile, the kindly eyes in their dark caverns, the voice--all were just
the same.It was sad and lined
when I had known it, but now all the agony endured by the millions,
North and South, seemed written on it.I took his big, bony hand,
which reminded me of Judge Whipple's.Yes, it was just as if I had been
with him always, and he were still the gaunt country lawyer."Yes, sir," I said, "indeed I do."He looked at me with that queer expression of mirth he sometimes has.I didn't
think that any man could travel so close to Sherman and keep 'em.""They're unfortunate ways, sir," I said, "if they lead you to misjudge
me."He laid his hand on my shoulder, just as he had done at Freeport."I know you, Steve," he said."I shuck an ear of corn before I buy it.I've kept tab on you a little the last five years, and when I heard
Sherman had sent a Major Brice up here, I sent for you.""I tried very hard to get a glimpse of you
to-day, Mr."I'm glad to hear it, Steve," he said."Then you haven't joined the
ranks of the grumblers?You haven't been one of those who would have
liked to try running this country for a day or two, just to show me how
to do it?""No, sir," I said, laughing."I didn't think you were that kind,
Steve.Now sit down and tell me about this General of mine who wears
seven-leagued boots.What was it--four hundred and twenty miles in fifty
days?How many navigable rivers did he step across?"He began to count
on those long fingers of his."The Edisto, the Broad, the Catawba, the
Pedee, and--?""Is--is the General a nice man?""Yes, sir, he is that," I answered heartily."And not a man in the
army wants anything when he is around.You should see that Army of the
Mississippi, sir.They arrived in Goldsboro' in splendid condition."He got up and gathered his coat-tails under his arms, and began to walk
up and down the cabin.And, thinking the story of the white socks
might amuse him, I told him that."Well, now," he said, "any man that has a nickname like that is all
right.That's the best recommendation you can give the General--just
say 'Uncle Billy.'""You've given 'Uncle
Billy' a good recommendation, Steve," he said."Did you ever hear the
story of Mr."Well, when Wallace was hiring his gardener he asked him whom he had
been living with."'A ricommindation is it, sorr?Sure I have nothing agin Misther
Dalton, though he moightn't be knowing just the respict the likes of a
first-class garthener is entitled to.'"He seldom does, it seems, at his own stories.But
I could not help laughing over the "ricommindation" I had given the
General.He knew that I was embarrassed, and said kindly:-- "Now tell
me something about 'Uncle Billy's <DW15>s.'I hear that they have a most
effectual way of tearing up railroads."I told him of Poe's contrivance of the hook and chain, and how the
heaviest rails were easily overturned with it, and how the ties were
piled and fired and the rails twisted out of shape.The President
listened to every word with intense interest.he exclaimed, "we have got a general.Caesar burnt his
bridges behind him, but Sherman burns his rails.Then I began to tell him how
the <DW64>s had flocked into our camps, and how simply and plainly the
General had talked to them, advising them against violence of any kind,
and explaining to them that "Freedom" meant only the liberty to earn
their own living in their own way, and not freedom from work."We have got a general, sure enough," he cried."He talks to them
plainly, does he, so that they understand?I say to you, Brice," he went
on earnestly, "the importance of plain talk can't be overestimated.Any
thought, however abstruse, can be put in speech that a boy or a
<DW64> can grasp.Any book, however deep, can be written in terms that
everybody can comprehend, if a man only tries hard enough.When I was a
boy I used to hear the neighbors talking, and it bothered me so because
I could not understand them that I used to sit up half the night
thinking things out for myself.I remember that I did not know what the
word demonstrate meant.So I stopped my studies then and there and got a
volume of Euclid.Before I got through I could demonstrate everything in
it, and I have never been bothered with demonstrate since."I thought of those wonderfully limpid speeches of his: of the Freeport
debates, and of the contrast between his style and Douglas's.And I
understood the reason for it at last.I understood the supreme mind that
had conceived the Freeport Question.And as I stood before him then, at
the close of this fearful war, the words of the Gospel were in my mind.'So the last shall be first, and the first, last; for many be called,
but few chosen.'How I wished that all those who have maligned and tortured him could
talk with him as I had talked with him.To know his great heart would
disarm them of all antagonism.They would feel, as I feel, that his life
is so much nobler than theirs, and his burdens so much heavier, that
they would go away ashamed of their criticism.He said to me once, "Brice, I hope we are in sight of the end, now.I
hope that we may get through without any more fighting.I don't want to
see any more of our countrymen killed.And then," he said, as if talking
to himself, "and then we must show them mercy--mercy."I thought it a good time to mention Colfax's case.He has been on my
mind ever since.Once he sighed, and
he was winding his long fingers around each other while I talked.Lincoln," I concluded, "And if a
technicality will help him out, he was actually within his own skirmish
line at the time.The Rebel skirmishers had not fallen back on each side
of him.""Brice," he said, with that sorrowful smile, "a technicality might save
Colfax, but it won't save me.And I went on to tell of what he had done at Vicksburg, leaving
out, however, my instrumentality in having him sent north.(That seems to be a favorite expression of
his.)If it wasn't for them, the
South would have quit long ago."Then he looked at me in his funny way,
and said, "See here, Steve, if this Colfax isn't exactly a friend of
yours, there must be some reason why you are pleading for him in this
way.""Well, sir," I said, at length, "I should like to get him off on account
of his cousin, Miss Virginia Carvel.And I told him something about
Miss Carvel, and how she had helped you with the Union sergeant that day
in the hot hospital.And how she had nursed Judge Whipple.""She's a fine woman," he said."Those women have helped those men to
prolong this war about three years.""And yet we must save them for the nation's sake.They are to be the
mothers of our patriots in days to come.Is she a friend of yours, too,
Steve?""Not especially, sir," I answered finally."I have had to offend her
rather often.he cried, jumping up, "she's a daughter of Colonel Carvel.I
always had an admiration for that man.An ideal Southern gentleman of
the old school,--courteous, as honorable and open as the day, and as
brave as a lion.You've heard the story of how he threw a man named
Babcock out of his store, who tried to bribe him?""I heard you tell it in that tavern, sir.It
did me good to hear the Colonel praised."I always liked that story," he said."By the way, what's become of the
Colonel?""He got away--South, sir," I answered.He hasn't
been heard of since the summer of '63.And so
you want me to pardon this Colfax?""It would be presumptuous in me to go that far, sir," I replied."But I
hoped you might speak of it to the General when he comes.And I would be
glad of the opportunity to testify."He took a few strides up and down the room."Well, well," he said, "that's my vice--pardoning, saying yes.It's
always one more drink with me.It--" he smiled--"it makes me sleep
better.I've pardoned enough Rebels to populate New Orleans.Why," he
continued, with his whimsical look, "just before I left Washington, in
comes one of your Missouri senators with a list of Rebels who are shut
up in McDowell's and Alton.I said:-- "'Senator, you're not going to ask
me to turn loose all those at once?'"He said just what you said when you were speaking of Missouri a while
ago, that he was afraid of guerilla warfare, and that the war was nearly
over.And then what does he do but pull out another batch
longer than the first!you don't want me to turn these loose, too?'I think it will pay to be merciful.'"'Then durned if I don't,' I said, and I signed 'em."STEAMER "RIVER QUEEN."ON THE POTOMAC, April 9, 1865.DEAR MOTHER: I am glad that the telegrams I have been able to send
reached you safely.I have not had time to write, and this will be but a
short letter.I am on the President's boat,
in the President's party, bound with him for Washington.And this is how
it happened: The very afternoon of the day I wrote you, General Sherman
himself arrived at City Point on the steamer 'Russia'.I heard the
salutes, and was on the wharf to meet him.That same afternoon he and
General Grant and Admiral Porter went aboard the River Queen to see
the President.How I should have liked to be present at that interview!After it was over they all came out of the cabin together General Grant
silent, and smoking, as usual; General Sherman talking vivaciously;
and Lincoln and the Admiral smiling and listening.I shall never expect to see such a sight again in all my days.You
can imagine my surprise when the President called me from where I was
standing at some distance with the other officers.He put his hand on my
shoulder then and there, and turned to General Sherman."Major Brice is a friend of mine, General," he said."He never told me that," said the General."I guess he's got a great many important things shut up inside of him,"
said Mr."But he gave you a good recommendation,
Sherman.He said that you wore white socks, and that the boys liked
you and called you 'Uncle Billy.'And I told him that was the best
recommendation he could give anybody."But the General only looked at me with those eyes that
go through everything, and then he laughed."Brice," he said, "You'll have my reputation ruined."Lincoln, "you don't want the Major right away, do
you?Let him stay around here for a while with me.He looked at the general-in-chief, who was smiling just
a little bit."I've got a sneaking notion that Grant's going to do
something."Lincoln," said my General, "you may have Brice.Be
careful he doesn't talk you to death--he's said too much already."I have no time now to tell you all that I have seen and heard.I have
ridden with the President, and have gone with him on errands of mercy
and errands of cheer.I have been almost within sight of what we hope is
the last struggle of this frightful war.I have listened to the guns of
Five Forks, where Sheridan and Warren bore their own colors in the front
of the charge, I was with Mr.Lincoln while the battle of Petersburg was
raging, and there were tears in his eyes.Then came the retreat of Lee and the instant pursuit of Grant,
and--Richmond.The quiet General did not so much as turn aside to enter
the smoking city he had besieged for so long.But I went there, with the
President.And if I had one incident in my life to live over again, I
should choose this.As we were going up the river, a disabled steamer
lay across the passage in the obstruction of piles the Confederates had
built.There were but a few of us in his
party, and we stepped into Admiral Porter's twelve-oared barge and were
rowed to Richmond, the smoke of the fires still darkening the sky.We
landed within a block of Libby Prison.With the little guard of ten sailors he marched the mile and a half
to General Weitzel's headquarters,--the presidential mansion of the
Confederacy.I shall remember him always as
I saw him that day, a tall, black figure of sorrow, with the high silk
hat we have learned to love.Unafraid, his heart rent with pity, he
walked unharmed amid such tumult as I have rarely seen.The windows
filled, the streets ahead of us became choked, as the word that the
President was coming ran on like quick-fire.The <DW64>s wept aloud and cried
hosannas.They pressed upon him that they might touch the hem of his
coat, and one threw himself on his knees and kissed the President's
feet.Still he walked on unharmed, past the ashes and the ruins.Not as a
conqueror was he come, to march in triumph.Though there were many times when we had to fight for a path through the
crowds, he did not seem to feel the danger.Was it because he knew that his hour was not yet come?To-day, on the boat, as we were steaming between the green shores of the
Potomac, I overheard him reading to Mr.Sumner:--

          "Duncan is in his grave;
        After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;
        Treason has done his worst; nor steel, nor poison,
        Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
        Can touch him further."WILLARD'S HOTEL, WASHINGTON, April 10, 1865.I have looked up the passage, and have written it in above.MAN OF SORROW

The train was late--very late.It was Virginia who first caught sight
of the new dome of the Capitol through the slanting rain, but she merely
pressed her lips together and said nothing.In the dingy brick station
of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad more than one person paused to look
after them, and a kind-hearted lady who had been in the car kissed the
girl good-by."You think that you can find your uncle's house, my dear?"she asked,
glancing at Virginia with concern.Through all of that long journey she
had worn a look apart."Do you think you can find your uncle's house?"And then she smiled as she looked at the honest,
alert, and squarely built gentleman beside her.Whereupon the kind lady gave the Captain her hand."You look as if you
could, Captain," said she."Remember, if General Carvel is out of town,
you promised to bring her to me.""Yes, ma'am," said Captain Lige, "and so I shall."No sah, dat ain't de kerridge
you wants.Dat's it, lady, you'se lookin at it.Kerridge, kerridge,
kerridge!"Virginia tried bravely to smile, but she was very near to tears as she
stood on the uneven pavement and looked at the scrawny horses standing
patiently in the steady downpour.All sorts of people were coming
and going, army officers and navy officers and citizens of states and
territories, driving up and driving away.She was thinking then of the multitude who came here with aching
hearts,--with heavier hearts than was hers that day.How many of the
throng hurrying by would not flee, if they could, back to the peaceful
homes they had left?Destroyed,
like her own, by the war.Women with children at their breasts, and
mothers bowed with sorrow, had sought this city in their agony.Young
men and old had come hither, striving to keep back the thoughts of dear
ones left behind, whom they might never see again.And by the thousands
and tens of thousands they had passed from here to the places of blood
beyond."Do you know where General Daniel Carvel lives?""Yes, sah, reckon I does.Virginia sank back on the stuffy cushions of the rattle-trap, and then
sat upright again and stared out of the window at the dismal scene.They
were splashing through a sea of mud.Louis,
Captain Lige had done his best to cheer her, and he did not intend to
desist now."So this is Washington, Why, it don't
compare to St.Louis, except we haven't got the White House and the
Capitol.Jinny, it would take a scow to get across the street, and we
don't have ramshackly stores and <DW65> cabins bang up against fine
Houses like that.We don't
have any dirty pickaninnies dodging among the horses in our residence
streets.I declare, Jinny, if those aren't pigs!""I hope Uncle Daniel has some breakfast for you.You've had a good deal to put up with on this trip.""Lordy, Jinny," said the Captain, "I'd put up with a good deal more than
this for the sake of going anywhere with you.""Even to such a doleful place as this?""This is all right, if the sun'll only come out and dry things up and
let us see the green on those trees," he said, "Lordy, how I do love to
see the spring green in the sunlight!""Lige," she said, "you know you're just trying to keep up my spirits.You've been doing that ever since we left home.""No such thing," he replied with vehemence."There's nothing for you to
be cast down about.""Suppose I can't make your Black
Republican President pardon Clarence!"said the Captain, squeezing her hand and trying to appear
unconcerned.Just then the rattletrap pulled up at the sidewalk, the wheels of the
near side in four inches of mud, and the Captain leaped out and spread
the umbrella.They were in front of a rather imposing house of brick,
flanked on one side by a house just like it, and on the other by a
series of dreary vacant lots where the rain had collected in pools.They
climbed the steps and rang the bell.In due time the door was opened by
a smiling yellow butler in black."Yas, miss, But he ain't to home now."Didn't he get my telegram day before
yesterday?"He's done gone since Saturday, miss."And then, evidently impressed by
the young lady's looks, he added hospitably, "Kin I do anything fo' you,
miss?""I'm his niece, Miss Virginia Carvel, and this is Captain Brent."The yellow butler's face lighted up."Come right in, Miss Jinny, Done heerd de General speak of you
often--yas'm.De General'll be to home dis a'ternoon, suah.'Twill do
him good ter see you, Miss Jinny.Walk right
in, Cap'n, and make yo'selves at home.Lizbeth--Lizbeth!"Done seed her at
Calve't House."Very well, Lizbeth," said Virginia, listlessly sitting down on the hall
sofa."Yas'm," said Lizbeth, "jes' reckon we kin."She ushered them into a
walnut dining room, big and high and sombre, with plush-bottomed chairs
placed about--walnut also; for that was the fashion in those days.But the Captain had no sooner seated himself than he shot up again and
started out."To pay off the carriage driver," he said."I'm going to the White House in a little
while.""To see your Black Republican President," she replied, with alarming
calmness."Now, Jinny," he cried, in excited appeal, "don't go doin' any such fool
trick as that.Your Uncle Dan'l will be here this afternoon.And then the thing'll be fixed all right, and no
mistake."Her reply was in the same tone--almost a monotone--which she had used
for three days.It made the Captain very uneasy, for he knew when she
spoke in that way that her will was in it."And to lose that time," she answered, "may be to have him shot.""But you can't get to the President without credentials," he objected."What," she flashed, "hasn't any one a right to see the President?You
mean to say that he will not see a woman in trouble?Then all these
pretty stories I hear of him are false.They are made up by the
Yankees."He had some notion of the multitude of calls upon Mr.But he could not, he dared not,
remind her of the principal reason for this,--Lee's surrender and the
approaching end of the war.In the distant valley of the Mississippi he had only heard of
the President very conflicting things.He had heard him criticised and
reviled and praised, just as is every man who goes to the White House,
be he saint or sinner.And, during an administration, no man at a
distance may come at a President's true character and worth.The Captain
had seen Lincoln caricatured vilely.And again he had read and heard the
pleasant anecdotes of which Virginia had spoken, until he did not know
what to believe.As for Virginia, he knew her partisanship to, and undying love for, the
South; he knew the class prejudice which was bound to assert itself, and
he had seen enough in the girl's demeanor to fear that she was going to
demand rather than implore.She did not come of a race that was wont to
bend the knee."Well, well," he said despairingly, "you must eat some breakfast first,
Jinny."She waited with an ominous calmness until it was brought in, and then
she took a part of a roll and some coffee."This won't do," exclaimed the Captain."Why, why, that won't get you
halfway to Mr."You must eat enough, Lige," she said.He was finished in an incredibly short time, and amid the protestations
of Lizbeth and the yellow butler they got into the carriage again, and
splashed and rattled toward the White House.Once Virginia glanced out,
and catching sight of the bedraggled flags on the houses in honor of
Lee's surrender, a look of pain crossed her face.The Captain could not
repress a note of warning."Jinny," said he, "I have an idea that you'll find the President a good
deal of a man.Now if you're allowed to see him, don't get him mad,
Jinny, whatever you do.""If he is something of a man, Lige, he will not lose his temper with a
woman."And just then they came in sight of the house of
the Presidents, with its beautiful portico and its broad wings.And they
turned in under the dripping trees of the grounds.A carriage with a
black coachman and footman was ahead of them, and they saw two stately
gentlemen descend from it and pass the guard at the door.The Captain helped her out in his best manner, and gave some
money to the driver."I reckon he needn't wait for us this time, Jinny," said be.She shook
her head and went in, he following, and they were directed to the
anteroom of the President's office on the second floor.There were
many people in the corridors, and one or two young officers in blue who
stared at her.But her spirits sank when they came to the anteroom.It was full of all
sorts of people.Politicians, both prosperous and seedy, full faced and
keen faced, seeking office; women, officers, and a one-armed soldier
sitting in the corner.He was among the men who offered Virginia their
seats, and the only one whom she thanked.But she walked directly to the
doorkeeper at the end of the room."Then you'll have to wait your turn, sir," he said, shaking his head and
looking at Virginia."It's slow work waiting your turn,
there's so many governors and generals and senators, although the
session's over.And added, with an inspiration,
"I must see him.She saw instantly, with a woman's instinct, that these words had had
their effect.The old man glanced at her again, as if demurring."You're sure, miss, it's life and death?""Oh, why should I say so if it were not?""The orders are very strict," he said."But the President told me to
give precedence to cases when a life is in question.Just you wait a
minute, miss, until Governor Doddridge comes out, and I'll see what I
can do for you.In a little while the heavy door
opened, and a portly, rubicund man came out with a smile on his face.He broke into a laugh, when halfway across the room, as if the memory of
what he had heard were too much for his gravity.The doorkeeper slipped
into the room, and there was a silent, anxious interval.Captain Lige started forward with her, but she restrained him."Wait for me here, Lige," she said.She swept in alone, and the door closed softly after her.The room was
a big one, and there were maps on the table, with pins sticking in them.Could this fantastically tall, stooping figure before her be that of the
President of the United States?She stopped, as from the shock he gave
her.The lean, yellow face with the mask-like lines all up and down,
the unkempt, tousled hair, the beard--why, he was a hundred times more
ridiculous than his caricatures.He might have stood for many of the
poor white trash farmers she had seen in Kentucky--save for the long
black coat.Somehow that smile changed his face a
little."I guess I'll have to own up," he answered."My name is Virginia Carvel," she said."I have come all the way from
St."Miss Carvel," said the President, looking at her intently, "I have
rarely been so flattered in my life.I--I hope I have not disappointed
you.""Oh, you haven't," she cried, her eyes flashing, "because I am what you
would call a Rebel."The mirth in the dark corners of his eyes disturbed her more and more.And then she saw that the President was laughing."And have you a better name for it, Miss Carvel?""Because I
am searching for a better name--just now.""No, thank you," said Virginia; "I think that I can say what I have come
to say better standing."That reminds me of a story they tell
about General Buck Tanner.One day the
boys asked him over to the square to make a speech."'I'm all right when I get standing up, Liza,' he said to his wife.Only trouble is they come too cussed fast.How'm I going to stop 'em when I want to?'"'Well, I du declare, Buck,' said she, 'I gave you credit for some
sense.All you've got to do is to set down."So the General went over to the square and talked for about an hour
and a half, and then a Chicago man shouted to him to dry up."'Boys,' said he, 'it's jest every bit as bad for me as it is for you.You'll have to hand up a chair, boys, because I'm never going to get
shet of this goldarned speech any anther way.'"Lincoln had told this so comically that Virginia was forced to
laugh, and she immediately hated herself.A man who could joke at such
a time certainly could not feel the cares and responsibilities of his
office.And yet this was the President
who had conducted the war, whose generals had conquered the Confederacy.And she was come to ask him a favor.Lincoln," she began, "I have come to talk to you about my cousin,
Colonel Clarence Colfax.""I shall be happy to talk to you about your cousin, Colonel Colfax, Miss
Carvel."He is my first cousin," she retorted."Why didn't he come
with you?""He is Clarence Colfax, of St.Louis, now a Colonel in the army of the Confederate States."Virginia tossed her head in
exasperation."In General Joseph Johnston's army," she replied, trying to be patient."But now," she gulped, "now he has been arrested as a spy by General
Sherman's army.""And--and they are going to shoot him.""Oh, no, he doesn't," she cried."You don't know how brave he is!He
floated down the Mississippi on a log, out of Vicksburg, and brought
back thousands and thousands of percussion caps.He rowed across the
river when the Yankee fleet was going down, and set fire to De Soto so
that they could see to shoot."Lincoln, "that's a good starter.""Miss Carvel," said he, "that argument reminds me of a story about a man
I used to know in the old days in Illinois.His name was McNeil, and he
was a lawyer."One day he was defending a prisoner for assault and battery before
Judge Drake."'Judge, says McNeil, 'you oughtn't to lock this man up.It was a fair
fight, and he's the best man in the state in a fair fight.And, what's
more, he's never been licked in a fair fight in his life.'"'And if your honor does lock me up,' the prisoner put in, 'I'll give
your honor a thunderin' big lickin' when I get out.'"'Gentlemen,' said he, 'it's a powerful queer argument, but the Court
will admit it on its merits.The prisoner will please to step out on the
grass.'"She was striving against
something, she knew not what.Her breath was coming deeply, and she was
dangerously near to tears.She had come into
this man's presence despising herself for having to ask him a favor.Now she could not look into it
without an odd sensation.Told her a few funny stories--given quizzical
answers to some of her questions.Quizzical, yes; but she could not be
sure then there was not wisdom in them, and that humiliated her.She had
never conceived of such a man.And, be it added gratuitously, Virginia
deemed herself something of an adept in dealing with men.Lincoln, "to continue for the defence, I believe
that Colonel Colfax first distinguished himself at the time of Camp
Jackson, when of all the prisoners he refused to accept a parole."Startled, she looked up at him swiftly, and then down again."Yes,"
she answered, "yes.Lincoln, please don't hold that against
him."If she could only have seen his face then."My dear young lady," replied the President, "I honor him for it.I was
merely elaborating the argument which you have begun.On the other hand,
it is a pity that he should have taken off that uniform which he adorned
and attempted to enter General Sherman's lines as a civilian,--as a
spy."He had spoken these last words very gently, but she was too excited to
heed his gentleness.She drew herself up, a gleam in her eyes like the
crest of a blue wave in a storm.she cried; "it takes more courage to be a spy than anything
else in war.You are not content in, the North
with what you have gained.You are not content with depriving us of
our rights, and our fortunes, with forcing us back to an allegiance we
despise.You are not content with humiliating our generals and putting
innocent men in prisons.But now I suppose you will shoot us all.And
all this mercy that I have heard about means nothing--nothing--"

Why did she falter and stop?"Miss Carvel," said the President, "I am afraid from what I have heard
just now, that it means nothing."Oh, the sadness of that voice,--the
ineffable sadness,--the sadness and the woe of a great nation!And the
sorrow in those eyes, the sorrow of a heavy cross borne meekly,--how
heavy none will ever know.The pain of a crown of thorns worn for a
world that did not understand.No wonder Virginia faltered and
was silent.She looked at Abraham Lincoln standing there, bent and
sorrowful, and it was as if a light had fallen upon him.But strangest
of all in that strange moment was that she felt his strength.It was the
same strength she had felt in Stephen Brice.This was the thought that
came to her.Slowly she walked to the window and looked out across the green grounds
where the wind was shaking the wet trees, past the unfinished monument
to the Father of her country, and across the broad Potomac to Alexandria
in the hazy distance.The rain beat upon the panes, and then she knew
that she was crying softly to herself.She had met a force that she
could not conquer, she had looked upon a sorrow that she could not
fathom, albeit she had known sorrow.She turned and looked through her tears
at his face that was all compassion."Tell me about your cousin," he said; "are you going to marry him?"But in
that moment she could not have spoken anything but the truth to save her
soul.Lincoln," she said; "I was--but I did not love him.I--I think
that was one reason why he was so reckless.""The officer who happened to see Colonel Colfax captured is now in
Washington.When your name was given to me, I sent for him.Perhaps he
is in the anteroom now.I should like to tell you, first of all, that
this officer defended your cousin and asked me to pardon him."He strode to the bell-cord, and spoke a few
words to the usher who answered his ring.Then the door opened, and a young officer, spare,
erect, came quickly into the room, and bowed respectfully to the
President.He saw her lips part and the
color come flooding into her face.The President sighed But the light in her eyes was reflected in his own.It has been truly said that Abraham Lincoln knew the human heart.The officer still stood facing the President, the girl staring at his
profile.Lincoln,
"when you asked me to pardon Colonel Colfax, I believe that you told me
he was inside his own skirmish lines when he was captured."Suddenly Stephen turned, as if impelled by the President's gaze, and so
his eyes met Virginia's.He forgot time and place,--for the while even
this man whom he revered above all men.He saw her hand tighten on the
arm of her chair.He took a step toward her, and stopped."He put in a plea, a lawyer's plea, wholly unworthy of him, Miss
Virginia.He asked me to let your cousin off on a technicality.Just the exclamation escaped her--nothing more.The
crimson that had betrayed her deepened on her cheeks.Slowly the eyes
she had yielded to Stephen came back again and rested on the President.And now her wonder was that an ugly man could be so beautiful.Lawyer," the President continued, "that I
am not letting off Colonel Colfax on a technicality.I am sparing his
life," he said slowly, "because the time for which we have been waiting
and longing for four years is now at hand--the time to be merciful.She crossed the room, her head lifted, her heart
lifted, to where this man of sorrows stood smiling down at her.Lincoln," she faltered, "I did not know you when I came here.I
should have known you, for I had heard him--I had heard Major Brice
praise you.Oh," she cried, "how I wish that every man and woman and
child in the South might come here and see you as I have seen you
to-day.I think--I think that some of their bitterness might be taken
away."Abraham Lincoln laid his hands upon the girl.And Stephen, watching,
knew that he was looking upon a benediction.Lincoln, "I have not suffered by the South, I have
suffered with the South.Your sorrow has been my sorrow, and your pain
has been my pain.And what you have
gained," he added sublimely, "I have gained."The clouds were flying before the wind,
and a patch of blue sky shone above the Potomac.With his long arm he
pointed across the river to the southeast, and as if by a miracle a
shaft of sunlight fell on the white houses of Alexandria."In the first days of the war," he said, "a flag flew there in sight of
the place where George Washington lived and died.I used to watch
that flag, and thank God that Washington had not lived to see it.And
sometimes, sometimes I wondered if God had allowed it to be put in irony
just there.""I should have known that this was our punishment--that the sight of
it was my punishment.Before we could become the great nation He has
destined us to be, our sins must be wiped out in blood."I say in all sincerity, may you always love it.May the day come when
this Nation, North and South, may look back upon it with reverence.Thousands upon thousands of brave Americans have died under it for what
they believed was right.But may the day come again when you will love
that flag you see there now--Washington's flag--better still."He stopped, and the tears were wet upon Virginia's lashes.Lincoln went over to his desk and sat down before it.Then he began
to write, slouched forward, one knee resting on the floor, his lips
moving at the same time.When he got up again he seemed taller than
ever.he said, "I guess that will fix it.I'll have that sent to
Sherman.I have already spoken to him about the matter."He turned to Stephen
with that quizzical look on his face he had so often seen him wear."Steve," he said, "I'll tell you a story.The other night Harlan was
here making a speech to a crowd out of the window, and my boy Tad was
sitting behind him."'No,' says Tad, 'hang on to 'em.'That is what we intend to do,--hang on to 'em.Lincoln, putting his hand again on Virginia's
shoulder, "if you have the sense I think you have, you'll hang on, too."For an instant he stood smiling at their blushes,--he to whom the power
was given to set apart his cares and his troubles and partake of the
happiness of others.he said, "I am ten
minutes behind my appointment at the Department.Miss Virginia, you may
care to thank the Major for the little service he has done you.You can
do so undisturbed here.As he opened the door he paused and looked back at them.The smile
passed from his face, and an ineffable expression of longing--longing
and tenderness--came upon it.For a space, while his spell was upon them, they did not stir.Then
Stephen sought her eyes that had been so long denied him.It was Virginia who first found her voice, and she
called him by his name."Oh, Stephen," she said, "how sad he looked!"He was close to her, at her side.And he answered her in the earnest
tone which she knew so well."Virginia, if I could have had what I most wished for in the world, I
should have asked that you should know Abraham Lincoln."Then she dropped her eyes, and her breath came quickly."I--I might have known," she answered, "I might have known what he was.I had seen him in you, and I did not know.Do you remember that day when we were in the summer-house together at
Glencoe, long ago?"You were changed then," she said bravely."When I saw him," said Stephen, reverently, "I knew how little and
narrow I was."Then, overcome by the incense of her presence, he drew her to him until
her heart beat against his own.She did not resist, but lifted her face
to him, and he kissed her."Yes, Stephen," she answered, low, more wonderful in her surrender than
ever before.Then she hid her face against his blue coat.Oh, Stephen, how I have struggled against it!How I have tried to hate you, and couldn't.I tried to
insult you, I did insult you.And when I saw how splendidly you bore it,
I used to cry.""I loved you through it all," he said.She raised her head quickly, and awe was in her eyes."Because I dreamed of you," he answered."And those dreams used to linger
with me half the day as I went about my work.I used to think of them as
I sat in the saddle on the march.""I, too, treasured them," she said.Faintly, "I have no one but you--now."Once more he drew her to him, and she gloried in his strength."God help me to cherish you, dear," he said, "and guard you well."She drew away from him, gently, and turned toward the window."See, Stephen," she cried, "the sun has come out at last."For a while they were silent, looking out; the drops glistened on blade
and leaf, and the joyous new green of the earth entered into their
hearts.ANNAPOLIS

IT was Virginia's wish, and was therefore sacred.As for Stephen, he
little cared whither they went.And so they found themselves on that
bright afternoon in mid-April under the great trees that arch the
unpaved streets of old Annapolis.They stopped by direction at a gate, and behind it was a green cluster
of lilac bushes, which lined the walk to the big plum- house
which Lionel Carvel had built.Virginia remembered that down this walk
on a certain day in June, a hundred years agone, Richard Carvel had led
Dorothy Manners.They climbed the steps, tottering now with age and disuse, and Virginia
playfully raised the big brass knocker, brown now, that Scipio had been
wont to polish until it shone.Stephen took from his pocket the clumsy
key that General Carvel had given him, and turned it in the rusty lock.The door swung open, and Virginia stood in the hall of her ancestors.It was musty and damp this day as the day when Richard had come back
from England and found it vacant and his grandfather dead.But there,
at the parting of the stairs, was the triple-arched window which he had
described.Through it the yellow afternoon light was flooding now, even
as then, checkered by the branches in their first fringe of green.But
the tall clock which Lionel Carvel used to wind was at Calvert House,
with many another treasure.They went up the stairs, and reverently they walked over the bare
floors, their footfalls echoing through the silent house.A score of
scenes in her great-grandfather's life came to Virginia.Here was the
room--the cornet one at the back of the main building, which looked out
over the deserted garden--that had been Richard's mother's.She recalled
how he had stolen into it on that summer's day after his return, and had
flung open the shutters.They were open now, for their locks were off.The prie-dieu was gone, and the dresser.But the high bed was there,
stripped of its poppy counterpane and white curtains; and the steps by
which she had entered it.And next they went into the great square room that had been Lionel
Carvel's, and there, too, was the roomy bed on which the old gentleman
had lain with the gout, while Richard read to him from the Spectator.One side of it looked out on the trees in Freshwater Lane; and the other
across the roof of the low house opposite to where the sun danced on the
blue and white waters of the Chesapeake."Honey," said Virginia, as they stood in the deep recess of the window,
"wouldn't it be nice if we could live here always, away from the world?But you would never be content to do that," she said,
smiling reproachfully."You are the kind of man who must be in the midst
of things.In a little while you will have far more besides me to think
about."He was quick to catch the note of sadness in her voice."We all have our duty to perform in the world, dear," he answered."To think that I should have married a
Puritan!What would my great-great-great-great-grandfather say, who was
such a stanch Royalist?Why, I think I can see him frowning at me now,
from the door, in his blue velvet goat and silverlaced waistcoat.""He was well punished," retorted Stephen, "his own grandson was a Whig,
and seems to have married a woman of spirit.""I am sure that she did not allow my
great-grandfather to kiss her--unless she wanted to."And she looked up at him, half smiling, half pouting; altogether
bewitching."From what I hear of him, he was something of a man," said Stephen."I am glad that Marlborough Street isn't a crowded thoroughfare," said
Virginia.When they had seen the dining room, with its carved mantel and silver
door-knobs, and the ballroom in the wing, they came out, and Stephen
locked the door again.They walked around the house, and stood looking
down the terraces,--once stately, but crumbled now,--where Dorothy had
danced on the green on Richard's birthday.Beyond and below was the
spring-house, and there was the place where the brook dived under the
ruined wall,--where Dorothy had wound into her hair the lilies of the
valley before she sailed for London.The remains of a wall that had once held a balustrade marked the
outlines of the formal garden.The trim hedges, for seventy years
neglected, had grown incontinent.The garden itself was full of wild
green things coming up through the brown of last season's growth.But
in the grass the blue violets nestled, and Virginia picked some of these
and put them in Stephen's coat."You must keep them always," she said, "because we got them here."They spied a seat beside a hoary trunk.There on many a spring day
Lionel Carvel had sat reading his Gazette.The sun hung low over the old-world gables in the street beyond the
wall, and in the level rays was an apple tree dazzling white, like a
bride.The sweet fragrance which the day draws from the earth lingered
in the air."Stephen, do you remember that fearful afternoon of the panic, when you
came over from Anne Brinsmade's to reassure me?""But what made you think of it now?"But you were so strong, so calm,
so sure of yourself.I think that made me angry when I thought how
ridiculous I must have been."But do
you know what I had under my arm--what I was saving of all the things I
owned?""No," he answered; "but I have often wondered.""This house--this place made me think of it.It was Dorothy Manners's
gown, and her necklace.They were all the
remembrance I had of that night at Mr.Brinsmade's gate, when we came so
near to each other.""Virginia," he said, "some force that we cannot understand has brought
us together, some force that we could not hinder.It is foolish for me
to say so, but on that day of the slave auction, when I first saw you,
I had a premonition about you that I have never admitted until now, even
to myself.""Why, Stephen," she cried, "I felt the same way!""And then," he continued quickly, "it was strange that I should have
gone to Judge Whipple, who was an intimate of your father's--such a
singular intimate.And then came your party, and Glencoe, and that
curious incident at the Fair.""When I was talking to the Prince, and looked up and saw you among all
those people.""That was the most uncomfortable of all, for me.""Stephen," she said, stirring the leaves at her feet, "you might have
taken me in your arms the night Judge Whipple died--if you had wanted
to.I love you all the more for
that."Again she said:-- "It was through your mother, dearest, that we were
most strongly drawn together.I worshipped her from the day I saw her in
the hospital.I believe that was the beginning of my charity toward the
North.""My mother would have chosen you above all women, Virginia," he
answered.In the morning came to them the news of Abraham Lincoln's death.And the
same thought was in both their hearts, who had known him as it was given
to few to know him.How he had lived in sorrow; how he had died a martyr
on the very day of Christ's death upon the cross.And they believed that
Abraham Lincoln gave his life for his country even as Christ gave his
for the world.And so must we believe that God has reserved for this Nation a destiny
high upon the earth.Many years afterward Stephen Brice read again to his wife those sublime
closing words of the second inaugural:--

   "With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the
   right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish
   the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him
   who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow and his children
   --to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace
   among ourselves and with all nations."AFTERWORD

The author has chosen St.Louis for the principal scene of this story
for many reasons.Grant and Sherman were living there before the Civil
War, and Abraham Lincoln was an unknown lawyer in the neighboring
state of Illinois.It has been one of the aims of this book to show the
remarkable contrasts in the lives of these great men who came out of the
West.Louis, which was founded by Laclede in 1765,
likewise became the principal meeting-place of two great streams of
emigration which had been separated, more or less, since Cromwell's day.To be sure, they were not all Cavaliers who settled in the tidewater
Colonies.There were Puritan settlements in both Maryland and Virginia.But the life in the Southern states took on the more liberal tinge which
had characterized that of the Royalists, even to the extent of affecting
the Scotch Calvinists, while the asceticism of the Roundheads was the
keynote of the Puritan character in New England.When this great country
of ours began to develop, the streams moved westward; one over what
became the plain states of Ohio and Indiana and Illinois, and the other
across the Blue Ridge Mountains into Kentucky and Tennessee.They mixed
along the line of the Ohio River.Louis, and, farther
west, in Kansas.The part played by
this people in the Civil War is a matter of history.The scope of this
book has not permitted the author to introduce the peasantry and trading
classes which formed the mass in this movement.But Richter, the type
of the university-bred revolutionist which emigrated after '48, is drawn
more or less from life.And the duel described actually took place in
Berlin.Louis is the author's birthplace, and his home, the home of those
friends whom he has known from childhood and who have always treated him
with unfaltering kindness.He begs that they will believe him when he
says that only such characters as he loves are reminiscent of those
he has known there.The city has a large population,--large enough to
include all the types that are to be found in the middle West.This book is written of a time when feeling ran high.It has been necessary to put strong speech into the mouths of the
characters.The breach that threatened our country's existence is healed
now.There is no side but Abraham Lincoln's side.And this side, with
all reverence and patriotism, the author has tried to take.Abraham Lincoln loved the South as well as the North.He looked them over, and shook his head.I'm wore ter ther bone--I'm a
wreck!Oh, it's a cursed life I've led sence they dragged me away from
har!Night an' day hev I watched for a chance ter break away, and' I war
quick ter grasp it when it came.They shot at me, an' one o' their
bullets cut my shoulder har.It war a close call, but I got away.Then
they follered, an' they put houn's arter me.Twenty times hev they been
right on me, an' twenty times hev I got erway.But it kep' wearin' me
weaker an' thinner.My last hope war ter find friends ter hide me an'
fight fer me, an' I came har--back home!I tried ter git inter 'Bije
Wileys' this mornin', but his dorg didn't know me, I war so changed, an'
ther hunters war close arter me, so I hed ter run fer it."exclaimed Barney; "we hearrud th' dog barruckin'.""So we did," agreed Frank, remembering how the creature had been
clamoring on the mountainside at daybreak."I kem har," continued the man, weakly."I turned on ther devils, but
when I run in har an' you-uns tackled me, I judged I had struck a trap.""It was no trap, Rufe Kenyon," said Frank, quietly.The hunted man started up and slunk away."An' still ye say you-uns are not my enemies.""No; but we have heard of you.""She saved us from certain death last night, and she brought us here to
hide till she can help us get out of this part of the country.""I judge you-uns is givin' it ter me straight," he said, slowly; "but I
don't jes' understan'."What had moonshiners agin' you-uns?"Well, we are not spies; but we were unfortunate enough to incur the
enmity of Wade Miller, and he has sworn to end our lives."cried Rufe, showing his teeth in an ugly manner."An' I
s'pose he's hangin' 'roun' Kate, same as he uster?""He is giving her more or less trouble.""Wal, he won't give her much trouble arter I git at him.I'm goin' ter tell you-uns somethin'.Miller allus pretended
ter be my friend, but it war that critter as put ther revernues onter me
an' got me arrested!He done it because I tol' him Kate war too good fer
him.I know it, an' one thing why I wanted ter git free war ter come har
an' fix ther critter so he won't ever bother Kate no more.I hev swore
ter fix him, an' I'll do it ef I live ter meet him face ter face!"He had grown wildly excited, and he sat up, with his back against a
post, his eyes gleaming redly, and a white foam flecking his lips.At
that moment he reminded the boys of a mad dog.When Kenyon was calmer, Frank told the story of the adventures which had
befallen the boys since entering Lost Creek Valley.The fugitive
listened quietly, watching them closely with his sunken eyes, and,
having heard all, said:

"I judge you-uns tells ther truth.Ef I kin keep hid till Kate gits
har--till I see her--I'll fix things so you won't be bothered much.Wade
Miller's day in Lost Creek Valley is over."The boys took him up to the living room of the old mill, where they
furnished him with the coarse food that remained from their breakfast.He ate like a famished thing, washing the dry bread down with great
swallows of water.When he had finished and his hunger was satisfied, he
was quite like another man.he cried; "now I am reddy fer anything!"And you'll tell me ef thar's danger?"So the hunted wretch was induced to lie down and sleep.He slept soundly
for some hours, and, when he opened his eyes, his sister had her arms
about his neck.He sat up and clasped her in his arms, a look of joy on his face.It is quite unnecessary to describe the joys of that meeting.The boys
had left brother and sister alone together, and the two remained thus
for nearly an hour, at the end of which time Rufe knew all that had
happened since he was taken from Lost Creek Valley, and Kate had also
been made aware of the perfidy of Wade Miller."I judge it is true that bread throwed on ther waters allus comes back,"
said Kate, when the four were together."Now looker how I helped
you-uns, an' then see how it turned out ter be a right good thing fer
Rufe.He found ye har, an' you-uns hev fed him an' watched while he
slept.""An' I hev tol' Kate all about Wade Miller," said the fugitive."That settles him," declared the girl, with a snap."Kate says ther officers think I hev gone on over inter ther next cove,
an' they're arter me, all 'ceptin' two what have been left behind.They'll be back, though, by night.""But you are all right now, for your friends will be on hand by that
time.""Yes; Kate will take word ter Muriel, an' he'll hev ther boys ready ter
fight fer me.Ther officers will find it kinder hot in these parts.""I'd better be goin' now," said the girl."Ther boys oughter know all
about it soon as possible.""That's right," agreed Rufe."This ain't ther best place fer me ter
hide.""No," declared Kate, suddenly; "an' yer mustn't hide har longer, fer
ther officers may come afore night.It
won't do fer ther boys ter go thar, but you kin all right.Ther boys is
best off har, fer ther officers wouldn't hurt 'em."This seemed all right, and it was decided on.Just as they were on the point of descending, Barney gave a cry, caught
Frank by the arm, and drew him toward a window."Phwat do yez think av it
now?"A horseman was coming down the old road that led to the mill.He
bestrode a coal-black horse, and a mask covered his face, while his
long, black hair flowed down on the collar of the coat he wore.He sat
the horse jauntily, riding with a reckless air that seemed to tell of a
daring spirit."An' it's your trate, me lad.""I will treat," said Frank, crestfallen."I am not nearly so smart as I
thought I was."cried Kate, dashing to the window.She did not hesitate to appear in the window and signal to the dashing
young moonshiner, who returned her salute, and motioned for her to come
out."He wants ter see me in er hurry," said the girl."I sent word ter him
by Dummy that ther boys war har, an' that's how he happened ter turn up.Come, Rufe, go out with me.Muriel will be glad to see yer.""And I shall be glad ter see him," declared the escaped convict.Kate bade the boys remain there, telling them she would call them if
they were wanted, and then, with Rufe following, she hurried down the
stairs, and hastened to meet the boy moonshiner, who had halted on the
bank at some distance from the old mill.Watching from the window, Frank and Barney saw her hasten up to Muriel,
saw her speak swiftly, although they could not hear her words, saw
Muriel nod and seem to reply quite as swiftly, and then saw the young
leader of the Black Caps shake her hand in a manner that denoted
pleasure and affection."Ye're a daisy, Frankie, me b'y," snickered Barney Mulloy; "but fer
wance ye wur badly mishtaken.""I was all of that," confessed Frank, as if slightly ashamed."I thought
myself far shrewder than I am."As they watched, they saw Rufe Kenyon suddenly leap up behind Muriel,
and then the doubly burdened horse swung around and went away at a hot
pace, while Kate came flitting back into the mill."The officers are returnin'," she explained."Muriel will take Rufe whar
thar ain't no chance o' their findin' him.You-uns will have ter stay
har.I have brung ye more fodder, an' I judge you'll git along all
right."So she left them hurriedly, being greatly excited over the return of her
brother and his danger.The day passed, and the officers failed to appear in the vicinity of the
mill, although the boys were expecting to see them.When night came Frank and Barney grew impatient, for they were far from
pleased with their lot, but they could do nothing but wait.Two hours after nightfall a form suddenly appeared in the old mill,
rising before the boys like a phantom, although they could not
understand how the fellow came there.In a flash Frank snatched out a revolver and pointed it at the intruder,
crying, sternly:

"Stand still and give an account of yourself!Who are you, and what do
you want?"The figure moved into the range of the window, so that the boys could
see him making strange gestures, pointing to his ears, and pressing his
fingers to his lips."If you don't keep still, I shall shoot.Still the intruder continued to make those strange gestures, pointing to
his ears, and touching his lips.That he saw Frank's revolver glittering
and feared the boy would shoot was evident, but he still remained
silent."Whoy don't th' spalpane spake?""Is it no tongue he has,
Oi dunno?""Perhaps he cannot speak, in which case he is the one Kate calls Dummy.It happened that the sign language of mutes was one of Frank's
accomplishments, he having taken it up during his leisure moments.He
passed the revolver to Barney, saying:

"Keep the fellow covered, while I see if I can talk with him."Frank moved up to the window, held his hands close to the intruder's
face, and spelled:

"You from Kate?"He put up his hands and spelled back:

"Kate send me.Frank interpreted for Barney's benefit, and the Irish lad cried:

"Thin let's be movin'!It's mesilf that's ready ter git out av thase
parruts in a hurry, Oi think."For a moment Frank hesitated about trusting the mute, and then he
decided that it was the best thing to do, and he signaled that they were
ready.Dummy led the way from the mill, crossing by the plank, and plunging
into the pine woods."He sames to be takin' us back th' woay we came, Frankie," said the
Irish lad, in a low tone."He said the horses were waiting for
us.The mute flitted along with surprising silence and speed, and they found
it no easy task to follow and keep close enough to see him.Now and then
he looked back to make sure they were close behind.At last they came to the termination of the pines, and there, in the
deep shadows, they found three horses waiting.Frank felt disappointed, for he wished to see the girl before leaving
the mountains forever.He did not like to go away without touching her
hand again, and expressing his sense of gratitude for the last time.It was his hope that she might join them before they left the mountains.The horses were saddled and bridled, and the boys were about to mount
when a strange, low cry broke from Dummy's lips.There was a sudden stir, and an uprising of dark forms on all sides.Frank tried to snatch out his revolver, but it was too late.He was
seized, disarmed, and crushed to the earth."Did you-uns think ye war goin'
ter escape?Wal, yer didn't know Wade Miller very well.I knowed Kate'd
try ter git yer off, an' all I hed ter do war watch her.I didn't waste
my time runnin' round elsewhar."They were once more in Miller's clutches!He blamed himself for falling
into the trap, and still he could not see how he was to blame.Surely he
had been cautious, but fate was against him.He had escaped Miller
twice; but this was the third time, and he feared that it would prove
disastrous.The hands of the captured boys were tied behind their backs, and then
they were forced to march swiftly along in the midst of the Black Caps
that surrounded them.They were not taken to the cave, but straight to one of the hidden
stills, a little hut that was built against what seemed to be a wall of
solid rock, a great bluff rising against the face of the mountain.Thick
trees concealed the little hut down in the hollow.Some crude candles were lighted, and they saw around them the outfit for
making moonshine whiskey.cried Miller, triumphantly; "you-uns will never go out o' this
place.Ther revernues spotted this still ter-day, but it won't be har
ter-morrer."He made a signal, and the boys were thrown to the floor, where they were
held helpless, while their feet were bound.When this job was finished Miller added:

"No, ther revernues won't find this still ter-morrer, fer it will go up
in smoke.Moonshine is good stuff ter burn, an' we'll see how you-uns
like it."At a word a keg of whiskey was brought to the spot by two men."Let 'em try ther stuff," directed Miller.he's goin' ter fill us up bafore he finishes us!"But that was not the intention of the revengeful man.A plug was knocked from a hole in the end of the keg, and then the
whiskey was poured over the clothing of the boys, wetting them to the
skin.The men did not stop pouring till the clothing of the boys was
thoroughly saturated.said Miller, with a fiendish chuckle, "I reckon you-uns is ready
fer touchin' off, an' ye'll burn like pine knots.Ther way ye'll holler
will make ye heard clean ter ther top o' Black Maounting, an' ther fire
will be seen; but when anybody gits har, you-uns an' this still will be
ashes."He knelt beside Frank, lighted a match, and applied it to the boy's
whiskey-soaked clothing!The flame almost touched Frank's clothing when the boy rolled
over swiftly, thus getting out of the way for the moment.At the same instant the blast of a bugle was heard at the very front of
the hut, and the door fell with a crash, while men poured in by the
opening.rang out a clear voice; "but Muriel!"The boy chief of the Black Caps was there."An' Muriel is not erlone!""Rufe Kenyon is
har!"Out in front of Muriel leaped the escaped criminal, confronting the man
who had betrayed him.Miller staggered, his face turning pale as if struck a heavy blow, and a
bitter exclamation of fury came through his clinched teeth.roared Kate Kenyon's brother, as a long-bladed knife
glittered in his hand, and he thrust back the sleeve of his shirt till
his arm was bared above the elbow."I swore ter finish yer, Miller; but
I'll give ye a squar' show!Draw yer knife, an' may ther best man win!"With the snarl that might have come from the throat of a savage beast,
Miller snatched out a revolver instead of drawing a knife.he screamed; "but I'll shoot ye plumb through ther
heart!"He fired, and Rufe Kenyon ducked at the same time.There was a scream of pain, and Muriel flung up both hands, dropping
into the arms of the man behind.Rufe Kenyon had dodged the bullet, but the boy chief of the Black Caps
had suffered in his stead.Miller seemed dazed by the result of his shot.The revolver fell from
his hand, and he staggered forward, groaning:

"Kate!--I've killed her!"Rufe Kenyon forgot his foe, dropping on one knee beside the prostrate
figure of Muriel, and swiftly removing the mask.panted her brother, "be ye dead?Her eyes opened, and she faintly said:

"Not dead yit, Rufe."Then the brother shouted:

"Ketch Wade Miller!It seemed that every man in the hut leaped to obey.Miller struggled like a tiger, but he was overpowered and dragged out of
the hut, while Rufe still knelt and examined his sister's wound, which
was in her shoulder.Frank and Barney were freed, and they hastened to render such assistance
as they could in dressing the wound and stanching the flow of blood."You-uns don't think that'll be fatal, do yer?"asked Rufe, with
breathless anxiety."There is no reason why it should," assured Frank."She must be taken
home as soon as possible, and a doctor called.I think she will come
through all right, for all of Miller's bullet."The men were trooping back into the hut.roared Rufe, leaping to his feet."He is out har under a tree," answered one of the men, quietly."Who's watchin' him ter see that he don't git erway?"Why, ther p'izen dog will run fer it!""I don't think he'll run fur."Wal, ter make sure he wouldn't run, we hitched a rope around his neck
an' tied it up ter ther limb o' ther tree.Unless ther rope stretches,
he won't be able ter git his feet down onter ther ground by erbout
eighteen inches."muttered Rufe, with a sad shake of his head."I wanted ter
squar 'counts with ther skunk."Kate Kenyon was taken home, and the bullet was extracted from her
shoulder.The wound, although painful, did not prove at all serious, and
she began to recover in a short time.Frank and Barney lingered until it seemed certain that she would
recover, and then they prepared to take their departure.After all, Frank's suspicion had proved true, and it had been revealed
that Muriel was Kate in disguise.Frank chaffed Barney a great deal about it, and the Irish lad took the
chaffing in a good-natured manner.Rufe Kenyon was hidden by his friends, so that his pursuers were forced
to give over the search for him and depart.One still was raided, but not one of the moonshiners was captured, as
they had received ample warning of their danger.On the evening before Frank and Barney were to depart in the morning,
the boys carried Kate out to the door in an easy-chair, and they sat
down near her.Kenyon sat on the steps and smoked her black pipe, looking as
stolid and indifferent as ever."Kate," said Frank, "when did you have your hair cut short?Where is
that profusion of beautiful hair you wore when we first saw you?""Why, my har war cut more'n a year ago.I had it
made inter a'switch,' and I wore it so nobody'd know I had it cut.""You did that in order that you might wear the black wig when you
personated Muriel?""You could do that easily over your short hair.""Well, you played the part well, and you made a dashing boy.But how
about the Muriel who appeared while you were in the mill with us?""You-uns war so sharp that I judged I'd make yer think ye didn't know
so much ez you thought, an' I fixed it up ter have another person show
up in my place."He is no bigger than I, an' he is a good mimic."It's mesilf thot wur chated, an'
thot's not aisy.""You are a shrewd little girl," declared Frank; "and you are dead lucky
to escape with your life after getting Miller's bullet.But Miller won't
trouble you more."Kenyon rose and went into the hut, while Barney lazily strolled
down to the creek, leaving Frank and Kate alone.Half an hour later, as he was coming back, the Irish lad heard Kate
saying:

"I know I'm igerent, an' I'm not fitten fer any educated man.Still, you
an' I is friends, Frank, an' friends we'll allus be.""Friends we will always be," said Frank, softly.It was not long before our friends left the locality, this time bound
for Oklahoma, Utah and California.What Frank's adventures were in those
places will be told in another volume, entitled, "Frank Merriwell's
Bravery.""We are well out of that," said Frank, as they journeyed away."To tell the whole thruth,
me b'y, ye're nivver wrong, nivver!"The battlements
of a fortress have the spaces between equal to the breadth of the
battlement, and yet the space will appear wider; at a great distance
the battlements will appear very much diminished, and being removed
still farther, will disappear entirely, and the fort shew only the
straight wall, as if there were no battlements.CCCXIV./--_Which Parts of Objects disappear first by being
removed farther from the Eye, and which preserve their Appearance._


/The/ smallest parts are those which, by being removed, lose their
appearance first; this may be observed in the gloss upon spherical
bodies, or columns, and the slender parts of animals; as in a stag,
the first sight of which does not discover its legs and horns so soon
as its body, which, being broader, will be perceived from a greater
distance.But the parts which disappear the very first, are the lines
which describe the members, and terminate the surface and shape of
bodies.CCCXV./--_Why Objects are less distinguished in proportion as
they are farther removed from the Eye._


/This/ happens because the smallest parts are lost first; the second,
in point of size, are also lost at a somewhat greater distance, and so
on successively; the parts by degrees melting away, the perception of
the object is diminished; and at last all the parts, and the whole, are
entirely lost to the sight[78].Colours also disappear on account of
the density of the air interposed between the eye and the object.CCCXVI./--_Why Faces appear dark at a Distance._


/It/ is evident that the similitude of all objects placed before us,
large as well as small, is perceptible to our senses through the iris
of the eye.If through so small an entrance the immensity of the sky
and of the earth is admitted, the faces of men (which are scarcely any
thing in comparison of such large objects), being still diminished by
the distance, will occupy so little of the eye, that they become almost
imperceptible.Besides, having to pass through a dark medium from the
surface to the _Retina_ in the inside, where the impression is made,
the colour of faces (not being very strong, and rendered still more
obscure by the darkness of the tube) when arrived at the focus appears
dark.No other reason can be given on that point, except that the speck
in the middle of the apple of the eye is black, and, being full of a
transparent fluid like air, performs the same office as a hole in a
board, which on looking into it appears black; and that those things
which are seen through both a light and dark air, become confused and
obscure.CCCXVII./--_Of Towns and other Buildings seen through a Fog in
the Morning or Evening._


/Buildings/ seen afar off in the morning or in the evening, when there
is a fog, or thick air, shew only those parts distinctly which are
enlightened by the sun towards the horizon; and the parts of those
buildings which are not turned towards the sun remain confused and
almost of the colour of the fog.CCCXVIII./--_Of the Height of Buildings seen in a Fog._


/Of/ a building near the eye the top parts will appear more confused
than the bottom, because there is more fog between the eye and the top
than at the base.And a square tower, seen at a great distance through
a fog, will appear narrower at the base than at the summit.This is
accounted for in Chapter cccxiii.which says, that the fog will appear
whiter and thicker as it approaches the ground; and as it is said
before[79], that a dark object will appear smaller in proportion as it
is placed on a whiter ground.Therefore the fog being whiter at bottom
than at top, it follows that the tower (being darkish) will appear
narrower at the base than at the summit.CCCXIX./--_Why Objects which are high, appear darker at a
Distance than those which are low, though the Fog be uniform, and of
equal Thickness._


/Amongst/ objects situated in a fog, thick air, vapour, smoke, or at
a distance, the highest will be the most distinctly seen: and amongst
objects equal in height, that placed in the darkest fog, will be most
confused and dark.As it happens to the eye H, looking at A B C, three
towers of equal height; it sees the top C as low as R, in two degrees
of thickness; and the top B, in one degree only; therefore the top C
will appear darker than the top of the tower B.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCXX./--_Of Objects seen in a Fog._


/Objects/ seen through a fog will appear larger than they are in
reality, because the aerial perspective does not agree with the linear,
viz.the colour does not agree with the magnitude of the object[80];
such a fog being similar to the thickness of air interposed between the
eye and the horizon in fine weather.But in this case the fog is near
the eye, and though the object be also near, it makes it appear as if
it were as far off as the horizon; where a great tower would appear no
bigger than a man placed near the eye.CCCXXI./--_Of those Objects which the Eyes perceive through a
Mist or thick Air._


/The/ nearer the air is to water, or to the ground, the thicker it
becomes.It is proved by the nineteenth proposition of the second
book[81], that bodies rise in proportion to their weight; and it
follows, that a light body will rise higher than another which is heavy.CCCXXII./--_Miscellaneous Observations._


/Of/ different objects equal in magnitude, form, shade, and distance
from the eye, those will appear the smaller that are placed on the
lighter ground.This is exemplified by observing the sun when seen
behind a tree without leaves; all the ramifications seen against that
great light are so diminished that they remain almost invisible.The
same may be observed of a pole placed between the sun and the eye.Parallel bodies placed upright, and seen through a fog, will
appear larger at top than at bottom.This is proved by the ninth
proposition[82], which says, that a fog, or thick air, penetrated by
the rays of the sun, will appear whiter the lower they are.Things seen afar off will appear out of proportion, because the parts
which are the lightest will send their image with stronger rays than
the parts which are darkest.I have seen a woman dressed in black,
with a white veil over her head, which appeared twice as large as her
shoulders covered with black.MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.CCCXXIII./--_Of Objects seen at a Distance._


/Any/ dark object will appear lighter when removed to some distance
from the eye.It follows, by the contrary reason, that a dark object
will appear still darker when brought nearer to the eye.Therefore the
inferior parts of any object whatever, placed in thick air, will appear
farther from the eye at the bottom than at the top; for that reason the
lower parts of a mountain appear farther off than its top, which is in
reality the farthest.CCCXXIV./--_Of a Town seen through a thick Air._


/The/ eye which, looking downwards, sees a town immersed in very thick
air, will perceive the top of the buildings darker, but more distinct
than the bottom.The tops detach against a light ground, because they
are seen against the low and thick air which is beyond them.This is a
consequence of what has been explained in the preceding chapter.CCCXXV./--_How to draw a Landscape._


/Contrive/ that the trees in your landscape be half in shadow and half
in the light.It is better to represent them as when the sun is veiled
with thin clouds, because in that case the trees receive a general
light from the sky, and are darkest in those parts which are nearest to
the earth.CCCXXVI./--_Of the Green of the Country._


/Of/ the greens seen in the country, that of trees and other plants
will appear darker than that of fields and meadows, though they may
happen to be of the same quality.CCCXXVII./--_What Greens will appear most of a blueish Cast._


/Those/ greens will appear to approach nearest to blue which are
of the darkest shade when remote.This is proved by the seventh
proposition[83], which says, that blue is composed of black and white
seen at a great distance.CCCXXVIII./--_The Colour of the Sea from different Aspects._


/When/ the sea is a little ruffled it has no sameness of colour; for
whoever looks at it from the shore, will see it of a dark colour, in a
greater degree as it approaches towards the horizon, and will perceive
also certain lights moving slowly on the surface like a flock of sheep.Whoever looks at the sea from on board a ship, at a distance from the
land, sees it blue.Near the shore it appears darkish, on account of
the colour of the earth reflected by the water, as in a looking-glass;
but at sea the azure of the air is reflected to the eye by the waves in
the same manner.CCCXXIX./--_Why the same Prospect appears larger at some Times
than at others._


/Objects/ in the country appear sometimes larger and sometimes smaller
than they actually are, from the circumstance of the air interposed
between the eye and the horizon, happening to be either thicker or
thinner than usual.Of two horizons equally distant from the eye, that which is seen
through the thicker air will appear farther removed; and the other will
seem nearer, being seen through a thinner air.Objects of unequal size, but equally distant, will appear equal if the
air which is between them and the eye be of proportionable inequality
of thickness, viz.if the thickest air be interposed between the eye
and the smallest of the objects.This is proved by the perspective of
colours[84], which is so deceitful that a mountain which would appear
small by the compasses, will seem larger than a small hill near the
eye; as a finger placed near the eye will cover a large mountain far
off.CCCXXX./--_Of Smoke._


/Smoke/ is more transparent, though darker towards the extremities of
its waves than in the middle.It moves in a more oblique direction in proportion to the force of the
wind which impels it.Different kinds of smoke vary in colour, as the causes that produce
them are various.Smoke never produces determined shadows, and the extremities are lost
as they recede from their primary cause.Objects behind it are less
apparent in proportion to the thickness of the smoke.It is whiter
nearer its origin, and bluer towards its termination.Fire appears darker, the more smoke there is interposed between it and
the eye.Where smoke is farther distant, the objects are less confused by it.It encumbers and dims all the landscape like a fog.Smoke is seen to
issue from different places, with flames at the origin, and the most
dense part of it.The tops of mountains will be more seen than the
lower parts, as in a fog.CCCXXXI./--_In what Part Smoke is lightest._


/Smoke/ which is seen between the sun and the eye will be lighter and
more transparent than any other in the landscape.The same is observed
of dust, and of fog; while, if you place yourself between the sun and
those objects, they will appear dark.CCCXXXII./--_Of the Sun-beams passing through the Openings of
Clouds._


/The/ sun-beams which penetrate the openings interposed between clouds
of various density and form, illuminate all the places over which they
pass, and tinge with their own colour all the dark places that are
behind: which dark places are only seen in the intervals between the
rays.CCCXXXIII./--_Of the Beginning of Rain._


/When/ the rain begins to fall, it tarnishes and darkens the air,
giving it a dull colour, but receives still on one side a faint light
from the sun, and is shaded on the other side, as we observe in clouds;
till at last it darkens also the earth, depriving it entirely of the
light of the sun.Objects seen through the rain appear confused and of
undetermined shape, but those which are near will be more distinct.It
is observable, that on the side where the rain is shaded, objects will
be more clearly distinguished than where it receives the light; because
on the shady side they lose only their principal lights, whilst on
the other they lose both their lights and shadows, the lights mixing
with the light part of the rain, and the shadows are also considerably
weakened by it.CCCXXXIV./--_The Seasons are to be observed._


/In/ Autumn you will represent the objects according as it is more or
less advanced.At the beginning of it the leaves of the oldest branches
only begin to fade, more or less, however, according as the plant is
situated in a fertile or barren country; and do not imitate those who
represent trees of every kind (though at equal distance) with the same
quality of green.Endeavour to vary the colour of meadows, stones,
trunks of trees, and all other objects, as much as possible, for Nature
abounds in variety _ad infinitum_.CCCXXXV./--_The Difference of Climates to be observed._


/Near/ the sea-shore, and in southern parts, you will be careful not to
represent the Winter season by the appearance of trees and fields, as
you would do in places more inland, and in northern countries, except
when these are covered with ever-greens, which shoot afresh all the
year round.CCCXXXVI./--_Of Dust._


/Dust/ becomes lighter the higher it rises, and appears darker the less
it is raised, when it is seen between the eye and the sun.CCCXXXVII./--_How to represent the Wind._


/In/ representing the effect of the wind, besides the bending of trees,
and leaves twisting the wrong side upwards, you will also express the
small dust whirling upwards till it mixes in a confused manner with the
air.CCCXXXVIII./--_Of a Wilderness._


/Those/ trees and shrubs which are by their nature more loaded with
small branches, ought to be touched smartly in the shadows, but those
which have larger foliage, will cause broader shadows.CCCXXXIX./--_Of the Horizon seen in the Water._


/By/ the sixth proposition[85], the horizon will be seen in the water
as in a looking-glass, on that side which is opposite the eye.And
if the painter has to represent a spot covered with water, let him
remember that the colour of it cannot be either lighter or darker than
that of the neighbouring objects.CCCXL./--_Of the Shadow of Bridges on the Surface of the Water._


/The/ shadows of bridges can never be seen on the surface of the water,
unless it should have lost its transparent and reflecting quality,
and become troubled and muddy; because clear water being polished and
smooth on its surface, the image of the bridge is formed in it as in
a looking-glass, and reflected in all the points situated between the
eye and the bridge at equal angles; and even the air is seen under the
arches.These circumstances cannot happen when the water is muddy,
because it does not reflect the objects any longer, but receives the
shadow of the bridge in the same manner as a dusty road would receive
it.CCCXLI./--_How a Painter ought to put in Practice the
Perspective of Colours._


/To/ put in practice that perspective which teaches the alteration, the
lessening, and even the entire loss of the very essence of colours,
you must take some points in the country at the distance of about
sixty-five yards[86] from each other; as trees, men, or some other
remarkable objects.In regard to the first tree, you will take a glass,
and having fixed that well, and also your eye, draw upon it, with the
greatest accuracy, the tree you see through it; then put it a little
on one side, and compare it closely with the natural one, and colour
it, so that in shape and colour it may resemble the original, and that
by shutting one eye they may both appear painted, and at the same
distance.The same rule may be applied to the second and third tree
at the distance you have fixed.These studies will be very useful if
managed with judgment, where they may be wanted in the offscape of a
picture.I have observed that the second tree is less by four fifths
than the first, at the distance of thirteen yards.CCCXLII./--_Various Precepts in Painting._


/The/ superficies of any opake body participates of the colour of the
transparent medium interposed between the eye and such body, in a
greater or less degree, in proportion to the density of such medium and
the space it occupies.The outlines of opake bodies will be less apparent in proportion as
those bodies are farther distant from the eye.That part of the opake body will be the most shaded, or lightest, which
is nearest to the body that shades it, or gives it light.The surface of any opake body participates more or less of the colour
of that body which gives it light, in proportion as the latter is more
or less remote, or more or less strong.Objects seen between lights and shadows will appear to have greater
relievo than those which are placed wholly in the light, or wholly in
shadow.When you give strength and precision to objects seen at a great
distance, they will appear as if they were very near.Endeavour that
your imitation be such as to give a just idea of distances.If the
object in nature appear confused in the outlines, let the same be
observed in your picture.The outlines of distant objects appear undetermined and confused,
for two reasons: the first is, that they come to the eye by so small
an angle, and are therefore so much diminished, that they strike the
sight no more than small objects do, which though near can hardly be
distinguished, such as the nails of the fingers, insects, and other
similar things: the second is, that between the eye and the distant
objects there is so much air interposed, that it becomes thick; and,
like a veil, tinges the shadows with its own whiteness, and turns them
from a dark colour to another between black and white, such as azure.Although, by reason of the great distance, the appearance of many
things is lost, yet those things which receive the light from the sun
will be more discernible, while the rest remain enveloped in confused
shadows.And because the air is thicker near the ground, the things
which are lower will appear confused; and _vice versa_.When the sun tinges the clouds on the horizon with red, those objects
which, on account of their distance, appear blueish, will participate
of that redness, and will produce a mixture between the azure and red,
which renders the prospect lively and pleasant; all the opake bodies
which receive that light will appear distinct, and of a reddish colour,
and the air, being transparent, will be impregnated with it, and appear
of the colour of lilies[87].The air which is between the earth and the sun when it rises or sets,
will always dim the objects it surrounds, more than the air any where
else, because it is whiter.It is not necessary to mark strongly the outlines of any object which
is placed upon another.If the outline or extremity of a white and curved surface terminate
upon another white body, it will have a shade at that extremity, darker
than any part of the light; but if against a dark object, such outline,
or extremity, will be lighter than any part of the light.Those objects which are most different in colour, will appear the most
detached from each other.Those parts of objects which first disappear in the distance, are
extremities similar in colour, and ending one upon the other, as the
extremities of an oak tree upon another oak similar to it.The next to
disappear at a greater distance are, objects of mixed colours, when
they terminate one upon the other, as trees, ploughed fields, walls,
heaps of rubbish, or of stones.The last extremities of bodies that
vanish are those which, being light, terminate upon a dark ground; or
being dark, upon a light ground.Of objects situated above the eye, at equal heights, the farthest
removed from the eye will appear the lowest; and if situated below
the eye, the nearest to it will appear the lowest.The parallel lines
situated sidewise will concur to one point[88].Those objects which are near a river, or a lake, in the distant part of
a landscape, are less apparent and distinct than those that are remote
from them.Of bodies of equal density, those that are nearest to the eye will
appear thinnest, and the most remote thickest.A large eye-ball will see objects larger than a small one.The
experiment may be made by looking at any of the celestial bodies,
through a pin-hole, which being capable of admitting but a portion
of its light, it seems to diminish and lose of its size in the same
proportion as the pin-hole is smaller than the usual apparent size of
the object.A thick air interposed between the eye and any object, will render the
outlines of such object undetermined and confused, and make it appear
of a larger size than it is in reality; because the linear perspective
does not diminish the angle which conveys the object to the eye.The
aerial perspective carries it farther off, so that the one removes it
from the eye, while the other preserves its magnitude[89].When the sun is in the West the vapours of the earth fall down again
and thicken the air, so that objects not enlightened by the sun remain
dark and confused, but those which receive its light will be tinged
yellow and red, according to the sun's appearance on the horizon.Again, those that receive its light are very distinct, particularly
public buildings and houses in towns and villages, because their
shadows are dark, and it seems as if those parts which are plainly seen
were coming out of confused and undetermined foundations, because at
that time every thing is of one and the same colour, except what is
enlightened by the sun[90].Any object receiving the light from the sun, receives also the general
light; so that two kinds of shadows are produced: the darkest of the
two is that which happens to have its central line directed towards the
centre of the sun.The central lines of the primitive and secondary
lights are the same as the central lines of the primitive and secondary
shadows.The setting sun is a beautiful and magnificent object when it tinges
with its colour all the great buildings of towns, villages, and the top
of high trees in the country.All below is confused and almost lost in
a tender and general mass; for, being only enlightened by the air, the
difference between the shadows and the lights is small, and for that
reason it is not much detached.But those that are high are touched
by the rays of the sun, and, as was said before, are tinged with its
colour; the painter therefore ought to take the same colour with which
he has painted the sun, and employ it in all those parts of his work
which receive its light.It also happens very often, that a cloud will appear dark without
receiving any shadow from a separate cloud, according to the situation
of the eye; because it will see only the shady part of the one, while
it sees both the enlightened and shady parts of the other.Of two objects at equal height, that which is the farthest off will
appear the lowest.Observe the first cloud in the cut, though it
is lower than the second, it appears as if it were higher.This is
demonstrated by the section of the pyramidical rays of the low cloud at
M A, and the second (which is higher) at N M, below M A. This happens
also when, on account of the rays of the setting or rising sun, a dark
cloud appears higher than another which is light.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCXLIII./--_The Brilliancy of a Landscape._


/The/ vivacity and brightness of colours in a landscape will never bear
any comparison with a landscape in nature when illumined by the sun,
unless the picture be placed so as to receive the same light from the
sun itself.MISCELLANEOUS OBSERVATIONS.CCCXLIV./--_Why a painted Object does not appear so far distant
as a real one, though they be conveyed to the Eye by equal Angles._


[Illustration]

/If/ a house be painted on the pannel B C, at the apparent distance of
one mile, and by the side of it a real one be perceived at the true
distance of one mile also; which objects are so disposed, that the
pannel, or picture, A C, intersects the pyramidical rays with the same
opening of angles; yet these two objects will never appear of the same
size, nor at the same distance, if seen with both eyes[91].CCCXLV./--_How to draw a Figure standing upon its Feet, to
appear forty Braccia_[92] _high, in a Space of twenty Braccia, with
proportionate Members._


/In/ this, as in any other case, the painter is not to mind what kind
of surface he has to work upon; particularly if his painting is to be
seen from a determined point, such as a window, or any other opening.Because the eye is not to attend to the evenness or roughness of the
wall, but only to what is to be represented as beyond that wall; such
as a landscape, or any thing else.Nevertheless a curved surface, such
as F R G, would be the best, because it has no angles.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCXLVI./--_How to draw a Figure twenty-four Braccia high, upon
a Wall twelve Braccia high._ Plate XXII./Draw/ upon part of the wall M N, half the figure you mean to
represent; and the other half upon the cove above, M R. But before
that, it will be necessary to draw upon a flat board, or a paper, the
profile of the wall and cove, of the same shape and dimension, as that
upon which you are to paint.Then draw also the profile of your figure,
of whatever size you please, by the side of it; draw all the lines to
the point F, and where they intersect the profile M R, you will have
the dimensions of your figure as they ought to be drawn upon the real
spot.You will find, that on the straight part of the wall M N, it will
come of its proper form, because the going off perpendicularly will
diminish it naturally; but that part which comes upon the curve will be
diminished upon your drawing.The whole must be traced afterwards upon
the real spot, which is similar to M N. This is a good and safe method._London, Published by J. Taylor High Holborn._]




/Chap.CCCXLVII./--_Why, on measuring a Face, and then painting it of
the same Size, it will appear larger than the natural one._


A B is the breadth of the space, or of the head, and it is placed on
the paper at the distance C F, where the cheeks are, and it would have
to stand back all A C, and then the temples would be carried to the
distance O R of the lines A F, B F; so that there is the difference C
O and R D. It follows that the line C F, and the line D F, in order
to become shorter[93], have to go and find the paper where the whole
height is drawn, that is to say, the lines F A, and F B, where the true
size is; and so it makes the difference, as I have said, of C O, and R
D.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCXLVIII./--_Why the most perfect Imitation of Nature will not
appear to have the same Relief as Nature itself._


/If/ nature is seen with two eyes, it will be impossible to imitate it
upon a picture so as to appear with the same relief, though the lines,
the lights, shades, and colour, be perfectly imitated[94].It is proved
thus: let the eyes A B, look at the object C, with the concurrence of
both the central visual rays A C and B C. I say, that the sides of the
visual angles (which contain these central rays) will see the space G
D, behind the object C. The eye A will see all the space FD, and the
eye B all the space G E. Therefore the two eyes will see behind the
object C all the space F E; for which reason that object C becomes as
it were transparent, according to the definition of transparent bodies,
behind which nothing is hidden.This cannot happen if an object were
seen with one eye only, provided it be larger than the eye.From all
that has been said, we may conclude, that a painted object, occupying
all the space it has behind, leaves no possible way to see any part of
the ground, which it covers entirely by its own circumference[95].[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCXLIX./--_Universality of Painting; a Precept._


/A painter/ cannot be said to aim at universality in the art, unless
he love equally every species of that art.For instance, if he delight
only in landscape, his can be esteemed only as a simple investigation;
and, as our friend Botticello[96] remarks, is but a vain study; since,
by throwing a sponge impregnated with various colours against a wall,
it leaves some spots upon it, which may appear like a landscape.It is
true also, that a variety of compositions may be seen in such spots,
according to the disposition of mind with which they are considered;
such as heads of men, various animals, battles, rocky scenes, seas,
clouds, woods, and the like.It may be compared to the sound of bells,
which may seem to say whatever we choose to imagine.In the same manner
also, those spots may furnish hints for compositions, though they do
not teach us how to finish any particular part; and the imitators of
them are but sorry landscape-painters.CCCL./--_In what Manner the Mirror is the true Master of
Painters._


/When/ you wish to know if your picture be like the object you mean to
represent, have a flat looking-glass, and place it so as to reflect the
object you have imitated, and compare carefully the original with the
copy.You see upon a flat mirror the representation of things which
appear real; Painting is the same.They are both an even superficies,
and both give the idea of something beyond their superficies.Since you
are persuaded that the looking-glass, by means of lines and shades,
gives you the representation of things as if they were real; you being
in possession of colours which in their different lights and shades are
stronger than those of the looking-glass, may certainly, if you employ
the rules with judgment, give to your picture the same appearance of
Nature as you admire in the looking-glass.Or rather, your picture will
be like Nature itself seen in a large looking-glass.This looking-glass (being your master) will shew you the lights and
shades of any object whatever.Amongst your colours there are some
lighter than the lightest part of your model, and also some darker
than the strongest shades; from which it follows, that you ought to
represent Nature as seen in your looking-glass, when you look at it
with one eye only; because both eyes surround the objects too much,
particularly when they are small[97].CCCLI./--_Which Painting is to be esteemed the best._


/That/ painting is the most commendable which has the greatest
conformity to what is meant to be imitated.This kind of comparison
will often put to shame a certain description of painters, who pretend
they can mend the works of Nature; as they do, for instance, when
they pretend to represent a child twelve months old, giving him eight
heads in height, when Nature in its best proportion admits but five.The breadth of the shoulders also, which is equal to the head, they
make double, giving to a child a year old, the proportions of a man of
thirty.They have so often practised, and seen others practise these
errors, that they have converted them into habit, which has taken so
deep a root in their corrupted judgment, that they persuade themselves
that Nature and her imitators are wrong in not following their own
practice[98].CCCLII./--_Of the Judgment to be made of a Painter's Work._


/The/ first thing to be considered is, whether the figures have their
proper relief, according to their respective situations, and the light
they are in: that the shadows be not the same at the extremities of
the groups, as in the middle; because being surrounded by shadows, or
shaded only on one side, produce very different effects.The groups in
the middle are surrounded by shadows from the other figures, which are
between them and the light.Those which are at the extremities have
the shadows only on one side, and receive the light on the other.The
strongest and smartest touches of shadows are to be in the interstice
between the figures of the principal group where the light cannot
penetrate[99].Secondly, that by the order and disposition of the figures they appear
to be accommodated to the subject, and the true representation of the
history in question.Thirdly, that the figures appear alive to the occasion which brought
them together, with expressions suited to their attitudes.CCCLIII./--_How to make an imaginary Animal appear natural._


/It/ is evident that it will be impossible to invent any animal without
giving it members, and these members must individually resemble those
of some known animal.If you wish, therefore, to make a chimera, or imaginary animal, appear
natural (let us suppose a serpent); take the head of a mastiff, the
eyes of a cat, the ears of a porcupine, the mouth of a hare, the
brows of a lion, the temples of an old cock, and the neck of a sea
tortoise[100].CCCLIV./--_Painters are not to imitate one another._


/One/ painter ought never to imitate the manner of any other; because
in that case he cannot be called the child of Nature, but the
grandchild.It is always best to have recourse to Nature, which is
replete with such abundance of objects, than to the productions of
other masters, who learnt every thing from her.CCCLV./--_How to judge of one's own Work._


/It/ is an acknowledged fact, that we perceive errors in the works of
others more readily than in our own.A painter, therefore, ought to
be well instructed in perspective, and acquire a perfect knowledge of
the dimensions of the human body; he should also be a good architect,
at least as far as concerns the outward shape of buildings, with their
different parts; and where he is deficient, he ought not to neglect
taking drawings from Nature.It will be well also to have a looking-glass by him, when he paints,
to look often at his work in it, which being seen the contrary way,
will appear as the work of another hand, and will better shew his
faults.It will be useful also to quit his work often, and take some
relaxation, that his judgment may be clearer at his return; for too
great application and sitting still is sometimes the cause of many
gross errors.CCCLVI./--_Of correcting Errors which you discover._


/Remember/, that when, by the exercise of your own judgment, or the
observation of others, you discover any errors in your work, you
immediately set about correcting them, lest, in exposing your works to
the public, you expose your defects also.Admit not any self-excuse,
by persuading yourself that you shall retrieve your character, and
that by some succeeding work you shall make amends for your shameful
negligence; for your work does not perish as soon as it is out of your
hands, like the sound of music, but remains a standing monument of your
ignorance.If you excuse yourself by saying that you have not time for
the study necessary to form a great painter, having to struggle against
necessity, you yourself are only to blame; for the study of what is
excellent is food both for mind and body.How many philosophers, born
to great riches, have given them away, that they might not be retarded
in their pursuits!CCCLVII./--_The best Place for looking at a Picture._


/Let/ us suppose, that A B is the picture, receiving the light from D;
I say, that whoever is placed between C and E, will see the picture
very badly, particularly if it be painted in oil, or varnished; because
it will shine, and will appear almost of the nature of a looking-glass.For these reasons, the nearer you go towards C, the less you will be
able to see, because of the light from the window upon the picture,
sending its reflection to that point.But if you place yourself between
E D, you may conveniently see the picture, and the more so as you draw
nearer to the point D, because that place is less liable to be struck
by the reflected rays.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCLVIII./--_Of Judgment._


/There/ is nothing more apt to deceive us than our own judgment, in
deciding on our own works; and we should derive more advantage from
having our faults pointed out by our enemies, than by hearing the
opinions of our friends, because they are too much like ourselves, and
may deceive us as much as our own judgment.CCCLIX./--_Of Employment anxiously wished for by Painters._


/And/ you, painter, who are desirous of great practice, understand,
that if you do not rest it on the good foundation of Nature, you will
labour with little honour and less profit; and if you do it on a good
ground your works will be many and good, to your great honour and
advantage.CCCLX./--_Advice to Painters._


/A painter/ ought to study universal Nature, and reason much within
himself on all he sees, making use of the most excellent parts that
compose the species of every object before him.His mind will by this
method be like a mirror, reflecting truly every object placed before
it, and become, as it were, a second Nature.CCCLXI./--_Of Statuary._


/To/ execute a figure in marble, you must first make a model of it in
clay, or plaster, and when it is finished, place it in a square case,
equally capable of receiving the block of marble intended to be shaped
like it.Have some peg-like sticks to pass through holes made in the
sides, and all round the case; push them in till every one touches the
model, marking what remains of the sticks outwards with ink, and making
a countermark to every stick and its hole, so that you may at pleasure
replace them again.Then having taken out the model, and placed the
block of marble in its stead, take so much out of it, till all the pegs
go in at the same holes to the marks you had made.To facilitate the
work, contrive your frame so that every part of it, separately, or all
together, may be lifted up, except the bottom, which must remain under
the marble.By this method you may chop it off with great facility[101].CCCLXII./--_On the Measurement and Division of Statues into
Parts._


/Divide/ the head into twelve parts, each part into twelve degrees,
each degree into twelve minutes, and these minutes into seconds[102].CCCLXIII./--_A Precept for the Painter._


/The/ painter who entertains no doubt of his own ability, will attain
very little.When the work succeeds beyond the judgment, the artist
acquires nothing; but when the judgment is superior to the work, he
never ceases improving, if the love of gain do not <DW44> his progress.CCCLXIV./--_On the Judgment of Painters._


/When/ the work is equal to the knowledge and judgment of the painter,
it is a bad sign; and when it surpasses the judgment, it is still
worse, as is the case with those who wonder at having succeeded so
well.But when the judgment surpasses the work, it is a perfectly good
sign; and the young painter who possesses that rare disposition, will,
no doubt, arrive at great perfection.He will produce few works, but
they will be such as to fix the admiration of every beholder.CCCLXV./--_That a Man ought not to trust to himself, but ought
to consult Nature._


/Whoever/ flatters himself that he can retain in his memory all the
effects of Nature, is deceived, for our memory is not so capacious;
therefore consult Nature for every thing.BOOKS

acquired, the student will inevitably fall into errors, as gross as
those humorously pointed out by Hogarth, in his Frontispiece to Kirby's
Perspective.][Footnote 3: Not to be found in this work.][Footnote 4: From this, and many other similar passages, it is evident,
that the author intended at some future time to arrange his manuscript
collections, and to publish them as separate treatises.That he did not
do so is well known; but it is also a fact, that, in selecting from the
whole mass of his collections the chapters of which the present work
consists, great care appears in general to have been taken to extract
also those to which there was any reference from any of the chapters
intended for this work, or which from their subject were necessarily
connected with them.Accordingly, the reader will find, in the notes
to this translation, that all such chapters in any other part of the
present work are uniformly pointed out, as have any relation to the
respective passages in the text.This, which has never before been
done, though indispensably necessary, will be found of singular use,
and it was thought proper here, once for all, to notice it.In the present instance the chapters, referring to the subject in the
text, are Chap.; and though these
do not afford complete information, yet it is to be remembered, that
drawing from relievos is subject to the very same rules as drawing from
Nature; and that, therefore, what is elsewhere said on that subject is
also equally applicable to this.][Footnote 5: The meaning of this is, that the last touches of light,
such as the shining parts (which are always narrow), must be given
sparingly.In short, that the drawing must be kept in broad masses as
much as possible.][Footnote 6: This is not an absolute rule, but it is a very good one
for drawing of portraits.][Footnote 9: See the two preceding chapters.][Footnote 10: Man being the highest of the animal creation, ought to be
the chief object of study.][Footnote 11: An intended Treatise, as it seems, on Anatomy, which
however never was published; but there are several chapters in the
present work on the subject of Anatomy, most of which will be found
under the present head of Anatomy; and of such as could not be placed
there, because they also related to some other branch, the following
is a list by which they may be found: Chapters vi.[Footnote 13: It does not appear that this intention was ever carried
into execution; but there are many chapters in this work on the subject
of motion, where all that is necessary for a painter in this branch
will be found.][Footnote 14: Anatomists have divided this muscle into four or five
sections; but painters, following the ancient sculptors, shew only
the three principal ones; and, in fact, we find that a greater number
of them (as may often be observed in nature) gives a disagreeable
meagreness to the subject.Beautiful nature does not shew more than
three, though there may be more hid under the skin.][Footnote 15: A treatise on weights, like many others, intended by this
author, but never published.][Footnote 17: It is believed that this treatise, like many others
promised by the author, was never written; and to save the necessity of
frequently repeating this fact, the reader is here informed, once for
all, that in the life of the author prefixed to this edition, will be
found an account of the works promised or projected by him, and how far
his intentions have been carried into effect.][Footnote 19: See in this work from chap.[Footnote 22: The author here means to compare the different quickness
of the motion of the head and the heel, when employed in the same
action of jumping; and he states the proportion of the former to be
three times that of the latter.The reason he gives for this is in
substance, that as the head has but one motion to make, while in fact
the lower part of the figure has three successive operations to perform
at the places he mentions, three times the velocity, or, in other
words, three times the degree of effort, is necessary in the head, the
prime mover, to give the power of influencing the other parts; and
the rule deducible from this axiom is, that where two different parts
of the body concur in the same action, and one of them has to perform
one motion only, while the other is to have several, the proportion of
velocity or effort in the former must be regulated by the number of
operations necessary in the latter.][Footnote 23: It is explained in this work, or at least there is
something respecting it in the preceding chapter, and in chap.[Footnote 24: The eyeball moving up and down to look at the hand,
describes a part of a circle, from every point of which it sees it
in an infinite variety of aspects.The hand also is moveable _ad
infinitum_ (for it can go round the whole circle--see chap.),
and consequently shew itself in an infinite variety of aspects, which
it is impossible for any memory to retain.][Footnote 26: About thirteen yards of our measure, the Florentine
braccia, or cubit, by which the author measures, being 1 foot 10 inches
7-8ths English measure.][Footnote 28: It is supposed that the figures are to appear of the
natural size, and not bigger.In that case, the measure of the first,
to be of the exact dimension, should have its feet resting upon the
bottom line; but as you remove it from that, it should diminish.No allusion is here intended to the distance at which a picture is to
be placed from the eye.][Footnote 29: The author does not mean here to say, that one historical
picture cannot be hung over another.It certainly may, because, in
viewing each, the spectator is at liberty (especially if they are
subjects independent of each other) to shift his place so as to stand
at the true point of sight for viewing every one of them; but in
covering a wall with a succession of subjects from the same history,
the author considers the whole as, in fact, but one picture, divided
into compartments, and to be seen at one view, and which cannot
therefore admit more than one point of sight.In the former case, the
pictures are in fact so many distinct subjects unconnected with each
other.]This chapter is obscure, and may probably be made clear by merely
stating it in other words.Leonardo objects to the use of both eyes,
because, in viewing in that manner the objects here mentioned, two
balls, one behind the other, the second is seen, which would not be
the case, if the angle of the visual rays were not too big for the
first object.Whoever is at all acquainted with optics, need not be
told, that the visual rays commence in a single point in the centre, or
nearly the centre of each eye, and continue diverging.But, in using
both eyes, the visual rays proceed not from one and the same centre,
but from a different centre in each eye, and intersecting each other,
as they do a little before passing the first object, they become
together broader than the extent of the first object, and consequently
give a view of part of the second.On the contrary, in using but one
eye, the visual rays proceed but from one centre; and as, therefore,
there cannot be any intersection, the visual rays, when they reach the
first object, are not broader than the first object, and the second is
completely hidden.Properly speaking, therefore, in using both eyes we
introduce more than one point of sight, which renders the perspective
false in the painting; but in using one eye only, there can be, as
there ought, but one point of sight.There is, however, this difference
between viewing real objects and those represented in painting, that in
looking at the former, whether we use one or both eyes, the objects,
by being actually detached from the back ground, admit the visual rays
to strike on them, so as to form a correct perspective, from whatever
point they are viewed, and the eye accordingly forms a perspective of
its own; but in viewing the latter, there is no possibility of varying
the perspective; and, unless the picture is seen precisely under the
same angle as it was painted under, the perspective in all other views
must be false.This is observable in the perspective views painted for
scenes at the playhouse.If the beholder is seated in the central line
of the house, whether in the boxes or pit, the perspective is correct;
but, in proportion as he is placed at a greater or less distance to the
right or left of that line, the perspective appears to him more or less
faulty.And hence arises the necessity of using but one eye in viewing
a painting, in order thereby to reduce it to one point of sight.][Footnote 32: See the Life of the Author prefixed, and chap.[Footnote 33: The author here speaks of unpolished Nature; and indeed
it is from such subjects only, that the genuine and characteristic
operations of Nature are to be learnt.It is the effect of education
to correct the natural peculiarities and defects, and, by so doing, to
assimilate one person to the rest of the world.][Footnote 36: See chapter cclxvii.][Footnote 37: Sir Joshua Reynolds frequently inculcated these precepts
in his lectures, and indeed they cannot be too often enforced.][Footnote 38: Probably this would have formed a part of his intended
Treatise on Light and Shadow, but no such proposition occurs in the
present work.][Footnote 41: This cannot be taken as an absolute rule; it must be left
in a great measure to the judgment of the painter.For much graceful
softness and grandeur is acquired, sometimes, by blending the lights of
the figures with the light part of the ground; and so of the shadows;
as Leonardo himself has observed in chapters cxciv.and Sir
Joshua Reynolds has often put in practice with success.][Footnote 44: He means here to say, that in proportion as the body
interposed between the eye and the object is more or less transparent,
the greater or less quantity of the colour of the body interposed will
be communicated to the object.][Footnote 45: See the note to chap.[Footnote 46: See the preceding chapter, and chap.[Footnote 47: The appearance of motion is lessened according to the
distance, in the same proportion as objects diminish in size.][Footnote 50: This was intended to constitute a part of some book of
Perspective, which we have not; but the rule here referred to will be
found in chap.[Footnote 52: No such work was ever published, nor, for any thing that
appears, ever written.][Footnote 53: The French translation of 1716 has a note on this
chapter, saying, that the invention of enamel painting found out since
the time of Leonardo da Vinci, would better answer to the title of this
chapter, and also be a better method of painting.I must beg leave,
however, to dissent from this opinion, as the two kinds of painting
are so different, that they cannot be compared.Leonardo treats of oil
painting, but the other is vitrification.Leonardo is known to have
spent a great deal of time in experiments, of which this is a specimen,
and it may appear ridiculous to the practitioners of more modern
date, as he does not enter more fully into a minute description of
the materials, or the mode of employing them.The principle laid down
in the text appears to me to be simply this: to make the oil entirely
evaporate from the colours by the action of fire, and afterwards to
prevent the action of the air by the means of a glass, which in itself
is an excellent principle, but not applicable, any more than enamel
painting to large works.][Footnote 54: It is evident that distemper or size painting is here
meant.][Footnote 56: This rule is not without exception: see chap.[Footnote 59: See chapters ccxlvii.Probably they were intended to form a part of a distinct treatise, and
to have been ranged as propositions in that, but at present they are
not so placed.][Footnote 62: Although the author seems to have designed that this, and
many other propositions to which he refers, should have formed a part
of some regular work, and he has accordingly referred to them whenever
he has mentioned them, by their intended numerical situation in that
work, whatever it might be, it does not appear that he ever carried
this design into execution.There are, however, several chapters in
the present work, viz.in which the
principle in the text is recognised, and which probably would have been
transferred into the projected treatise, if he had ever drawn it up.][Footnote 63: The note on the preceding chapter is in a great measure
applicable to this, and the proposition mentioned in the text is also
to be found in chapter ccxlvii.[Footnote 64: See the note on the chapter next but one preceding.The
proposition in the text occurs in chap.[Footnote 66: I do not know a better comment on this passage than
Felibien's Examination of Le Brun's Picture of the Tent of Darius.From this (which has been reprinted with an English translation, by
Colonel Parsons in 1700, in folio) it will clearly appear, what the
chain of connexion is between every colour there used, and its nearest
neighbour, and consequently a rule may be formed from it with more
certainty and precision than where the student is left to develope
it for himself, from the mere inspection of different examples of
colouring.]We have before remarked, that the propositions so
frequently referred to by the author, were never reduced into form,
though apparently he intended a regular work in which they were to be
included.][Footnote 68: No where in this work.][Footnote 69: This is evident in many of Vandyke's portraits,
particularly of ladies, many of whom are dressed in black velvet; and
this remark will in some measure account for the delicate fairness
which he frequently gives to the female complexion.][Footnote 70: These propositions, any more than the others mentioned
in different parts of this work, were never digested into a regular
treatise, as was evidently intended by the author, and consequently are
not to be found, except perhaps in some of the volumes of the author's
manuscript collections.][Footnote 73: This book on perspective was never drawn up.][Footnote 76: There is no work of this author to which this can at
present refer, but the principle is laid down in chapters cclxxxiv.[Footnote 77: See chapters cccvii.[Footnote 80: To our obtaining a correct idea of the magnitude and
distance of any object seen from afar, it is necessary that we consider
how much of distinctness an object loses at a distance (from the mere
interposition of the air), as well as what it loses in size; and these
two considerations must unite before we can decidedly pronounce as to
its distance or magnitude.This calculation, as to distinctness, must
be made upon the idea that the air is clear, as, if by any accident it
is otherwise, we shall (knowing the proportion in which clear air dims
a prospect) be led to conclude this farther off than it is, and, to
justify that conclusion, shall suppose its real magnitude correspondent
with the distance, at which from its degree of distinctness it appears
to be.In the circumstance remarked in the text there is, however, a
great deception; the fact is, that the colour and the minute parts of
the object are lost in the fog, while the size of it is not diminished
in proportion; and the eye being accustomed to see objects diminished
in size at a great distance, supposes this to be farther off than it
is, and consequently imagines it larger.][Footnote 81: This proposition, though undoubtedly intended to form a
part of some future work, which never was drawn up, makes no part of
the present.][Footnote 84: See chapter ccxcviii.][Footnote 85: This was probably to have been a part of some other work,
but it does not occur in this.][Footnote 86: Cento braccia, or cubits.The Florence braccio is one
foot ten inches seven eighths, English measure.][Footnote 87: Probably the Author here means yellow lilies, or fleurs
de lis.][Footnote 88: That point is always found in the horizon, and is called
the point of sight, or the vanishing point.][Footnote 91: This position has been already laid down in chapter
cxxiv.(and will also be found in chapter cccxlviii.); and the reader
is referred to the note on that passage, which will also explain that
in the text, for further illustration.It may, however, be proper to
remark, that though the author has here supposed both objects conveyed
to the eye by an angle of the same extent, they cannot, in fact, be so
seen, unless one eye be shut; and the reason is this: if viewed with
both eyes, there will be two points of sight, one in the centre of each
eye; and the rays from each of these to the objects must of course be
different, and will consequently form different angles.][Footnote 92: The braccio is one foot ten inches and seven eighths
English measure.]To be abridged according to the rules of
perspective.][Footnote 95: The whole of this chapter, like the next but one
preceding, depends on the circumstance of there being in fact two
points of sight, one in the centre of each eye, when an object is
viewed with both eyes.In natural objects the effect which this
circumstance produces is, that the rays from each point of sight,
diverging as they extend towards the object, take in not only that, but
some part also of the distance behind it, till at length, at a certain
distance behind it, they cross each other; whereas, in a painted
representation, there being no real distance behind the object, but the
whole being a flat surface, it is impossible that the rays from the
points of sight should pass beyond that flat surface; and as the object
itself is on that flat surface, which is the real extremity of the
view, the eyes cannot acquire a sight of any thing beyond.][Footnote 96: A well-known painter at Florence, contemporary with
Leonardo da Vinci, who painted several altar-pieces and other public
works.][Footnote 100: Leonardo da Vinci was remarkably fond of this kind of
invention, and is accused of having lost a great deal of time that way.][Footnote 101: The method here recommended, was the general and common
practice at that time, and continued so with little, if any variation,
till lately.But about thirty years ago, the late Mr.Bacon invented
an entirely new method, which, as better answering the purpose,
he constantly used, and from him others have also adopted it into
practice.][Footnote 102: This may be a good method of dividing the figure for the
purpose of reducing from large to small, or _vice versa_; but it not
being the method generally used by the painters for measuring their
figures, as being too minute, this chapter was not introduced amongst
those of general proportions.]When the men went there to 'do
it up' they found the interior of the house in a state of indescribable
filth: the ceilings discoloured with smoke and hung with cobwebs, the
wallpapers smeared and black with grease, the handrails and the newel
posts of the staircase were clammy with filth, and the edges of the
doors near the handles were blackened with greasy dirt and
finger-marks.The tops of the skirtings, the mouldings of the doors,
the sashes of the windows and the corners of the floors were thick with
the accumulated dust of years.In one of the upper rooms which had evidently been used as a nursery or
playroom for the children of the renowned chef, the wallpaper for about
two feet above the skirting was blackened with grease and ornamented
with childish drawings made with burnt sticks and blacklead pencils,
the door being covered with similar artistic efforts, to say nothing of
some rude attempts at carving, evidently executed with an axe or a
hammer.But all this filth was nothing compared with the unspeakable
condition of the kitchen and scullery, a detailed description of which
would cause the blood of the reader to curdle, and each particular hair
of his head to stand on end.Let it suffice to say that the walls, the ceiling, the floor, the
paintwork, the gas-stove, the kitchen range, the dresser and everything
else were uniformly absolutely and literally--black.And the black was
composed of soot and grease.In front of the window there was a fixture--a kind of bench or table,
deeply scored with marks of knives like a butcher's block.The sill of
the window was about six inches lower than the top of the table, so
that between the glass of the lower sash of the window, which had
evidently never been raised, and the back of the table, there was a
long narrow cavity or trough, about six inches deep, four inches wide
and as long as the width of the window, the sill forming the bottom of
the cavity.This trough was filled with all manner of abominations: fragments of
fat and decomposed meat, legs of rabbits and fowls, vegetable matter,
broken knives and forks, and hair: and the glass of the window was
caked with filth of the same description.This job was the cause of the sacking of the Semi-drunk and another man
named Bill Bates, who were sent into the kitchen to clean it down and
prepare it for painting and distempering.They commenced to do it, but it made them feel so ill that they went
out and had a pint each, and after that they made another start at it.But it was not long before they felt that it was imperatively necessary
to have another drink.So they went over to the pub, and this time
they had two pints each.Bill paid for the first two and then the
Semi-drunk refused to return to work unless Bill would consent to have
another pint with him before going back.When they had drunk the two
pints, they decided--in order to save themselves the trouble and risk
of coming away from the job--to take a couple of quarts back with them
in two bottles, which the landlord of the pub lent them, charging
twopence on each bottle, to be refunded when they were returned.When they got back to the job they found the 'coddy' in the kitchen,
looking for them and he began to talk and grumble, but the Semi-drunk
soon shut him up: he told him he could either have a drink out of one
of the bottles or a punch in the bloody nose--whichever he liked!Or
if he did not fancy either of these alternatives, he could go to hell!As the 'coddy' was a sensible man he took the beer and advised them to
pull themselves together and try to get some work done before Misery
came, which they promised to do.When the 'coddy' was gone they made another attempt at the work.Misery
came a little while afterwards and began shouting at them because he
said he could not see what they had done.It looked as if they had
been asleep all the morning: Here it was nearly ten o'clock, and as far
as he could see, they had done Nothing!When he was gone they drank the rest of the beer and then they began to
feel inclined to laugh.What did they care for Hunter or Rushton
either?They left off scraping and
scrubbing, and began throwing buckets of water over the dresser and the
walls, laughing uproariously all the time.'We'll show the b--s how to wash down paintwork!'shouted the
Semi-drunk, as he stood in the middle of the room and hurled a pailful
of water over the door of the cupboard.'Bring us another bucket of
water, Bill.'Bill was out in the scullery filling his pail under the tap, and
laughing so much that he could scarcely stand.As soon as it was full
he passed it to the Semi-drunk, who threw it bodily, pail and all, on
to the bench in front of the window, smashing one of the panes of
glass.The water poured off the table and all over the floor.Bill brought the next pailful in and threw it at the kitchen door,
splitting one of the panels from top to bottom, and then they threw
about half a dozen more pailfuls over the dresser.'We'll show the b--rs how to clean paintwork,' they shouted, as they
hurled the buckets at the walls and doors.By this time the floor was deluged with water, which mingled with the
filth and formed a sea of mud.They left the two taps running in the scullery and as the waste pipe of
the sink was choked up with dirt, the sink filled up and overflowed
like a miniature Niagara.The water ran out under the doors into the back-yard, and along the
passage out to the front door.But Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk
remained in the kitchen, smashing the pails at the walls and doors and
the dresser, and cursing and laughing hysterically.They had just filled the two buckets and were bringing them into the
kitchen when they heard Hunter's voice in the passage, shouting out
inquiries as to where all that water came from.Then they heard him
advancing towards them and they stood waiting for him with the pails in
their hands, and directly he opened the door and put his head into the
room they let fly the two pails at him.Unfortunately, they were too
drunk and excited to aim straight.One pail struck the middle rail of
the door and the other the wall by the side of it.Misery hastily shut the door again and ran upstairs, and presently the
'coddy' came down and called out to them from the passage.They went out to see what he wanted, and he told them that Misery had
gone to the office to get their wages ready: they were to make out
their time sheets and go for their money at once.Misery had said that
if they were not there in ten minutes he would have the pair of them
locked up.The Semi-drunk said that nothing would suit them better than to have
all their pieces at once--they had spent all their money and wanted
another drink.Bill Bates concurred, so they borrowed a piece of
blacklead pencil from the 'coddy' and made out their time sheets, took
off their aprons, put them into their tool bags, and went to the office
for their money, which Misery passed out to them through the trap-door.The news of this exploit spread all over the town during that day and
evening, and although it was in July, the next morning at six o'clock
there were half a dozen men waiting at the yard to ask Misery if there
was 'any chance of a job'.Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk had had their spree and had got the sack
for it and most of the chaps said it served them right.Such conduct
as that was going too far.Most of them would have said the same thing no matter what the
circumstances might have been.They had very little sympathy for each
other at any time.Often, when, for instance, one man was sent away from one 'job' to
another, the others would go into his room and look at the work he had
been doing, and pick out all the faults they could find and show them
to each other, making all sorts of ill-natured remarks about the absent
one meanwhile.'Jist run yer nose over that door, Jim,' one would say
in a tone of disgust.Did yer ever see sich a
mess in yer life?And the other man would
shake his head sadly and say that although the one who had done it had
never been up to much as a workman, he could do it a bit better than
that if he liked, but the fact was that he never gave himself time to
do anything properly: he was always tearing his bloody guts out!Why,
he'd only been in this room about four hours from start to finish!He
ought to have a watering cart to follow him about, because he worked at
such a hell of a rate you couldn't see him for dust!And then the
first man would reply that other people could do as they liked, but for
his part, HE was not going to tear his guts out for nobody!The second man would applaud these sentiments and say that he wasn't
going to tear his out either: and then they would both go back to their
respective rooms and tear into the work for all they were worth, making
the same sort of 'job' as the one they had been criticizing, and
afterwards, when the other's back was turned, each of them in turn
would sneak into the other's room and criticize it and point out the
faults to anyone else who happened to be near at hand.Harlow was working at the place that had been Macaroni's Cafe when one
day a note was sent to him from Hunter at the shop.It was written on
a scrap of wallpaper, and worded in the usual manner of such notes--as
if the writer had studied how to avoid all suspicion of being unduly
civil:

    Harlow go to the yard at once take your tools with you.Crass will tell you where you have to go.They were just finishing their dinners when the boy brought this note;
and after reading it aloud for the benefit of the others, Harlow
remarked that it was worded in much the same way in which one would
speak to a dog.The others said nothing; but after he was gone the
other men--who all considered that it was ridiculous for the 'likes of
us' to expect or wish to be treated with common civility--laughed about
it, and said that Harlow was beginning to think he was Somebody: they
supposed it was through readin' all those books what Owen was always
lendin' 'im.And then one of them got a piece of paper and wrote a
note to be given to Harlow at the first opportunity.This note was
properly worded, written in a manner suitable for a gentleman like him,
neatly folded and addressed:


    Mr Harlow Esq.,
      c/o Macaroni's Royal Cafe
        till called for.Mister Harlow,
      Dear Sir: Wood you kinely oblige me bi cummin to the paint shop
    as soon as you can make it convenient as there is a sealin' to be
    wite-woshed hoppin this is not trubbling you to much

                                                  I remane
                                                  Yours respeckfully
                                                       Pontius Pilate.This note was read out for the amusement of the company and afterwards
stored away in the writer's pocket till such a time as an opportunity
should occur of giving it to Harlow.As the writer of the note was on his way back to his room to resume
work he was accosted by a man who had gone into Harlow's room to
criticize it, and had succeeded in finding several faults which he
pointed out to the other, and of course they were both very much
disgusted with Harlow.'I can't think why the coddy keeps him on the job,' said the first man.'Between you and me, if I had charge of a job, and Misery sent Harlow
there--I'd send 'im back to the shop.''Same as you,' agreed the other as he went back to tear into his own
room.'Same as you, old man: I shouldn't 'ave 'im neither.'It must not be supposed from this that either of these two men were on
exceptionally bad terms with Harlow; they were just as good friends
with him--to his face--as they were with each other--to each other's
faces--and it was just their way: that was all.If it had been one or both of these two who had gone away instead of
Harlow, just the same things would have been said about them by the
others who remained--it was merely their usual way of speaking about
each other behind each other's backs.It was always the same: if any one of them made a mistake or had an
accident or got into any trouble he seldom or never got any sympathy
from his fellow workmen.On the contrary, most of them at such times
seemed rather pleased than otherwise.There was a poor devil--a stranger in the town; he came from
London--who got the sack for breaking some glass.He had been sent to
'burn off' some old paint of the woodwork of a window.He was not very
skilful in the use of the burning-off lamp, because on the firm when he
had been working in London it was a job that the ordinary hands were
seldom or never called upon to do.There were one or two men who did
it all.For that matter, not many of Rushton's men were very skilful
at it either.It was a job everybody tried to get out of, because
nearly always the lamp went wrong and there was a row about the time
the work took.So they worked this job on to the stranger.This man had been out of work for a long time before he got a start at
Rushton's, and he was very anxious not to lose the job, because he had
a wife and family in London.When the 'coddy' told him to go and burn
off this window he did not like to say that he was not used to the
work: he hoped to be able to do it.But he was very nervous, and the
end was that although he managed to do the burning off all right, just
as he was finishing he accidentally allowed the flame of the lamp to
come into contact with a large pane of glass and broke it.They sent to the shop for a new pane of glass, and the man stayed late
that night and put it in in his own time, thus bearing half the cost of
repairing it.Things were not very busy just then, and on the following Saturday two
of the hands were'stood off'.The stranger was one of them, and
nearly everybody was very pleased.At mealtimes the story of the
broken window was repeatedly told amid jeering laughter.It really
seemed as if a certain amount of indignation was felt that a
stranger--especially such an inferior person as this chap who did not
know how to use a lamp--should have had the cheek to try to earn his
living at all!One thing was very certain--they said, gleefully--he
would never get another job at Rushton's: that was one good thing.And yet they all knew that this accident might have happened to any one
of them.Once a couple of men got the sack because a ceiling they distempered
had to be washed off and done again.It was not really the men's fault
at all: it was a ceiling that needed special treatment and they had not
been allowed to do it properly.But all the same, when they got the sack most of the others laughed and
sneered and were glad.Perhaps because they thought that the fact that
these two unfortunates had been disgraced, increased their own chances
of being 'kept on'.With a few
exceptions, they had an immense amount of respect for Rushton and
Hunter, and very little respect or sympathy for each other.Exactly the same lack of feeling for each other prevailed amongst the
members of all the different trades.Everybody seemed glad if anybody
got into trouble for any reason whatever.There was a garden gate that had been made at the carpenter's shop: it
was not very well put together, and for the usual reason; the man had
not been allowed the time to do it properly.After it was fixed, one
of his shopmates wrote upon it with lead pencil in big letters: 'This
is good work for a joiner.But to hear them talking in the pub of a Saturday afternoon just after
pay-time one would think them the best friends and mates and the most
independent spirits in the world, fellows whom it would be very
dangerous to trifle with, and who would stick up for each other through
thick and thin.All sorts of stories were related of the wonderful
things they had done and said; of jobs they had 'chucked up', and
masters they had 'told off': of pails of whitewash thrown over
offending employers, and of horrible assaults and batteries committed
upon the same.But strange to say, for some reason or other, it seldom
happened that a third party ever witnessed any of these prodigies.It
seemed as if a chivalrous desire to spare the feelings of their victims
had always prevented them from doing or saying anything to them in the
presence of witnesses.When he had drunk a few pints, Crass was a very good hand at these
stories.Here is one that he told in the bar of the Cricketers on the
Saturday afternoon of the same week that Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk
got the sack.The Cricketers was only a few minutes walk from the shop
and at pay-time a number of the men used to go in there to take a drink
before going home.'Last Thursday night about five o'clock, 'Unter comes inter the
paint-shop an' ses to me, "I wants a pail o' wash made up tonight,
Crass," 'e ses, "ready for fust thing in the mornin'," 'e ses."Oh," I
ses, lookin' 'im straight in the bloody eye, "Oh, yer do, do
yer?""Well, you can bloody well make
it yerself!"I ses, "'cos I ain't agoin' to," I ses--just like that."Wot the 'ell do yer mean," I ses, "by comin' 'ere at this time o'
night with a order like that?"You'd a larfed,' continued
Crass, as he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand after taking
another drink out of his glass, and looking round to note the effect of
the story, 'you'd a larfed if you'd bin there.'E was fairly
flabbergasted!And wen I said that to 'im I see 'is jaw drop!An'
then 'e started apoligizing and said as 'e 'adn't meant no offence, but
I told 'im bloody straight not to come no more of it."You bring the
horder at a reasonable time," I ses--just like that--"and I'll attend
to it," I ses, "but not otherwise," I ses.'As he concluded this story, Crass drained his glass and gazed round
upon the audience, who were full of admiration.They looked at each
other and at Crass and nodded their heads approvingly.Yes,
undoubtedly, that was the proper way to deal with such bounders as
Nimrod; take up a strong attitude, an' let 'em see as you'll stand no
nonsense!'Yer don't blame me, do yer?''Why should we put up
with a lot of old buck from the likes of 'im!We're not a lot of
bloody Chinamen, are we?'So far from blaming him, they all assured him that they would have
acted in precisely the same way under similar circumstances.'For my part, I'm a bloke like this,' said a tall man with a very loud
voice--a chap who nearly fell down dead every time Rushton or Misery
looked at him.'I'm a bloke like this 'ere: I never stands no cheek
from no gaffers!If a guv'nor ses two bloody words to me, I downs me
tools and I ses to 'im, "Wot!Don't I suit yer, guv'ner?Ain't I done
enuff for yer?Gimmie me bleedin' a'pence."'If
only everyone would do the same as the tall man--who had just paid for
another round of drinks--things would be a lot more comfortable than
they was.'Last summer I was workin' for ole Buncer,' said a little man with a
cutaway coat several sizes too large for him.'I was workin' for ole
Buncer, over at Windley, an' you all knows as 'e don't arf lower it.Well, one day, when I knowed 'e was on the drunk, I 'ad to first coat a
room out--white; so thinks I to meself, "If I buck up I shall be able
to get this lot done by about four o'clock, an' then I can clear orf
'ome.'Cos I reckoned as 'e'd be about flattened out by that time, an'
you know 'e ain't got no foreman.So I tears into it an' gets this
'ere room done about a quarter past four, an' I'd just got me things
put away for the night w'en 'oo should come fallin' up the bloody
stairs but ole Buncer, drunk as a howl!An' no sooner 'e gits inter
the room than 'e starts yappin' an' rampin'.""Is this 'ere hall
you've done?""Wotcher bin up to hall day?"'e ses, an'
'e keeps on shouting' an' swearin' till at last I couldn't stand it no
longer, 'cos you can guess I wasn't in a very good temper with 'im
comin' along jist then w'en I thought I was goin' to get orf a bit
early--so w'en 'e kept on shoutin' I never made no answer to 'im, but
ups with me fist an' I gives 'im a slosh in the dial an' stopped 'is
clock!Then I chucked the pot o' w'ite paint hover 'im, an' kicked 'im
down the bloody stairs.''Serve 'im blooming well right, too,' said Crass as he took a fresh
glass of beer from one of the others, who had just'stood' another
round.'What did the b--r say to that?'replied the little man, ''E picked 'isself up, and
called a keb wot was passin' an' got inter it an' went 'ome; an' I
never seen no more of 'im until about 'arf-past eleven the next day,
w'en I was second-coatin' the room, an' 'e comes up with a noo suit o'
clothes on, an' arsts me if I'd like to come hover to the pub an' 'ave
a drink?So we goes hover, an' 'e calls for a w'iskey an' soda for
isself an' arsts me wot I'd 'ave, so I 'ad the same.An' w'ile we was
gettin' it down us, 'e ses to me, "Ah, Garge," 'e ses."You losed your
temper with me yesterday,"' 'e ses.'If you 'adn't served 'im as you did you'd most likely 'ave 'ad to
put up with a lot more ole buck.'They all agreed that the little man had done quite right: they all said
that they didn' blame him in the least: they would all have done the
same: in fact, this was the way they all conducted themselves whenever
occasion demanded it.To hear them talk, one would imagine that such
affairs as the recent exploit of Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk were
constantly taking place, instead of only occurring about once in a blue
moon.Crass stood the final round of drinks, and as he evidently thought that
circumstance deserved to be signalized in some special manner, he
proposed the following toast, which was drunk with enthusiasm:

        'To hell with the man,
        May he never grow fat,
        What carries two faces,
        Under one 'at.'They did not have many
big jobs, but there were a lot of little ones, and the boy Bert was
kept busy running from one to the other.He spent most of his time
dragging a handcart with loads of paint, or planks and steps, and
seldom went out to work with the men, for when he was not taking things
out to the various places where the philanthropists were working, he
was in the paintshop at the yard, scraping out dirty paint-pots or
helping Crass to mix up colours.Although scarcely anyone seemed to
notice it, the boy presented a truly pitiable spectacle.Dragging the handcart did not help him to put on flesh,
for the weather was very hot and the work made him sweat.His home was right away on the other side of Windley.It took him more
than three-quarters of an hour to walk to the shop, and as he had to be
at work at six, that meant that he had to leave home at a few minutes
past five every morning, so that he always got up about half past four.He was wearing a man's coat--or rather jacket--which gave the upper
part of his body a bulky appearance.The trousers were part of a suit
of his own, and were somewhat narrowly cut, as is the rule with boys'
cheap ready-made trousers.These thin legs appearing under the big
jacket gave him a rather grotesque appearance, which was heightened by
the fact that all his clothes, cap, coat, waistcoat, trousers and
boots, were smothered with paint and distemper of various colours, and
there were generally a few streaks of paint of some sort or other upon
his face, and of course his hands--especially round the
fingernails--were grimed with it.But the worst of all were the
dreadful hobnailed boots: the leather of the uppers of these was an
eighth of an inch thick, and very stiff.Across the fore part of the
boot this hard leather had warped into ridges and valleys, which chafed
his feet, and made them bleed.The soles were five-eighths of an inch
thick, covered with hobnails, and were as hard and inflexible and
almost as heavy as iron.These boots hurt his feet dreadfully and made
him feel very tired and miserable, for he had such a lot of walking to
do.He used to be jolly glad when dinner-time came, for then he used to
get out of sight in some quiet spot and lie down for the whole hour.His favourite dining-place was up in the loft over the carpenter's
shop, where they stored the mouldings and architraves.No one ever
came there at that hour, and after he had eaten his dinner he used to
lie down and think and rest.He nearly always had an hour for dinner, but he did not always have it
at the same time: sometimes he had it at twelve o'clock and sometimes
not till two.It all depended upon what stuff had to be taken to the
job.Often it happened that some men at a distant job required some material
to use immediately after dinner, and perhaps Crass was not able to get
it ready till twelve o'clock, so that it was not possible to take it
before dinner-time, and if Bert left it till after dinner the men would
be wasting their time waiting for it: so in such cases he took it there
first and had his dinner when he came back.Sometimes he got back about half past twelve, and it was necessary for
him to take out another lot of material at one o'clock.In such a case he 'charged' half an hour overtime on his time sheet--he
used to get twopence an hour for overtime.Sometimes Crass sent him with a handcart to one job to get a pair of
steps or tressels, or a plank, or some material or other, and take them
to another job, and on these occasions it was often very late before he
was able to take his meals.Instead of getting his breakfast at eight,
it was often nearly nine before he got back to the shop, and frequently
he had to go without dinner until half past one or two.Sometimes he could scarcely manage to carry the pots of paint to the
jobs; his feet were so hot and sore.When he had to push the cart it
was worse still, and often when knocking-off time came he felt so tired
that he could scarcely manage to walk home.But the weather was not always hot or fine: sometimes it was quite
cold, almost like winter, and there was a lot of rain that summer.At
such times the boy frequently got wet through several times a day as he
went from one job to another, and he had to work all the time in his
wet clothes and boots, which were usually old and out of repair and let
in the water.One of the worst jobs that he had to do was when a new stock of white
lead came in.This stuff came in wooden barrels containing two
hundredweight, and he used to have to dig it out of these barrels with
a trowel, and put it into a metal tank, where it was kept covered with
water, and the empty barrels were returned to the makers.When he was doing this work he usually managed to get himself smeared
all over with the white lead, and this circumstance, and the fact that
he was always handling paint or some poisonous material or other was
doubtless the cause of the terrible pains he often had in his
stomach--pains that sometimes caused him to throw himself down and roll
on the ground in agony.One afternoon Crass sent him with a handcart to a job that Easton,
Philpot, Harlow and Owen were just finishing.He got there about half
past four and helped the men to load up the things, and afterwards
walked alongside the cart with them back to the shop.On the way they all noticed and remarked to each other that the boy
looked tired and pale and that he seemed to limp: but he did not say
anything, although he guessed that they were talking about him.They
arrived at the shop a little before knocking-off time--about ten
minutes past five.Bert helped them to unload, and afterwards, while
they were putting their things away and 'charging up' the unused
materials they had brought back, he pushed the cart over to the shed
where it was kept, on the other side of the yard.He did not return to
the shop at once and a few minutes later when Harlow came out into the
yard to get a bucket of water to wash their hands with, he saw the boy
leaning on the side of the cart, crying, and holding one foot off the
ground.Harlow asked him what was the matter, and while he was speaking to him
the others came out to see what was up: the boy said he had rheumatism
or growing pains or something in his leg, 'just here near the knee'.But he didn't say much, he just cried miserably, and turned his head
slowly from side to side, avoiding the looks of the men because he felt
ashamed that they should see him cry.When they saw how ill and miserable he looked, the men all put their
hands in their pockets to get some coppers to give to him so that he
could ride home on the tram.They gave him fivepence altogether, more
than enough to ride all the way; and Crass told him to go at
once--there was no need to wait till half past; but before he went
Philpot got a small glass bottle out of his tool bag and filled it with
oil and turps--two of turps and one of oil--which he gave to Bert to
rub into his leg before going to bed: The turps--he explained--was to
cure the pain and the oil was to prevent it from hurting the skin.He
was to get his mother to rub it in for him if he were too tired to do
it himself.Bert promised to observe these directions, and, drying his
tears, took his dinner basket and limped off to catch the tram.It was a few days after this that Hunter met with an accident.He was
tearing off on his bicycle to one of the jobs about five minutes to
twelve to see if he could catch anyone leaving off for dinner before
the proper time, and while going down a rather steep hill the
front brake broke--the rubbers of the rear one were worn out and failed
to act--so Misery to save himself from being smashed against the
railings of the houses at the bottom of the hill, threw himself off the
machine, with the result that his head and face and hands were terribly
cut and bruised.He was so badly knocked about that he had to remain
at home for nearly three weeks, much to the delight of the men and the
annoyance--one might even say the indignation--of Mr Rushton, who did
not know enough about the work to make out estimates without
assistance.There were several large jobs to be tendered for at the
same time, so Rushton sent the specifications round to Hunter's house
for him to figure out the prices, and nearly all the time that Misery
was at home he was sitting up in bed, swathed in bandages, trying to
calculate the probable cost of these jobs.Rushton did not come to see
him, but he sent Bert nearly every day, either with some
specifications, or some accounts, or something of that sort, or with a
note inquiring when Hunter thought he would be able to return to work.All sorts of rumours became prevalent amongst the men concerning
Hunter's condition.He had 'broken his spiral column', he had
'conjunction of the brain', or he had injured his 'innards' and would
probably never be able to 'do no more slave-drivin''.Crass--who had
helped Mr Rushton to 'price up' several small jobs--began to think it
might not be altogether a bad thing for himself if something were to
happen to Hunter, and he began to put on side and to assume airs of
authority.He got one of the light-weights to assist him in his work
of colourman and made him do all the hard work, while he spent part of
his own time visiting the different jobs to see how the work progressed.He was wearing a pair of sporting
trousers the pattern of which consisted of large black and white
squares.The previous owner of these trousers was taller and slighter
than Crass, so although the legs were about a couple of inches too
long, they fitted him rather tightly, so much so that it was fortunate
that he had his present job of colourman, for if he had had to do any
climbing up and down ladders or steps, the trousers would have burst.His jacket was also two or three sizes too small, and the sleeves were
so short that the cuffs of his flanelette shirt were visible.This
coat was made of serge, and its colour had presumably once been blue,
but it was now a sort of heliotrope and violet: the greater part being
of the former tint, and the parts under the sleeves of the latter.This
jacket fitted very tightly across the shoulders and back and being much
too short left his tightly clad posteriors exposed to view.He however seemed quite unconscious of anything peculiar in his
appearance and was so bumptious and offensive that most of the men were
almost glad when Nimrod came back.They said that if Crass ever got
the job he would be a dam' sight worse than Hunter.As for the latter,
for a little while after his return to work it was said that his
illness had improved his character: he had had time to think things
over; and in short, he was ever so much better than before: but it was
not long before this story began to be told the other way round.and a thing that happened about a fortnight after
his return caused more ill feeling and resentment against him and
Rushton than had ever existed previously.What led up to it was
something that was done by Bundy's mate, Ted Dawson.This poor wretch was scarcely ever seen without a load of some sort or
other: carrying a sack of cement or plaster, a heavy ladder, a big
bucket of mortar, or dragging a load of scaffolding on a cart.He must
have been nearly as strong as a horse, because after working in this
manner for Rushton & Co.from six in the morning till half past five at
night, he usually went to work in his garden for two or three hours
after tea, and frequently went there for an hour or so in the morning
before going to work.The poor devil needed the produce of his garden
to supplement his wages, for he had a wife and three children to
provide for and he earned only--or rather, to be correct, he was paid
only--fourpence an hour.There was an old house to which they were making some alterations and
repairs, and there was a lot of old wood taken out of it: old, decayed
floorboards and stuff of that kind, wood that was of no use whatever
except to burn.Bundy and his mate were working there, and one night, Misery came a few
minutes before half past five and caught Dawson in the act of tying up
a small bundle of this wood.When Hunter asked him what he was going
to do with it he made no attempt at prevarication or concealment: he
said he was going to take it home for fire-wood, because it was of no
other use.Misery kicked up a devil of a row and ordered him to leave
the wood where it was: it had to be taken to the yard, and it was
nothing to do with Dawson or anyone else whether it was any use or not!If he caught anyone taking wood away he would sack them on the spot.Hunter shouted very loud so that all the others might hear, and as they
were all listening attentively in the next room, where they were taking
their aprons off preparatory to going home, they got the full benefit
of his remarks.The following Saturday when the hands went to the office for their
money they were each presented with a printed card bearing the
following legend:

    Under no circumstances is any article or material, however
    trifling, to be taken away by workmen for their private use,
    whether waste material or not, from any workshop or place where
    work is being done.Foremen are hereby instructed to see that
    this order is obeyed and to report any such act coming to their
    knowledge.Any man breaking this rule will be either dismissed
    without notice or given into custody.Most of the men took these cards with the envelopes containing their
wages and walked away without making any comment--in fact, most of them
were some distance away before they realized exactly what the card was
about.Two or three of them stood a few steps away from the pay window
in full view of Rushton and Misery and ostentatiously tore the thing
into pieces and threw them into the street.One man remained at the
pay window while he read the card--and then flung it with an obscene
curse into Rushton's face, and demanded his back day, which they gave
him without any remark or delay, the other men who were not yet paid
having to wait while he made out his time-sheet for that morning.The story of this card spread all over the place in a very short time.It became the talk of every shop in the town.Whenever any of
Rushton's men encountered the employees of another firm, the latter
used to shout after them--'However trifling!''Ere comes some of Rushton's pickpockets.'Amongst Rushton's men themselves it became a standing joke or form of
greeting to say when one met another--'Remember!If one of their number was seen going home with an unusual amount of
paint or whitewash on his hands or clothes, the others would threaten
to report him for stealing the material.They used to say that however
trifling the quantity, it was against orders to take it away.Harlow drew up a list of rules which he said Mr Rushton had instructed
him to communicate to the men.One of these rules provided that
everybody was to be weighed upon arrival at the job in the morning and
again at leaving-off time: any man found to have increased in weight
was to be discharged.There was also much cursing and covert resentment about it; the men
used to say that such a thing as that looked well coming from the likes
of Rushton and Hunter, and they used to remind each other of the affair
of the marble-topped console table, the barometer, the venetian blinds
and all the other robberies.None of them ever said anything to either Misery or Rushton about the
cards, but one morning when the latter was reading his letters at the
breakfast table, on opening one of them he found that it contained one
of the notices, smeared with human excrement.He did not eat any more
breakfast that morning.It was not to be much wondered at that none of them had the courage to
openly resent the conditions under which they had to work, for although
it was summer, there were many men out of employment, and it was much
easier to get the sack than it was to get another job.None of the men were ever caught stealing anything, however trifling,
but all the same during the course of the summer five or six of them
were captured by the police and sent to jail--for not being able to pay
their poor rates.All through the summer Owen continued to make himself objectionable and
to incur the ridicule of his fellow workmen by talking about the causes
of poverty and of ways to abolish it.Most of the men kept two shillings or half a crown of their wages back
from their wives for pocket money, which they spent on beer and
tobacco.There were a very few who spent a little more than this, and
there were a still smaller number who spent so much in this way that
their families had to suffer in consequence.Most of those who kept back half a crown or three shillings from their
wives did so on the understanding that they were to buy their clothing
out of it.Some of them had to pay a shilling a week to a tallyman or
credit clothier.These were the ones who indulged in shoddy new
suits--at long intervals.Others bought--or got their wives to buy for
them--their clothes at second-hand shops, 'paying off' about a shilling
or so a week and not receiving the things till they were paid for.There were a very large proportion of them who did not spend even a
shilling a week for drink: and there were numerous others who, while
not being formally total abstainers, yet often went for weeks together
without either entering a public house or tasting intoxicating drink in
any form.Then there were others who, instead of drinking tea or coffee or cocoa
with their dinners or suppers, drank beer.This did not cost more than
the teetotal drinks, but all the same there are some persons who say
that those who swell the 'Nation's Drink Bill' by drinking beer with
their dinners or suppers are a kind of criminal, and that they ought to
be compelled to drink something else: that is, if they are working
people.As for the idle classes, they of course are to be allowed to
continue to make merry, 'drinking whisky, wine and sherry', to say
nothing of having their beer in by the barrel and the dozen--or forty
dozen--bottles.But of course that's a different matter, because these
people make so much money out of the labour of the working classes that
they can afford to indulge in this way without depriving their children
of the necessaries of life.There is no more cowardly, dastardly slander than is contained in the
assertion that the majority or any considerable proportion of working
men neglect their families through drink.There
are some who do, but they are not even a large minority.They are few
and far between, and are regarded with contempt by their fellow workmen.It will be said that their families had to suffer for want of even the
little that most of them spent in that way: but the persons that use
this argument should carry it to its logical conclusion.Tea is an
unnecessary and harmful drink; it has been condemned by medical men so
often that to enumerate its evil qualities here would be waste of time.The same can be said of nearly all the cheap temperance drinks; they
are unnecessary and harmful and cost money, and, like beer, are drunk
only for pleasure.What right has anyone to say to working men that when their work is
done they should not find pleasure in drinking a glass or two of beer
together in a tavern or anywhere else?Let those who would presume to
condemn them carry their argument to its logical conclusion and condemn
pleasure of every kind.Let them persuade the working classes to lead
still simpler lives; to drink water instead of such unwholesome things
as tea, coffee, beer, lemonade and all the other harmful and
unnecessary stuff.They would then be able to live ever so much more
cheaply, and as wages are always and everywhere regulated by the cost
of living, they would be able to work for lower pay.These people are fond of quoting the figures of the 'Nation's Drink
Bill,' as if all this money were spent by the working classes!But if
the amount of money spent in drink by the 'aristocracy', the clergy and
the middle classes were deducted from the 'Nation's Drink Bill', it
would be seen that the amount spent per head by the working classes is
not so alarming after all; and would probably not be much larger than
the amount spent on drink by those who consume tea and coffee and all
the other unwholesome and unnecessary 'temperance' drinks.The fact that some of Rushton's men spent about two shillings a week on
drink while they were in employment was not the cause of their poverty.If they had never spent a farthing for drink, and if their wretched
wages had been increased fifty percent, they would still have been in a
condition of the most abject and miserable poverty, for nearly all the
benefits and privileges of civilization, nearly everything that makes
life worth living, would still have been beyond their reach.It is inevitable, so long as men have to live and work under such
heartbreaking, uninteresting conditions as at present that a certain
proportion of them will seek forgetfulness and momentary happiness in
the tavern, and the only remedy for this evil is to remove the cause;
and while that is in process, there is something else that can be done
and that is, instead of allowing filthy drinking dens, presided over by
persons whose interest it is to encourage men to drink more bad beer
than is good for them or than they can afford,--to have civilized
institutions run by the State or the municipalities for use and not
merely for profit.Decent pleasure houses, where no drunkenness or
filthiness would be tolerated--where one could buy real beer or coffee
or tea or any other refreshments; where men could repair when their
day's work was over and spend an hour or two in rational intercourse
with their fellows or listen to music and singing.Taverns to which
they could take their wives and children without fear of defilement,
for a place that is not fit for the presence of a woman or a child is
not fit to exist at all.Owen, being a teetotaller, did not spend any of his money on drink; but
he spent a lot on what he called 'The Cause'.Every week he bought
some penny or twopenny pamphlets or some leaflets about Socialism,
which he lent or gave to his mates; and in this way and by means of
much talk he succeeded in converting a few to his party.Philpot,
Harlow and a few others used to listen with interest, and some of them
even paid for the pamphlets they obtained from Owen, and after reading
them themselves, passed them on to others, and also occasionally 'got
up' arguments on their own accounts.Others were simply indifferent,
or treated the subject as a kind of joke, ridiculing the suggestion
that it was possible to abolish poverty.They repeated that there had
'always been rich and poor in the world and there always would be, so
there was an end of it'.But the majority were bitterly hostile; not
to Owen, but to Socialism.For the man himself most of them had a
certain amount of liking, especially the ordinary hands because it was
known that he was not a'master's man' and that he had declined to
'take charge' of jobs which Misery had offered to him.But to
Socialism they were savagely and malignantly opposed.Some of those
who had shown some symptoms of Socialism during the past winter when
they were starving had now quite recovered and were stout defenders of
the Present System.Barrington was still working for the firm and continued to maintain his
manner of reserve, seldom speaking unless addressed but all the same,
for several reasons, it began to be rumoured that he shared Owen's
views.He always paid for the pamphlets that Owen gave him, and on one
occasion, when Owen bought a thousand leaflets to give away, Barrington
contributed a shilling towards the half-crown that Owen paid for them.But he never took any part in the arguments that sometimes raged during
the dinner-hour or at breakfast-time.It was a good thing for Owen that he had his enthusiasm for 'the cause'
to occupy his mind.Socialism was to him what drink was to some of the
others--the thing that enable them to forget and tolerate the
conditions under which they were forced to exist.Some of them were so
muddled with beer, and others so besotted with admiration of their
Liberal and Tory masters, that they were oblivious of the misery of
their own lives, and in a similar way, Owen was so much occupied in
trying to rouse them from their lethargy and so engrossed in trying to
think out new arguments to convince them of the possibility of bringing
about an improvement in their condition that he had no time to dwell
upon his own poverty; the money that he spent on leaflets and pamphlets
to give away might have been better spent on food and clothing for
himself, because most of those to whom he gave them were by no means
grateful; but he never thought of that; and after all, nearly everyone
spends money on some hobby or other.Some people deny themselves the
necessaries or comforts of life in order that they may be able to help
to fatten a publican.Others deny themselves in order to enable a lazy
parson to live in idleness and luxury; and others spend much time and
money that they really need for themselves in buying Socialist
literature to give away to people who don't want to know about
Socialism.One Sunday morning towards the end of July, a band of about twenty-five
men and women on bicycles invaded the town.Two of them--who rode a
few yards in front of the others, had affixed to the handlebars of each
of their machines a slender, upright standard from the top of one of
which fluttered a small flag of crimson silk with 'International
Brotherhood and Peace' in gold letters.The other standard was similar
in size and colour, but with a different legend: 'One for all and All
for one.'As they rode along they gave leaflets to the people in the streets, and
whenever they came to a place where there were many people they
dismounted and walked about, giving their leaflets to whoever would
accept them.They made several long halts during their progress along
the Grand Parade, where there was a considerable crowd, and then they
rode over the hill to Windley, which they reached a little before
opening time.There were little crowds waiting outside the several
public houses and a number of people passing through the streets on
their way home from Church and Chapel.The strangers distributed
leaflets to all those who would take them, and they went through a lot
of the side streets, putting leaflets under the doors and in the
letter-boxes.When they had exhausted their stock they remounted and
rode back the way they came.Meantime the news of their arrival had spread, and as they returned
through the town they were greeted with jeers and booing.Presently
someone threw a stone, and as there happened to be plenty of stones
just there several others followed suit and began running after the
retreating cyclists, throwing stones, hooting and cursing.The leaflet which had given rise to all this fury read as follows:

                            WHAT IS SOCIALISM?At present the workers, with hand and brain produce continually
    food, clothing and all useful and beautiful things in great
    abundance.BUT THEY LABOUR IN VAIN--for they are mostly poor and often in
    want.Their women and
    children suffer, and their old age is branded with pauperism.Socialism is a plan by which poverty will be abolished, and
    everyone enabled to live in plenty and comfort, with leisure and
    opportunity for ampler life.If you wish to hear more of this plan, come to the field at the
    Cross Roads on the hill at Windley, on Tuesday evening next at 8
    P.M.and

                      LOOK OUT FOR THE SOCIALIST VAN

The cyclists rode away amid showers of stones without sustaining much
damage.One had his hand cut and another, who happened to look round,
was struck on the forehead, but these were the only casualties.On the following Tuesday evening, long before the appointed time, there
was a large crowd assembled at the cross roads or the hill at Windley,
waiting for the appearance of the van, and they were evidently prepared
to give the Socialists a warm reception.There was only one policeman
in uniform there but there were several in plain clothes amongst the
crowd.Crass, Dick Wantley, the Semi-drunk, Sawkins, Bill Bates and several
other frequenters of the Cricketers were amongst the crowd, and there
were also a sprinkling of tradespeople, including the Old Dear and Mr
Smallman, the grocer, and a few ladies and gentlemen--wealthy
visitors--but the bulk of the crowd were working men, labourers,
mechanics and boys.As it was quite evident that the crowd meant mischief--many of them had
their pockets filled with stones and were armed with sticks--several of
the Socialists were in favour of going to meet the van to endeavour to
persuade those in charge from coming, and with that object they
withdrew from the crowd, which was already regarding them with menacing
looks, and went down the road in the direction from which the van was
expected to come.They had not gone very far, however, before the
people, divining what they were going to do, began to follow them and
while they were hesitating what course to pursue, the Socialist van,
escorted by five or six men on bicycles, appeared round the corner at
the bottom of the hill.As soon as the crowd saw it, they gave an exultant cheer, or, rather,
yell, and began running down the hill to meet it, and in a few minutes
it was surrounded by a howling mob.The van was drawn by two horses;
there was a door and a small platform at the back and over this was a
sign with white letters on a red ground: 'Socialism, the only hope of
the Workers.'The driver pulled up, and another man on the platform at the rear
attempted to address the crowd, but his voice was inaudible in the din
of howls, catcalls, hooting and obscene curses.After about an hour of
this, as the crowd began pushing against the van and trying to overturn
it, the terrified horses commenced to get restive and uncontrollable,
and the man on the box attempted to drive up the hill.This seemed to
still further infuriate the horde of savages who surrounded the van.Numbers of them clutched the wheels and turned them the reverse way,
screaming that it must go back to where it came from; several of them
accordingly seized the horses' heads and, amid cheers, turned them
round.The man on the platform was still trying to make himself heard, but
without success.The strangers who had come with the van and the
little group of local Socialists, who had forced their way through the
crowd and gathered together close to the platform in front of the
would-be speaker, only increased the din by their shouts of appeal to
the crowd to 'give the man a fair chance'.This little bodyguard
closed round the van as it began to move slowly downhill, but they were
not sufficiently numerous to protect it from the crowd, which, not
being satisfied with the rate at which the van was proceeding, began to
shout to each other to 'Run it away!'and several
savage rushes were made with the intention of putting these suggestions
into execution.Some of the defenders were hampered with their bicycles, but they
resisted as well as they were able, and succeeded in keeping the crowd
off until the foot of the hill was reached, and then someone threw the
first stone, which by a strange chance happened to strike one of the
cyclists whose head was already bandaged--it was the same man who had
been hit on the Sunday.This stone was soon followed by others, and
the man on the platform was the next to be struck.He got it right on
the mouth, and as he put up his handkerchief to staunch the blood
another struck him on the forehead just above the temple, and he
dropped forward on his face on to the platform as if he had been shot.As the speed of the vehicle increased, a regular hail of stones fell
upon the roof and against the sides of the van and whizzed past the
retreating cyclists, while the crowd followed close behind, cheering,
shrieking out volleys of obscene curses, and howling like wolves.'We'll give the b--rs Socialism!'shouted Crass, who was literally
foaming at the mouth.'We'll teach 'em to come 'ere trying to undermined our bloody
morality,' howled Dick Wantley as he hurled a lump of granite that he
had torn up from the macadamized road at one of the cyclists.They ran on after the van until it was out of range, and then they
bethought themselves of the local Socialists; but they were nowhere to
be seen; they had prudently withdrawn as soon as the van had got fairly
under way, and the victory being complete, the upholders of the present
system returned to the piece of waste ground on the top of the hill,
where a gentleman in a silk hat and frockcoat stood up on a little
hillock and made a speech.He said nothing about the Distress
Committee or the Soup Kitchen or the children who went to school
without proper clothes or food, and made no reference to what was to be
done next winter, when nearly everybody would be out of work.These
were matters he and they were evidently not at all interested in.But
he said a good deal about the Glorious Empire!The things he said were received with rapturous
applause, and at the conclusion of his address, the crowd sang the
National Anthem with great enthusiasm and dispersed, congratulating
themselves that they had shown to the best of their ability what
Mugsborough thought of Socialism and the general opinion of the crowd
was that they would hear nothing more from the Socialist van.But in this they were mistaken, for the very next Sunday evening a
crowd of Socialists suddenly materialized at the Cross Roads.Some of
them had come by train, others had walked from different places and
some had cycled.A crowd gathered and the Socialists held a meeting, two speeches being
delivered before the crowd recovered from their surprise at the
temerity of these other Britishers who apparently had not sense enough
to understand that they had been finally defeated and obliterated last
Tuesday evening: and when the cyclist with the bandaged head got up on
the hillock some of the crowd actually joined in the hand-clapping with
which the Socialists greeted him.In the course of his speech he informed them that the man who had come
with the van and who had been felled whilst attempting to speak from
the platform was now in hospital.For some time it had been probable
that he would not recover, but he was now out of danger, and as soon as
he was well enough there was no doubt that he would come there again.Upon this Crass shouted out that if ever the Vanners did return, they
would finish what they had begun last Tuesday.He would not get off so
easy next time.But when he said this, Crass--not being able to see
into the future--did not know what the reader will learn in due time,
that the man was to return to that place under different circumstances.When they had finished their speech-making one of the strangers who was
acting as chairman invited the audience to put questions, but as nobody
wanted to ask any, he invited anyone who disagreed with what had been
said to get up on the hillock and state his objections, so that the
audience might have an opportunity of judging for themselves which side
was right; but this invitation was also neglected.Then the chairman
announced that they were coming there again next Sunday at the same
time, when a comrade would speak on 'Unemployment and Poverty, the
Cause and the Remedy', and then the strangers sang a song called
'England Arise', the first verse being:

        England Arise, the long, long night is over,
        Faint in the east, behold the Dawn appear
        Out of your evil dream of toil and sorrow
        Arise, O England!During the progress of the meeting several of the strangers had been
going out amongst the crowd giving away leaflets, which many of the
people gloomily refused to accept, and selling penny pamphlets, of
which they managed to dispose of about three dozen.Before declaring the meeting closed, the chairman said that the speaker
who was coming next week resided in London: he was not a millionaire,
but a workman, the same as nearly all those who were there present.They were not going to pay him anything for coming, but they intended
to pay his railway fare.Therefore next Sunday after the meeting there
would be a collection, and anything over the amount of the fare would
be used for the purchase of more leaflets such as those they were now
giving away.He hoped that anyone who thought that any of the money
went into the pockets of those who held the meeting would come and
join: then they could have their share.The meeting now terminated and the Socialists were suffered to depart
in peace.Some of them, however, lingered amongst the crowd after the
main body had departed, and for a long time after the meeting was over
little groups remained on the field excitedly discussing the speeches
or the leaflets.The next Sunday evening when the Socialists came they found the field
at the Cross Roads in the possession of a furious, hostile mob, who
refused to allow them to speak, and finally they had to go away without
having held a meeting.They came again the next Sunday, and on this
occasion they had a speaker with a very loud--literally a
stentorian--voice, and he succeeded in delivering an address, but as
only those who were very close were able to hear him, and as they were
all Socialists, it was not of much effect upon those for whom it was
intended.They came again the next Sunday and nearly every other Sunday during
the summer: sometimes they were permitted to hold their meeting in
comparative peace and at other times there was a row.They made
several converts, and many people declared themselves in favour of some
of the things advocated, but they were never able to form a branch of
their society there, because nearly all those who were convinced were
afraid to publicly declare themselves lest they should lose their
employment or customers.Chapter 44

The Beano


Now and then a transient gleam of sunshine penetrated the gloom in
which the lives of the philanthropists were passed.The cheerless
monotony was sometimes enlivened with a little innocent merriment.Every now and then there was a funeral which took Misery and Crass away
for the whole afternoon, and although they always tried to keep the
dates secret, the men generally knew when they were gone.Sometimes the people in whose houses they were working regaled them
with tea, bread and butter, cake or other light refreshments, and
occasionally even with beer--very different stuff from the petrifying
liquid they bought at the Cricketers for twopence a pint.At other
places, where the people of the house were not so generously disposed,
the servants made up for it, and entertained them in a similar manner
without the knowledge of their masters and mistresses.Even when the
mistresses were too cunning to permit of this, they were seldom able to
prevent the men from embracing the domestics, who for their part were
quite often willing to be embraced; it was an agreeable episode that
helped to vary the monotony of their lives, and there was no harm done.It was rather hard lines on the philanthropists sometimes when they
happened to be working in inhabited houses of the better sort.They
always had to go in and out by the back way, generally through the
kitchen, and the crackling and hissing of the poultry and the joints of
meat roasting in the ovens, and the odours of fruit pies and tarts, and
plum puddings and sage and onions, were simply maddening.In the
back-yards of these houses there were usually huge stacks of empty
beer, stout and wine bottles, and others that had contained whisky,
brandy or champagne.The smells of the delicious viands that were being prepared in the
kitchen often penetrated into the dismantled rooms that the
philanthropists were renovating, sometimes just as they were eating
their own wretched fare out of their dinner basket, and washing it down
with draughts of the cold tea or the petrifying liquid they sometimes
brought with them in bottles.Sometimes, as has been said, the people of the house used to send up
some tea and bread and butter or cakes or other refreshments to the
workmen, but whenever Hunter got to know of it being done he used to
speak to the people about it and request that it be discontinued, as it
caused the men to waste their time.But the event of the year was the Beano, which took place on the last
Saturday in August, after they had been paying in for about four
months.The cost of the outing was to be five shillings a head, so
this was the amount each man had to pay in, but it was expected that
the total cost--the hire of the brakes and the cost of the
dinner--would come out at a trifle less than the amount stated, and in
that case the surplus would be shared out after the dinner.The amount
of the share-out would be greater or less according to other
circumstances, for it generally happened that apart from the
subscriptions of the men, the Beano fund was swelled by charitable
donations from several quarters, as will be seen later on.When the eventful day arrived, the hands, instead of working till one,
were paid at twelve o'clock and rushed off home to have a wash and
change.The brakes were to start from the 'Cricketers' at one, but it was
arranged, for the convenience of those who lived at Windley, that they
were to be picked up at the Cross Roads at one-thirty.There were four brakes altogether--three large ones for the men and one
small one for the accommodation of Mr Rushton and a few of his personal
friends, Didlum, Grinder, Mr Toonarf, an architect and Mr Lettum, a
house and estate Agent.One of the drivers was accompanied by a friend
who carried a long coachman's horn.This gentleman was not paid to
come, but, being out of work, he thought that the men would be sure to
stand him a few drinks and that they would probably make a collection
for him in return for his services.Most of the chaps were smoking twopenny cigars, and had one or two
drinks with each other to try to cheer themselves up before they
started, but all the same it was a melancholy procession that wended
its way up the hill to Windley.To judge from the mournful expression
on the long face of Misery, who sat on the box beside the driver of the
first large brake, and the downcast appearance of the majority of the
men, one might have thought that it was a funeral rather than a
pleasure party, or that they were a contingent of lost souls being
conducted to the banks of the Styx.The man who from time to time
sounded the coachman's horn might have passed as the angel sounding the
last trump, and the fumes of the cigars were typical of the smoke of
their torment, which ascendeth up for ever and ever.A brief halt was made at the Cross Roads to pick up several of the men,
including Philpot, Harlow, Easton, Ned Dawson, Sawkins, Bill Bates and
the Semi-drunk.The two last-named were now working for Smeariton and
Leavit, but as they had been paying in from the first, they had elected
to go to the Beano rather than have their money back.The Semi-drunk
and one or two other habitual boozers were very shabby and down at
heel, but the majority of the men were decently dressed.Some had taken
their Sunday clothes out of pawn especially for the occasion.Others
were arrayed in new suits which they were going to pay for at the rate
of a shilling a week.Some had bought themselves second-hand suits,
one or two were wearing their working clothes brushed and cleaned up,
and some were wearing Sunday clothes that had not been taken out of
pawn for the simple reason that the pawnbrokers would not take them in.These garments were in what might be called a transition
stage--old-fashioned and shiny with wear, but yet too good to take for
working in, even if their owners had been in a position to buy some
others to take their place for best.Crass, Slyme and one or two of
the single men, however, were howling swells, sporting stand-up collars
and bowler hats of the latest type, in contradistinction to some of the
others, who were wearing hats of antique patterns, and collars of
various shapes with jagged edges.Harlow had on an old straw hat that
his wife had cleaned up with oxalic acid, and Easton had carefully dyed
the faded binding of his black bowler with ink.Their boots were the
worst part of their attire: without counting Rushton and his friends,
there were thirty-seven men altogether, including Nimrod, and there
were not half a dozen pairs of really good boots amongst the whole
crowd.When all were seated a fresh start was made.The small brake, with
Rushton, Didlum, Grinder and two or three other members of the Band,
led the way.Next came the largest brake with Misery on the box.Beside the driver of the third brake was Payne, the foreman carpenter.Crass occupied a similar position of honour on the fourth brake, on the
back step of which was perched the man with the coachman's horn.Crass--who had engaged the brakes--had arranged with the drivers that
the cortege should pass through the street where he and Easton lived,
and as they went by Mrs Crass was standing at the door with the two
young men lodgers, who waved their handkerchiefs and shouted greetings.A little further on Mrs Linden and Easton's wife were standing at the
door to see them go by.In fact, the notes of the coachman's horn
alarmed most of the inhabitants, who crowded to their windows and doors
to gaze upon the dismal procession as it passed.The mean streets of Windley were soon left far behind and they found
themselves journeying along a sunlit, winding road, bordered with
hedges of hawthorn, holly and briar, past rich, brown fields of
standing corn, shimmering with gleams of gold, past apple-orchards
where bending boughs were heavily loaded with mellow fruits exhaling
fragrant odours, through the cool shades of lofty avenues of venerable
oaks, whose overarched and interlacing branches formed a roof of green,
gilt and illuminated with quivering spots and shafts of sunlight that
filtered through the trembling leaves; over old mossy stone bridges,
spanning limpid streams that duplicated the blue sky and the fleecy
clouds; and then again, stretching away to the horizon on every side
over more fields, some rich with harvest, others filled with drowsing
cattle or with flocks of timid sheep that scampered away at the sound
of the passing carriages.Several times they saw merry little
companies of rabbits frisking gaily in and out of the hedges or in the
fields beside the sheep and cattle.At intervals, away in the
distance, nestling in the hollows or amid sheltering trees, groups of
farm buildings and stacks of hay; and further on, the square ivy-clad
tower of an ancient church, or perhaps a solitary windmill with its
revolving sails alternately flashing and darkening in the rays of the
sun.Past thatched wayside cottages whose inhabitants came out to wave
their hands in friendly greeting.Past groups of sunburnt,
golden-haired children who climbed on fences and five-barred gates, and
waved their hats and cheered, or ran behind the brakes for the pennies
the men threw down to them.From time to time the men in the brakes made half-hearted attempts at
singing, but it never came to much, because most of them were too
hungry and miserable.They had not had time to take any dinner and
would not have taken any even if they had the time, for they wished to
reserve their appetites for the banquet at the Queen Elizabeth, which
they expected to reach about half past three.However, they cheered up
a little after the first halt--at the Blue Lion, where most of them got
down and had a drink.Some of them, including the Semi-drunk, Ned
Dawson, Bill Bates and Joe Philpot--had two or three drinks, and felt
so much happier for them that, shortly after they started off again,
sounds of melody were heard from the brake the three first named rode
in--the one presided over by Crass--but it was not very successful, and
even after the second halt--about five miles further on--at the
Warrior's Head, they found it impossible to sing with any heartiness.Fitful bursts of song arose from time to time from each of the brakes
in turn, only to die mournfully away.It is not easy to sing on an
empty stomach even if one has got a little beer in it; and so it was
with most of them.They were not in a mood to sing, or to properly
appreciate the scenes through which they were passing.They wanted
their dinners, and that was the reason why this long ride, instead of
being a pleasure, became after a while, a weary journey that seemed as
if it were never coming to an end.The next stop was at the Bird in Hand, a wayside public house that
stood all by itself in a lonely hollow.The landlord was a fat,
jolly-looking man, and there were several customers in the bar--men who
looked like farm-labourers, but there were no other houses to be seen
anywhere.This extraordinary circumstance exercised the minds of our
travellers and formed the principal topic of conversation until they
arrived at the Dew Drop Inn, about half an hour afterwards.The first
brake, containing Rushton and his friends, passed on without stopping
here.The occupants of the second brake, which was only a little way
behind the first, were divided in opinion whether to stop or go on.Some shouted out to the driver to pull up, others ordered him to
proceed, and more were undecided which course to pursue--a state of
mind that was not shared by the coachman, who, knowing that if they
stopped somebody or other would be sure to stand him a drink, had no
difficulty whatever in coming to a decision, but drew rein at the inn,
an example that was followed by both the other carriages as they drove
up.It was a very brief halt, not more than half the men getting down at
all, and those who remained in the brakes grumbled so much at the delay
that the others drank their beer as quickly as possible and the journey
was resumed once more, almost in silence.No attempts at singing, no
noisy laughter; they scarcely spoke to each other, but sat gloomily
gazing out over the surrounding country.Instructions had been given to the drivers not to stop again till they
reached the Queen Elizabeth, and they therefore drove past the World
Turned Upside Down without stopping, much to the chagrin of the
landlord of that house, who stood at the door with a sickly smile upon
his face.Some of those who knew him shouted out that they would give
him a call on their way back, and with this he had to be content.They reached the long-desired Queen Elizabeth at twenty minutes to
four, and were immediately ushered into a large room where a round
table and two long ones were set for dinner--and they were set in a
manner worthy of the reputation of the house.The cloths that covered the tables and the serviettes, arranged fanwise
in the drinking glasses, were literally as white as snow, and about a
dozen knives and forks and spoons were laid for each person.Down the
centre of the table glasses of delicious yellow custard and cut-glass
dishes of glistening red and golden jelly alternated with vases of
sweet-smelling flowers.The floor of the dining-room was covered with oilcloth--red flowers on
a pale yellow ground; the pattern was worn off in places, but it was
all very clean and shining.Whether one looked at the walls with the
old-fashioned varnished oak paper, or at the glossy piano standing
across the corner near the white-curtained window, at the shining oak
chairs or through the open casement doors that led into the shady
garden beyond, the dominating impression one received was that
everything was exquisitely clean.The landlord announced that dinner would be served in ten minutes, and
while they were waiting some of them indulged in a drink at the
bar--just as an appetizer--whilst the others strolled in the garden or,
by the landlord's invitation, looked over the house.Amongst other
places, they glanced into the kitchen, where the landlady was
superintending the preparation of the feast, and in this place, with
its whitewashed walls and red-tiled floor, as in every other part of
the house, the same absolute cleanliness reigned supreme.'It's a bit differint from the Royal Caff, where we got the sack, ain't
it?'remarked the Semi-drunk to Bill Bates as they made their way to
the dining-room in response to the announcement that dinner was ready.Rushton, with Didlum and Grinder and his other friends, sat at the
round table near the piano.Hunter took the head of the longer of the
other two tables and Crass the foot, and on either side of Crass were
Bundy and Slyme, who had acted with him as the Committee who had
arranged the Beano.Payne, the foreman carpenter, occupied the head of
the other table.The dinner was all that could be desired; it was almost as good as the
kind of dinner that is enjoyed every day by those persons who are too
lazy to work but are cunning enough to make others work for them.There was soup, several entrees, roast beef, boiled mutton, roast
turkey, roast goose, ham, cabbage, peas, beans and sweets galore, plum
pudding, custard, jelly, fruit tarts, bread and cheese and as much beer
or lemonade as they liked to pay for, the drinks being an extra; and
afterwards the waiters brought in cups of coffee for those who desired
it.Everything was up to the knocker, and although they were somewhat
bewildered by the multitude of knives and forks, they all, with one or
two exceptions, rose to the occasion and enjoyed themselves famously.The excellent decorum observed being marred only by one or two
regrettable incidents.The first of these occurred almost as soon as
they sat down, when Ned Dawson who, although a big strong fellow, was
not able to stand much beer, not being used to it, was taken ill and
had to be escorted from the room by his mate Bundy and another man.They left him somewhere outside and he came back again about ten
minutes afterwards, much better but looking rather pale, and took his
seat with the others.The turkeys, the roast beef and the boiled mutton, the peas and beans
and the cabbage, disappeared with astonishing rapidity, which was not
to be wondered at, for they were all very hungry from the long drive,
and nearly everyone made a point of having at least one helping of
everything there was to be had.Some of them went in for two lots of
soup.Then for the next course, boiled mutton and ham or turkey: then
some roast beef and goose.Then a little more boiled mutton with a
little roast beef.Each of the three boys devoured several times his
own weight of everything, to say nothing of numerous bottles of
lemonade and champagne ginger beer.Crass frequently paused to mop the perspiration from his face and neck
with his serviette.There was
enough and to spare of everything to eat, the beer was of the best, and
all the time, amid the rattle of the crockery and the knives and forks,
the proceedings were enlivened by many jests and flashes of wit that
continuously kept the table in a roar.'Chuck us over another dollop of that there white stuff, Bob,' shouted
the Semi-drunk to Crass, indicating the blancmange.Crass reached out his hand and took hold of the dish containing the
'white stuff', but instead of passing it to the Semi-drunk, he
proceeded to demolish it himself, gobbling it up quickly directly from
the dish with a spoon.'Why, you're eating it all yerself, yer bleeder,' cried the Semi-drunk
indignantly, as soon as he realized what was happening.'That's all right, matey,' replied Crass affably as he deposited the
empty dish on the table.'It don't matter, there's plenty more where
it come from.Upon being applied to, the landlord, who was assisted by his daughter,
two other young women and two young men, brought in several more lots
and so the Semi-drunk was appeased.As for the plum-pudding--it was a fair knock-out; just like Christmas:
but as Ned Dawson and Bill Bates had drunk all the sauce before the
pudding was served, they all had to have their first helping without
any.However, as the landlord brought in another lot shortly
afterwards, that didn't matter either.As soon as dinner was over, Crass rose to make his statement as
secretary.Thirty-seven men had paid five shillings each: that made
nine pounds five shillings.The committee had decided that the three
boys--the painters' boy, the carpenters' boy and the front shop
boy--should be allowed to come half-price: that made it nine pounds
twelve and six.In addition to paying the ordinary five-shilling
subscription, Mr Rushton had given one pound ten towards the expenses.And several other gentlemen had also given something
towards it.Mr Sweater, of the Cave, one pound.Mr
Grinder, ten shillings in addition to the five-shilling subscription.Mr Lettum, ten shillings, as well as the five-shilling
subscription.Mr Didlum, ten shillings in addition to the
five shillings.Mr Toonarf, ten shillings as well as the
five-shilling subscription.They had also written to some of the
manufacturers who supplied the firm with materials, and asked them to
give something: some of 'em had sent half a crown, some five shillings,
some hadn't answered at all, and two of 'em had written back to say
that as things is cut so fine nowadays, they didn't hardly get no
profit on their stuff, so they couldn't afford to give nothing; but out
of all the firms they wrote to they managed to get thirty-two and
sixpence altogether, making a grand total of seventeen pounds.As for the expenses, the dinner was two and six a head, and there was
forty-five of them there, so that came to five pounds twelve and six.Then there was the hire of the brakes, also two and six a head, five
pound twelve and six, which left a surplus of five pound fifteen to be
shared out (applause), which came to three shillings each for the
thirty-seven men, and one and fourpence for each of the boys.Crass, Slyme and Bundy now walked round the tables distributing the
share-out, which was very welcome to everybody, especially those who
had spent nearly all their money during the journey from Mugsborough,
and when this ceremony was completed, Philpot moved a hearty vote of
thanks to the committee for the manner in which they had carried out
their duties, which was agreed to with acclamation.Then they made a
collection for the waiters, and the three waitresses, which amounted to
eleven shillings, for which the host returned thanks on behalf of the
recipients, who were all smiles.Then Mr Rushton requested the landlord to serve drinks and cigars all
round.Some had cigarettes and the teetotallers had lemonade or ginger
beer.Those who did not smoke themselves took the cigar all the same
and gave it to someone else who did.When all were supplied there
suddenly arose loud cries of 'Order!'and it was seen that Hunter was
upon his feet.As soon as silence was obtained, Misery said that he believed that
everyone there present would agree with him, when he said that they
should not let the occasion pass without drinking the 'ealth of their
esteemed and respected employer, Mr Rushton.Some of
them had worked for Mr Rushton on and off for many years, and as far as
THEY was concerned it was not necessary for him (Hunter) to say much in
praise of Mr Rushton.They knew Mr Rushton as well as
he did himself and to know him was to esteem him.As for the
new hands, although they did not know Mr Rushton as well as the old
hands did, he felt sure that they would agree that as no one could wish
for a better master.He had much pleasure in asking
them to drink Mr Rushton's health.'Musical honours, chaps,' shouted Crass, waving his glass and leading
off the singing which was immediately joined in with great enthusiasm
by most of the men, the Semi-drunk conducting the music with a table
knife:

        For he's a jolly good fellow,
        For he's a jolly good fellow,
        For he's a jolly good fel-ell-O,
        And so say all of us,
        So 'ip, 'ip, 'ip, 'ooray!So 'ip, 'ip, 'ip, 'ooray!For he's a jolly good fellow,
        For 'e's a jolly good fellow
        For 'e's a jolly good fel-ell-O,
        And so say all of us.Hip, hip, hip, hooray!Hip, hip, hip, hooray!Hip, hip, hip, hooray!Everyone present drank Rushton's health, or at any rate went through
the motions of doing so, but during the roar of cheering and singing
that preceded it several of the men stood with expressions of contempt
or uneasiness upon their faces, silently watching the enthusiasts or
looking at the ceiling or on the floor.'I will say this much,' remarked the Semidrunk as they all resumed
their seats--he had had several drinks during dinner, besides those he
had taken on the journey--I will say this much, although I did have a
little misunderstanding with Mr Hunter when I was workin' at the Royal
Caff, I must admit that this is the best firm that's ever worked under
me.'This statement caused a shout of laughter, which, however, died away as
Mr Rushton rose to acknowledge the toast to his health.He said that
he had now been in business for nearly sixteen years and this was--he
believed--the eleventh outing he had had the pleasure of attending.During all that time the business had steadily progressed and had
increased in volume from year to year, and he hoped and believed that
the progress made in the past would be continued in the future.Of course, he realized that the success of the business
depended very largely upon the men as well as upon himself; he did his
best in trying to get work for them, and it was necessary--if the
business was to go on and prosper--that they should also do their best
to get the work done when he had secured it for them.The masters could not do without the men, and the men could not live
without the masters.It was a matter of division of
labour: the men worked with their hands and the masters worked with
their brains, and one was no use without the other.He hoped the good
feeling which had hitherto existed between himself and his workmen
would always continue, and he thanked them for the way in which they
had responded to the toast of his health.Loud cheers greeted the conclusion of this speech, and then Crass stood
up and said that he begged to propose the health of Mr 'Unter.He wasn't going to make a long speech as he wasn't much of a
speaker.(Cries of 'You're all right,' 'Go on,' etc.)But he felt
sure as they would all hagree with him when he said that--next to Mr
Rushton--there wasn't no one the men had more respect and liking for
than Mr 'Unter.A few weeks ago when Mr 'Unter was laid up,
many of them began to be afraid as they was going to lose 'im.He was
sure that all the 'ands was glad to 'ave this hoppertunity of
congratulating him on his recovery (Hear, hear) and of wishing him the
best of 'ealth in the future and hoping as he would be spared to come
to a good many more Beanos.Loud applause greeted the conclusion of Crass's remarks, and once more
the meeting burst into song:

        For he's a jolly good fellow
        For he's a jolly good fellow.For he's a jolly good fellow,
        And so say all of us.So 'ip, 'ip, 'ip, 'ooray!So 'ip, 'ip, 'ip, 'ooray!When they had done cheering, Nimrod rose.His voice trembled a little
as he thanked them for their kindness, and said that he hoped he
deserved their goodwill.He could only say that as he was sure as he
always tried to be fair and considerate to everyone.He
would now request the landlord to replenish their glasses.As soon as the drinks were served, Nimrod again rose and said he wished
to propose the healths of their visitors who had so kindly contributed
to their expenses--Mr Lettum, Mr Didlum, Mr Toonarf and Mr Grinder.They were very pleased and proud to see them there (Hear,
hear), and he was sure the men would agree with him when he said that
Messrs Lettum, Didlum, Toonarf and Grinder were jolly good fellows.To judge from the manner in which they sang the chorus and cheered, it
was quite evident that most of the hands did agree.When they left
off, Grinder rose to reply on behalf of those included in the toast.He
said that it gave them much pleasure to be there and take part in such
pleasant proceedings and they were glad to think that they had been
able to help to bring it about.It was very gratifying to see the good
feeling that existed between Mr Rushton and his workmen, which was as
it should be, because masters and men was really fellow workers--the
masters did the brain work, the men the 'and work.They was both
workers, and their interests was the same.He liked to see men doing
their best for their master and knowing that their master was doing his
best for them, that he was not only a master, but a friend.That was
what he (Grinder) liked to see--master and men pulling together--doing
their best, and realizing that their interests was identical.If only all masters and men would do this they would find
that everything would go on all right, there would be more work and
less poverty.Let the men do their best for their masters, and the
masters do their best for their men, and they would find that that was
the true solution of the social problem, and not the silly nonsense
that was talked by people what went about with red flags.Most of those fellows were chaps who was too lazy to work
for their livin'.They could take it from him that, if
ever the Socialists got the upper hand there would just be a few of the
hartful dodgers who would get all the cream, and there would be nothing
left but 'ard work for the rest.That's wot hall those
hagitators was after: they wanted them (his hearers) to work and keep
'em in idleness.On behalf of Mr Didlum, Mr Toonarf, Mr
Lettum and himself, he thanked them for their good wishes, and hoped to
be with them on a sim'ler occasion in the future.Loud cheers greeted the termination of his speech, but it was obvious
from some of the men's faces that they resented Grinder's remarks.These men ridiculed Socialism and regularly voted for the continuance
of capitalism, and yet they were disgusted and angry with Grinder!There was also a small number of Socialists--not more than half a dozen
altogether--who did not join in the applause.These men were all
sitting at the end of the long table presided over by Payne.None of
them had joined in the applause that greeted the speeches, and so far
neither had they made any protest.Some of them turned very red as
they listened to the concluding sentences of Grinder's oration, and
others laughed, but none of them said anything.They knew before they
came that there was sure to be a lot of 'Jolly good fellow' business
and speechmaking, and they had agreed together beforehand to take no
part one way or the other, and to refrain from openly dissenting from
anything that might be said, but they had not anticipated anything
quite so strong as this.When Grinder sat down some of those who had applauded him began to jeer
at the Socialists.'What have you got to say to that?''They ain't got nothing to say now.''Why don't some of you get up and make a speech?'This last appeared to be a very good idea to those Liberals and Tories
who had not liked Grinder's observations, so they all began to shout
'Owen!'Several of those who had been loudest in applauding Grinder
also joined in the demand that Owen should make a speech, because they
were certain that Grinder and the other gentlemen would be able to
dispose of all his arguments; but Owen and the other Socialists made no
response except to laugh, so presently Crass tied a white handkerchief
on a cane walking-stick that belonged to Mr Didlum, and stuck it in the
vase of flowers that stood on the end of the table where the Socialist
group were sitting.When the noise had in some measure ceased, Grinder again rose.'When I
made the few remarks that I did, I didn't know as there was any
Socialists 'ere: I could tell from the look of you that most of you had
more sense.At the same time I'm rather glad I said what I did,
because it just shows you what sort of chaps these Socialists are.They're pretty artful--they know when to talk and when to keep their
mouths shut.What they like is to get hold of a few ignorant workin'
men in a workshop or a public house, and then they can talk by the
mile--reg'ler shop lawyers, you know wot I mean--I'm right and
everybody else is wrong.You know the sort of thing I
mean.When they finds theirselves in the company of edicated people
wot knows a little more than they does theirselves, and who isn't
likely to be misled by a lot of claptrap, why then, mum's the word.So
next time you hears any of these shop lawyers' arguments, you'll know
how much it's worth.'Most of the men were delighted with this speech, which was received
with much laughing and knocking on the tables.They remarked to each
other that Grinder was a smart man: he'd got the Socialists weighed up
just about right--to an ounce.Then, it was seen that Barrington was on his feet facing Grinder and a
sudden, awe-filled silence fell.'It may or may not be true,' began Barrington, 'that Socialists always
know when to speak and when to keep silent, but the present occasion
hardly seemed a suitable one to discuss such subjects.'We are here today as friends and want to forget our differences and
enjoy ourselves for a few hours.But after what Mr Grinder has said I
am quite ready to reply to him to the best of my ability.'The fact that I am a Socialist and that I am here today as one of Mr
Rushton's employees should be an answer to the charge that Socialists
are too lazy to work for their living.And as to taking advantage of
the ignorance and simplicity of working men and trying to mislead them
with nonsensical claptrap, it would have been more to the point if Mr
Grinder had taken some particular Socialist doctrine and had proved it
to be untrue or misleading, instead of adopting the cowardly method of
making vague general charges that he cannot substantiate.He would
find it far more difficult to do that than it would be for a Socialist
to show that most of what Mr Grinder himself has been telling us is
nonsensical claptrap of the most misleading kind.He tells us that the
employers work with their brains and the men with their hands.If it
is true that no brains are required to do manual labour, why put idiots
into imbecile asylums?Why not let them do some of the hand work for
which no brains are required?As they are idiots, they would probably
be willing to work for even less than the ideal "living wage".If Mr
Grinder had ever tried, he would know that manual workers have to
concentrate their minds and their attention on their work or they would
not be able to do it at all.His talk about employers being not only
the masters but the "friends" of their workmen is also mere claptrap
because he knows as well as we do, that no matter how good or
benevolent an employer may be, no matter how much he might desire to
give his men good conditions, it is impossible for him to do so,
because he has to compete against other employers who do not do that.It is the bad employer--the sweating, slave-driving employer--who sets
the pace and the others have to adopt the same methods--very often
against their inclinations--or they would not be able to compete with
him.If any employer today were to resolve to pay his workmen not less
wages than he would be able to live upon in comfort himself, that he
would not require them to do more work in a day than he himself would
like to perform every day of his own life, Mr Grinder knows as well as
we do that such an employer would be bankrupt in a month; because he
would not be able to get any work except by taking it at the same price
as the sweaters and the slave-drivers.'He also tells us that the interests of masters and men are identical;
but if an employer has a contract, it is to his interest to get the
work done as soon as possible; the sooner it is done the more profit he
will make; but the more quickly it is done, the sooner will the men be
out of employment.How then can it be true that their interests are
identical?'Again, let us suppose that an employer is, say, thirty years of age
when he commences business, and that he carries it on for twenty years.Let us assume that he employs forty men more or less regularly during
that period and that the average age of these men is also thirty years
at the time the employer commences business.At the end of the twenty
years it usually happens that the employer has made enough money to
enable him to live for the remainder of his life in ease and comfort.All through those twenty years they have
earned but a bare living wage and have had to endure such privations
that those who are not already dead are broken in health.'In the case of the employer there had been twenty years of steady
progress towards ease and leisure and independence.In the case of the
majority of the men there were twenty years of deterioration, twenty
years of steady, continuous and hopeless progress towards physical and
mental inefficiency: towards the scrap-heap, the work-house, and
premature death.What is it but false, misleading, nonsensical
claptrap to say that their interests were identical with those of their
employer?'Such talk as that is not likely to deceive any but children or fools.We are not children, but it is very evident that Mr Grinder thinks that
we are fools.'Occasionally it happens, through one or more of a hundred different
circumstances over which he has no control, or through some error of
judgement, that after many years of laborious mental work an employer
is overtaken by misfortune, and finds himself no better and even worse
off than when he started; but these are exceptional cases, and even if
he becomes absolutely bankrupt he is no worse off than the majority of
the workmen.'At the same time it is quite true that the real interests of employers
and workmen are the same, but not in the sense that Mr Grinder would
have us believe.Under the existing system of society but a very few
people, no matter how well off they may be, can be certain that they or
their children will not eventually come to want; and even those who
think they are secure themselves, find their happiness diminished by
the knowledge of the poverty and misery that surrounds them on every
side.'In that sense only is it true that the interests of masters and men
are identical, for it is to the interest of all, both rich and poor, to
help to destroy a system that inflicts suffering upon the many and
allows true happiness to none.It is to the interest of all to try and
find a better way.'Here Crass jumped up and interrupted, shouting out that they hadn't
come there to listen to a lot of speechmaking--a remark that was
greeted with unbounded applause by most of those present.Loud cries
of 'Hear, hear!'resounded through the room, and the Semi-drunk
suggested that someone should sing a song.The men who had clamoured for a speech from Owen said nothing, and Mr
Grinder, who had been feeling rather uncomfortable, was secretly very
glad of the interruption.The Semi-drunk's suggestion that someone should sing a song was
received with unqualified approbation by everybody, including
Barrington and the other Socialists, who desired nothing better than
that the time should be passed in a manner suitable to the occasion.The landlord's daughter, a rosy girl of about twenty years of age, in a
pink print dress, sat down at the piano, and the Semi-drunk, taking his
place at the side of the instrument and facing the audience, sang the
first song with appropriate gestures, the chorus being rendered
enthusiastically by the full strength of the company, including Misery,
who by this time was slightly drunk from drinking gin and ginger beer:

        'Come, come, come an' 'ave a drink with me
        Down by the ole Bull and Bush.Come, come, come an' shake 'ands with me
        Down by the ole Bull and Bush.Come an' take 'old of me 'and
        Come, come, come an' 'ave a drink with me,
        Down by the old Bull and Bush,
        Bush!Protracted knocking on the tables greeted the end of the song, but as
the Semi-drunk knew no other except odd verses and choruses, he called
upon Crass for the next, and that gentleman accordingly sang 'Work,
Boys, Work' to the tune of 'Tramp, tramp, tramp, the boys are
marching'.As this song is the Marseillaise of the Tariff Reform
Party, voicing as it does the highest ideals of the Tory workmen of
this country, it was an unqualified success, for most of them were
Conservatives.'Now I'm not a wealthy man,
        But I lives upon a plan
        Wot will render me as 'appy as a King;
        An' if you will allow, I'll sing it to you now,
        For time you know is always on the wing.Work, boys, work and be contented
        So long as you've enough to buy a meal.For if you will but try, you'll be wealthy--bye and bye--
        If you'll only put yer shoulder to the wheel.''Altogether, boys,' shouted Grinder, who was a strong Tariff Reformer,
and was delighted to see that most of the men were of the same way of
thinking; and the 'boys' roared out the chorus once more:

        Work, boys, work and be contented
        So long as you've enough to buy a meal
        For if you will but try, you'll be wealthy--bye and bye
        If you'll only put your shoulder to the wheel.As they sang the words of this noble chorus the Tories seemed to become
inspired with lofty enthusiasm.It is of course impossible to say for
certain, but probably as they sang there arose before their exalted
imaginations, a vision of the Past, and looking down the long vista of
the years that were gone, they saw that from their childhood they had
been years of poverty and joyless toil.They saw their fathers and
mothers, weaned and broken with privation and excessive labour, sinking
unhonoured into the welcome oblivion of the grave.And then, as a change came over the spirit of their dream, they saw the
Future, with their own children travelling along the same weary road to
the same kind of goal.It is possible that visions of this character were conjured up in their
minds by the singing, for the words of the song gave expression to
their ideal of what human life should be.That was all they wanted--to
be allowed to work like brutes for the benefit of other people.They
did not want to be civilized themselves and they intended to take good
care that the children they had brought into the world should never
enjoy the benefits of civilization either.As they often said:

'Who and what are our children that they shouldn't be made to work for
their betters?They're not Gentry's children, are they?The good
things of life was never meant for the likes of them.That's wot the likes of them was made for, and if we can only get
Tariff Reform for 'em they will always be sure of plenty of it--not
only Full Time, but Overtime!As for edication, travellin' in furrin'
parts, an' enjoying life an' all sich things as that, they was never
meant for the likes of our children--they're meant for Gentry's
children!Our children is only like so much dirt compared with
Gentry's children!That's wot the likes of us is made for--to Work for
Gentry, so as they can 'ave plenty of time to enjoy theirselves; and
the Gentry is made to 'ave a good time so as the likes of us can 'ave
Plenty of Work.'There were several more verses, and by the time they had sung them all,
the Tories were in a state of wild enthusiasm.Even Ned Dawson, who
had fallen asleep with his head pillowed on his arms on the table,
roused himself up at the end of each verse, and after having joined in
the chorus, went to sleep again.At the end of the song they gave three cheers for Tariff Reform and
Plenty of Work, and then Crass, who, as the singer of the last song,
had the right to call upon the next man, nominated Philpot, who
received an ovation when he stood up, for he was a general favourite.He never did no harm to nobody, and he was always wiling to do anyone a
good turn whenever he had the opportunity.Shouts of 'Good old Joe'
resounded through the room as he crossed over to the piano, and in
response to numerous requests for 'The old song' he began to sing 'The
Flower Show':

        'Whilst walkin' out the other night, not knowing where to go
        I saw a bill upon a wall about a Flower Show.So I thought the flowers I'd go and see to pass away the night.And when I got into that Show it was a curious sight.So with your kind intention and a little of your aid,
        Tonight some flowers I'll mention which I hope will never fade.'Omnes:
        To-night some flowers I'll mention which I hope will never fade.'There were several more verses, from which it appeared that the
principal flowers in the Show were the Rose, the Thistle and the
Shamrock.When he had finished, the applause was so deafening and the demands for
an encore so persistent that to satisfy them he sang another old
favourite--'Won't you buy my pretty flowers?''Ever coming, ever going,
        Men and women hurry by,
        Heedless of the tear-drops gleaming,
        In her sad and wistful eye
        How her little heart is sighing
        Thro' the cold and dreary hours,
        Only listen to her crying,
        "Won't you buy my pretty flowers?"'When the last verse of this sang had been sung five er six times,
Philpot exercised his right of nominating the next singer, and called
upon Dick Wantley, who with many suggestive gestures and grimaces sang
'Put me amongst the girls', and afterwards called upon Payne, the
foreman carpenter, who gave 'I'm the Marquis of Camberwell Green'.There was a lot of what music-hall artists call 'business' attached to
his song, and as he proceeded, Payne, who was ghastly pale and very
nervous, went through a lot of galvanic motions and gestures, bowing
and scraping and sliding about and flourishing his handkerchief in
imitation of the courtly graces of the Marquis.During this
performance the audience maintained an appalling silence, which so
embarrassed Payne that before he was half-way through the song he had
to stop because he could not remember the rest.However, to make up
for this failure he sang another called 'We all must die, like the fire
in the grate'.This also was received in a very lukewarm manner by the
crowd, same of whom laughed and others suggested that if he couldn't
sing any better than that, the sooner HE was dead the better.This was followed by another Tory ballad, the chorus being as follows:

        His clothes may be ragged, his hands may be soiled.But where's the disgrace if for bread he has toiled.His 'art is in the right place, deny it no one can
        The backbone of Old England is the honest workin' man.'After a few more songs it was decided to adjourn to a field at the rear
of the tavern to have a game of cricket.Sides were formed, Rushton,
Didlum, Grinder, and the other gentlemen taking part just as if they
were only common people, and while the game was in progress the rest
played ring quoits or reclined on the grass watching the players,
whilst the remainder amused themselves drinking beer and playing cards
and shove-ha'penny in the bar parlour, or taking walks around the
village sampling the beer at the other pubs, of which there were three.The time passed in this manner until seven o'clock, the hour at which
it had been arranged to start on the return journey; but about a
quarter of an hour before they set out an unpleasant incident occurred.During the time that they were playing cricket a party of glee singers,
consisting of four young girls and five men, three of whom were young
fellows, the other two being rather elderly, possibly the fathers of
some of the younger members of the party, came into the field and sang
several part songs for their entertainment.Towards the close of the
game most of the men had assembled in this field, and during a pause in
the singing the musicians sent one of their number, a shy girl about
eighteen years of age--who seemed as if she would rather that someone
else had the task--amongst the crowd to make a collection.The girl
was very nervous and blushed as she murmured her request, and held out
a straw hat that evidently belonged to one of the male members of the
glee party.A few of the men gave pennies, some refused or pretended
not to see either the girl or the hat, others offered to give her some
money for a kiss, but what caused the trouble was that two or three of
those who had been drinking more than was good for them dropped the
still burning ends of their cigars, all wet with saliva as they were,
into the hat and Dick Wantley spit into it.The girl hastily returned to her companions, and as she went some of
the men who had witnessed the behaviour of those who had insulted her,
advised them to make themselves scarce, as they stood a good chance of
getting a thrashing from the girl's friends.They said it would serve
them dam' well right if they did get a hammering.Partly sobered by fear, the three culprits sneaked off and hid
themselves, pale and trembling with terror, under the box seats of the
three brakes.They had scarcely left when the men of the glee party
came running up, furiously demanding to see those who had insulted the
girl.As they could get no satisfactory answer, one of their number
ran back and presently returned, bringing the girl with him, the other
young women following a little way behind.She said she could not see the men they were looking for, so they went
down to the public house to see if they could find them there, some of
the Rushton's men accompanying them and protesting their indignation.The time passed quickly enough and by half past seven the brakes were
loaded up again and a start made for the return journey.They called at all the taverns on the road, and by the time they
reached the Blue Lion half of them were three sheets in the wind, and
five or six were very drunk, including the driver of Crass's brake and
the man with the bugle.The latter was so far gone that they had to
let him lie down in the bottom of the carriage amongst their feet,
where he fell asleep, while the others amused themselves by blowing
weird shrieks out of the horn.There was an automatic penny-in-the-slot piano at the Blue Lion and as
that was the last house of the road they made a rather long stop there,
playing hooks and rings, shove-ha'penny, drinking, singing, dancing and
finally quarrelling.Several of them seemed disposed to quarrel with Newman.All sorts of
offensive remarks were made at him in his hearing.Once someone
ostentatiously knocked his glass of lemonade over, and a little later
someone else collided violently with him just as he was in the act of
drinking, causing his lemonade to spill all over his clothes.The
worst of it was that most of these rowdy ones were his fellow
passengers in Crass's brake, and there was not much chance of getting a
seat in either of the other carriages, for they were overcrowded
already.From the remarks he overheard from time to time, Newman guessed the
reason of their hostility, and as their manner towards him grew more
menacing, he became so nervous that he began to think of quietly
sneaking off and walking the remainder of the way home by himself,
unless he could get somebody in one of the other brakes to change seats
with him.Whilst these thoughts were agitating his mind, Dick Wantley suddenly
shouted out that he was going to go for the dirty tyke who had offered
to work under price last winter.It was his fault that they were all working for sixpence halfpenny and
he was going to wipe the floor with him.Some of his friends eagerly
offered to assist, but others interposed, and for a time it looked as
if there was going to be a free fight, the aggressors struggling hard
to get at their inoffensive victim.Eventually, however, Newman found a seat in Misery's brake, squatting
on the floor with his back to the horses, thankful enough to be out of
reach of the drunken savages, who were now roaring out ribald songs and
startling the countryside, as they drove along, with unearthly blasts
on the coach horn.Meantime, although none of them seemed to notice it, the brake was
travelling at a furious rate, and swaying about from side to side in a
very erratic manner.It would have been the last carriage, but things
had got a bit mixed at the Blue Lion and, instead of bringing up the
rear of the procession, it was now second, just behind the small
vehicle containing Rushton and his friends.Crass several times reminded them that the other carriage was so near
that Rushton must be able to hear every word that was said, and these
repeated admonitions at length enraged the Semi-drunk, who shouted out
that they didn't care a b--r if he could hear.'You're only a dirty toe-rag!That's all you are--a bloody rotter!That's the only reason you gets put in charge of jobs--'cos you're a
good <DW65>-driver!You're a bloody sight worse than Rushton or Misery
either!Who was it started the one-man, one-room dodge, eh?'Knock 'im orf 'is bleedin' perch,' suggested Bundy.Everybody seemed to think this was a very good idea, but when the
Semi-drunk attempted to rise for the purpose of carrying it out, he was
thrown down by a sudden lurch of the carriage on the top of the
prostrate figure of the bugle man and by the time the others had
assisted him back to his seat they had forgotten all about their plan
of getting rid of Crass.Meantime the speed of the vehicle had increased to a fearful rate.Rushton and the other occupants of the little wagonette in front had
been for some time shouting to them to moderate the pace of their
horses, but as the driver of Crass's brake was too drunk to understand
what they said he took no notice, and they had no alternative but to
increase their own speed to avoid being run down.The drunken driver
now began to imagine that they were trying to race him, and became
fired with the determination to pass them.It was a very narrow road,
but there was just about room to do it, and he had sufficient
confidence in his own skill with the ribbons to believe that he could
get past in safety.The terrified gesticulations and the shouts of Rushton's party only
served to infuriate him, because he imagined that they were jeering at
him for not being able to overtake them.He stood up on the footboard
and lashed the horses till they almost flew over the ground, while the
carriage swayed and skidded in a fearful manner.In front, the horses of Rushton's conveyance were also galloping at top
speed, the vehicle bounding and reeling from one side of the road to
the other, whilst its terrified occupants, whose faces were blanched
with apprehension, sat clinging to their seats and to each other, their
eyes projecting from the sockets as they gazed back with terror at
their pursuers, some of whom were encouraging the drunken driver with
promises of quarts of beer, and urging on the horses with curses and
yells.Crass's fat face was pallid with fear as he clung trembling to his
seat.Another man, very drunk and oblivious of everything, was leaning
over the side of the brake, spewing into the road, while the remainder,
taking no interest in the race, amused themselves by singing--conducted
by the Semi-drunk--as loud as they could roar:

        'Has anyone seen a Germin band,
        Germin Band, Germin Band?I've been lookin' about,
        Pom--Pom, Pom, Pom, Pom!'I've searched every pub, both near and far,
        Near and far, near and far,
        I want my Fritz,
        What plays tiddley bits
        On the big trombone!'The one presided over by
Hunter contained a mournful crew.Nimrod himself, from the effects of
numerous drinks of ginger beer with secret dashes of gin in it, had
become at length crying drunk, and sat weeping in gloomy silence beside
the driver, a picture of lachrymose misery and but dimly conscious of
his surroundings, and Slyme, who rode with Hunter because he was a
fellow member of the Shining Light Chapel.Then there was another
paperhanger--an unhappy wretch who was afflicted with religious mania;
he had brought a lot of tracts with him which he had distributed to the
other men, to the villagers of Tubberton and to anybody else who would
take them.Most of the other men who rode in Nimrod's brake were of the
'religious' working man type.Ignorant, shallow-pated dolts, without
as much intellectuality as an average cat.Attendants at various PSAs
and 'Church Mission Halls' who went every Sunday afternoon to be
lectured on their duty to their betters and to have their minds--save
the mark!--addled and stultified by such persons as Rushton, Sweater,
Didlum and Grinder, not to mention such mental specialists as the holy
reverend Belchers and Boshers, and such persons as John Starr.At these meetings none of the'respectable' working men were allowed to
ask any questions, or to object to, or find fault with anything that
was said, or to argue, or discuss, or criticize.They had to sit there
like a lot of children while they were lectured and preached at and
patronized.Even as sheep before their shearers are dumb, so they were
not permitted to open their mouths.For that matter they did not wish
to be allowed to ask any questions, or to discuss anything.They sat there and listened to what was said,
but they had but a very hazy conception of what it was all about.Most of them belonged to these PSAs merely for the sake of the loaves
and fishes.Every now and then they were awarded prizes--Self-help by
Smiles, and other books suitable for perusal by persons suffering from
almost complete obliteration of the mental faculties.Besides other
benefits there was usually a Christmas Club attached to the 'PSA' or
'Mission' and the things were sold to the members slightly below cost
as a reward for their servility.They were for the most part tame, broken-spirited, poor wretches who
contentedly resigned themselves to a life of miserable toil and
poverty, and with callous indifference abandoned their offspring to the
same fate.Compared with such as these, the savages of New Guinea or
the Red Indians are immensely higher in the scale of manhood.They call no man master; and if they do not enjoy the benefits
of science and civilization, neither do they toil to create those
things for the benefit of others.And as for their children--most of
those savages would rather knock them on the head with a tomahawk than
allow them to grow up to be half-starved drudges for other men.But these were not free: their servile lives were spent in grovelling
and cringing and toiling and running about like little dogs at the
behest of their numerous masters.And as for the benefits of science
and civilization, their only share was to work and help to make them,
and then to watch other men enjoy them.And all the time they were
tame and quiet and content and said, 'The likes of us can't expect to
'ave nothing better, and as for our children wot's been good enough for
us is good enough for the likes of them.'But although they were so religious and respectable and so contented to
be robbed on a large scale, yet in small matters, in the commonplace
and petty affairs of their everyday existence, most of these men were
acutely alive to what their enfeebled minds conceived to be their own
selfish interests, and they possessed a large share of that singular
cunning which characterizes this form of dementia.That was why they had chosen to ride in Nimrod's brake--because they
wished to chum up with him as much as possible, in order to increase
their chances of being kept on in preference to others who were not so
respectable.Some of these poor creatures had very large heads, but a close
examination would have shown that the size was due to the extraordinary
thickness of the bones.The cavity of the skull was not so large as
the outward appearance of the head would have led a casual observer to
suppose, and even in those instances where the brain was of a fair
size, it was of inferior quality, being coarse in texture and to a
great extent composed of fat.Although most of them were regular attendants at some place of
so-called worship, they were not all teetotallers, and some of them
were now in different stages of intoxication, not because they had had
a great deal to drink, but because--being usually abstemious--it did
not take very much to make them drunk.From time to time this miserable crew tried to enliven the journey by
singing, but as most of them only knew odd choruses it did not come to
much.As for the few who did happen to know all the words of a song,
they either had no voices or were not inclined to sing.The most
successful contribution was that of the religious maniac, who sang
several hymns, the choruses being joined in by everybody, both drunk
and sober.The strains of these hymns, wafted back through the balmy air to the
last coach, were the cause of much hilarity to its occupants who also
sang the choruses.As they had all been brought up under 'Christian'
influences and educated in 'Christian' schools, they all knew the
words: 'Work, for the night is coming', 'Turn poor Sinner and escape
Eternal Fire', 'Pull for the Shore' and 'Where is my Wandering Boy?'The last reminded Harlow of a song he knew nearly all the words of,
'Take the news to Mother', the singing of which was much appreciated by
all present and when it was finished they sang it all over again,
Philpot being so affected that he actually shed tears; and Easton
confided to Owen that there was no getting away from the fact that a
boy's best friend is his mother.In this last carriage, as in the other two, there were several men who
were more or less intoxicated and for the same reason--because not
being used to taking much liquor, the few extra glasses they had drunk
had got into their heads.They were as sober a lot of fellows as need
be at ordinary times, and they had flocked together in this brake
because they were all of about the same character--not tame, contented
imbeciles like most of those in Misery's carnage, but men something
like Harlow, who, although dissatisfied with their condition, doggedly
continued the hopeless, weary struggle against their fate.They were not teetotallers and they never went to either church or
chapel, but they spent little in drink or on any form of enjoyment--an
occasional glass of beer or a still rarer visit to a music-hall and now
and then an outing more or less similar to this being the sum total of
their pleasures.These four brakes might fitly be regarded as so many travelling lunatic
asylums, the inmates of each exhibiting different degrees and forms of
mental disorder.The occupants of the first--Rushton, Didlum and Co.--might be classed
as criminal lunatics who injured others as well as themselves.In a
properly constituted system of society such men as these would be
regarded as a danger to the community, and would be placed under such
restraint as would effectually prevent them from harming themselves or
others.These wretches had abandoned every thought and thing that
tends to the elevation of humanity.They had given up everything that
makes life good and beautiful, in order to carry on a mad struggle to
acquire money which they would never be sufficiently cultured to
properly enjoy.Deaf and blind to every other consideration, to this
end they had degraded their intellects by concentrating them upon the
minutest details of expense and profit, and for their reward they raked
in their harvest of muck and lucre along with the hatred and curses of
those they injured in the process.They knew that the money they
accumulated was foul with the sweat of their brother men, and wet with
the tears of little children, but they were deaf and blind and callous
to the consequences of their greed.Devoid of every ennobling thought
or aspiration, they grovelled on the filthy ground, tearing up the
flowers to get at the worms.In the coach presided over by Crass, Bill Bates, the Semi-drunk and the
other two or three habitual boozers were all men who had been driven
mad by their environment.At one time most of them had been fellows
like Harlow, working early and late whenever they got the chance, only
to see their earnings swallowed up in a few minutes every Saturday by
the landlord and all the other host of harpies and profitmongers, who
were waiting to demand it as soon as it was earned.In the years that
were gone, most of these men used to take all their money home
religiously every Saturday and give it to the 'old girl' for the house,
and then, lo and behold, in a moment, yea, even in the twinkling of an
eye, it was all gone!and nothing to
show for it except an insufficiency of the bare necessaries of life!But after a time they had become heartbroken and sick and tired of that
sort of thing.They hankered after a little pleasure, a little
excitement, a little fun, and they found that it was possible to buy
something like those in quart pots at the pub.They knew they were not
the genuine articles, but they were better than nothing at all, and so
they gave up the practice of giving all their money to the old girl to
give to the landlord and the other harpies, and bought beer with some
of it instead; and after a time their minds became so disordered from
drinking so much of this beer, that they cared nothing whether the rent
was paid or not.They cared but little whether the old girl and the
children had food or clothes.They said, 'To hell with everything and
everyone,' and they cared for nothing so long as they could get plenty
of beer.The occupants of Nimrod's coach have already been described and most of
them may correctly be classed as being similar to <DW35> idiots of the
third degree--very cunning and selfish, and able to read and write, but
with very little understanding of what they read except on the most
common topics.As for those who rode with Harlow in the last coach, most of them, as
has been already intimated, were men of similar character to himself.The greater number of them fairly good workmen and--unlike the boozers
in Crass's coach--not yet quite heartbroken, but still continuing the
hopeless struggle against poverty.These differed from Nimrod's lot
inasmuch as they were not content.They were always complaining of
their wretched circumstances, and found a certain kind of pleasure in
listening to the tirades of the Socialists against the existing social
conditions, and professing their concurrence with many of the
sentiments expressed, and a desire to bring about a better state of
affairs.Most of them appeared to be quite sane, being able to converse
intelligently on any ordinary subject without discovering any symptoms
of mental disorder, and it was not until the topic of Parliamentary
elections was mentioned that evidence of their insanity was
forthcoming.It then almost invariably appeared that they were subject
to the most extraordinary hallucinations and extravagant delusions, the
commonest being that the best thing that the working people could do to
bring about an improvement in their condition, was to continue to elect
their Liberal and Tory employers to make laws for and to rule over
them!At such times, if anyone ventured to point out to them that that
was what they had been doing all their lives, and referred them to the
manifold evidences that met them wherever they turned their eyes of its
folly and futility, they were generally immediately seized with a
paroxysm of the most furious mania, and were with difficulty prevented
from savagely assaulting those who differed from them.They were usually found in a similar condition of maniacal excitement
for some time preceding and during a Parliamentary election, but
afterwards they usually manifested that modification of insanity which
is called melancholia.In fact they alternated between these two forms
of the disease.During elections, the highest state of exalted mania;
and at ordinary times--presumably as a result of reading about the
proceedings in Parliament of the persons whom they had elected--in a
state of melancholic depression, in their case an instance of hope
deferred making the heart sick.This condition occasionally proved to be the stage of transition into
yet another modification of the disease--that known as dipsomania, the
phase exhibited by Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk.Yet another form of insanity was that shown by the Socialists.Like
most of their fellow passengers in the last coach, the majority of
these individuals appeared to be of perfectly sound mind.Upon
entering into conversation with them one found that they reasoned
correctly and even brilliantly.They had divided their favourite
subject into three parts.First; an exact definition of the condition
known as Poverty.Secondly; a knowledge of the causes of Poverty; and
thirdly, a rational plan for the cure of Poverty.Those who were
opposed to them always failed to refute their arguments, and feared,
and nearly always refused, to meet them in fair fight--in open
debate--preferring to use the cowardly and despicable weapons of
slander and misrepresentation.The fact that these Socialists never
encountered their opponents except to defeat them, was a powerful
testimony to the accuracy of their reasonings and the correctness of
their conclusions--and yet they were undoubtedly mad.One might
converse with them for an indefinite time on the three divisions of
their subject without eliciting any proofs of insanity, but directly
one inquired what means they proposed to employ in order to bring about
the adoption of their plan, they replied that they hoped to do so by
reasoning with the others!Although they had sense enough to understand the real causes of
poverty, and the only cure for poverty, they were nevertheless so
foolish that they entertained the delusion that it is possible to
reason with demented persons, whereas every sane person knows that to
reason with a maniac is not only fruitless, but rather tends to fix
more deeply the erroneous impressions of his disordered mind.The wagonette containing Rushton and his friends continued to fly over
the road, pursued by the one in which rode Crass, Bill Bates, and the
Semi-drunk; but notwithstanding all the efforts of the drunken driver,
they were unable to overtake or pass the smaller vehicle, and when they
reached the foot of the hill that led up to Windley the distance
between the two carriages rapidly increased, and the race was
reluctantly abandoned.When they reached the top of the hill Rushton and his friends did not
wait for the others, but drove off towards Mugsborough as fast as they
could.Crass's brake was the next to arrive at the summit, and they halted
there to wait for the other two conveyances and when they came up all
those who lived nearby got out, and some of them sang 'God Save the
King', and then with shouts of 'Good Night', and cries of 'Don't forget
six o'clock Monday morning', they dispersed to their homes and the
carriages moved off once more.At intervals as they passed through Windley brief stoppages were made
in order to enable others to get out, and by the time they reached the
top of the long incline that led down into Mugsborough it was nearly
twelve o'clock and the brakes were almost empty, the only passengers
being Owen and four or five others who lived down town.By ones and
twos these also departed, disappearing into the obscurity of the night,
until there was none left, and the Beano was an event of the past.Chapter 45

The Great Oration


The outlook for the approaching winter was--as usual--gloomy in the
extreme.One of the leading daily newspapers published an article
prophesying a period of severe industrial depression.'As the
warehouses were glutted with the things produced by the working
classes, there was no need for them to do any more work--at present;
and so they would now have to go and starve until such time as their
masters had sold or consumed the things already produced.'Of course,
the writer of the article did not put it exactly like that, but that
was what it amounted to.This article was quoted by nearly all the
other papers, both Liberal and Conservative.The Tory papers--ignoring
the fact that all the Protectionist countries were in exactly the same
condition, published yards of misleading articles about Tariff Reform.The Liberal papers said Tariff Reform was no remedy.Look at America
and Germany--worse than here!Still, the situation was undoubtedly
very serious--continued the Liberal papers--and Something would have to
be done.They did not say exactly what, because, of course, they did
not know; but Something would have to be done--tomorrow.They talked
vaguely about Re-afforestation, and Reclaiming of Foreshores, and Sea
walls: but of course there was the question of Cost!But all the same Something would have to be done.Great caution was necessary in dealing with
such difficult problems!We must go slow, and if in the meantime a few
thousand children die of starvation, or become 'rickety' or consumptive
through lack of proper nutrition it is, of course, very regrettable,
but after all they are only working-class children, so it doesn't
matter a great deal.Most of the writers of these Liberal and Tory papers seemed to think
that all that was necessary was to find 'Work' for the 'working' class!That was their conception of a civilized nation in the twentieth
century!For the majority of the people to work like brutes in order
to obtain a 'living wage' for themselves and to create luxuries for a
small minority of persons who are too lazy to work at all!And
although this was all they thought was necessary, they did not know
what to do in order to bring even that much to pass!Winter was
returning, bringing in its train the usual crop of horrors, and the
Liberal and Tory monopolists of wisdom did not know what to do!Rushton's had so little work in that nearly all the hands expected that
they would be slaughtered the next Saturday after the 'Beano' and there
was one man--Jim Smith he was called--who was not allowed to live even
till then: he got the sack before breakfast on the Monday morning after
the Beano.This man was about forty-five years old, but very short for his age,
being only a little over five feet in height.The other men used to
say that Little Jim was not made right, for while his body was big
enough for a six-footer, his legs were very short, and the fact that he
was rather inclined to be fat added to the oddity of his appearance.On the Monday morning after the Beano he was painting an upper room in
a house where several other men were working, and it was customary for
the coddy to shout 'Yo!at mealtimes, to let the hands know when
it was time to leave off work.At about ten minutes to eight, Jim had
squared the part of the work he had been doing--the window--so he
decided not to start on the door or the skirting until after breakfast.Whilst he was waiting for the foreman to shout 'Yo!his mind
reverted to the Beano, and he began to hum the tunes of some of the
songs that had been sung.He hummed the tune of 'He's a jolly good
fellow', and he could not get the tune out of his mind: it kept buzzing
in his head.It could not be very far
off eight now, to judge by the amount of work he had done since six
o'clock.He had rubbed down and stopped all the woodwork and painted
the window.He was only getting
sixpence-halfpenny an hour and if he hadn't earned a bob he hadn't
earned nothing!Anyhow, whether he had done enough for 'em or not he
wasn't goin' to do no more before breakfast.The tune of 'He's a jolly good fellow' was still buzzing in his head;
