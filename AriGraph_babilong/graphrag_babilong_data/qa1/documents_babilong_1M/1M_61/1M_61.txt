You're smitten with her," exclaimed Campbell, staring
aghast at his friend.Cyril flushed darkly under his tan."Certainly not, but I have the greatest respect for this unfortunate
young woman, and don't you forget it again."Believe what you like, but I didn't think you were the
sort of man who never credits a fellow with disinterested motives, if he
behaves half-way decently to a woman."You mustn't take offence so
easily.I have never seen the young lady, remember.And you know I will
help you even against my better judgment."Now let us first of all consider Miss Prentice's case
dispassionately.I want to be sure of my facts; then I may be able to
form some conjecture as to why Wilmersley was murdered and how the
jewels came into Miss Prentice's possession.You tell me that it has
been proved that she really left Geralton on the afternoon before the
murder?""Yes; the carrier swears he drove her into Newhaven and put her down
near the station.Further than that they have luckily not been able to
trace her.""Now your idea is that Miss Prentice, having in some way managed to
secure a car, returned to Geralton that evening and got into the castle
through the library window?""No, I doubt if she entered the castle.I can think of no reason why she
should have done so," said Cyril."In that case, how do you account for her injuries?Who could have
flogged her except your charming cousin?""Granting that she is Priscilla Prentice, the only hypothesis I can
think of which explains her predicament is this: Having planned to
rescue her mistress, she was only waiting for a favourable opportunity
to present itself.The doctor's visit determined her to act at once.I
agree with you that to re-enter Geralton was not her original intention,
but while waiting under the library window for Lady Wilmersley to join
her, she hears Wilmersley ill-treating his wife, so she climbs in and
rushes to the latter's assistance.""Yes, yes," assented Cyril with shining eyes."But she is overpowered by Wilmersley," continued Campbell, warming to
his theme, "who, insane with rage, flogs her unmercifully.Then Lady
Wilmersley, fearing the girl will be killed, seizes the pistol, which is
lying on the desk, and fires at her husband----"

"I am convinced that that is just what happened," cried Cyril."Don't be too sure of it; still, it seems to me that that theory hangs
together pretty well," Campbell complacently agreed."Of course, neither
woman contemplated murder.Wilmersley's death completely unnerved them.If the gardener's wife heard a cry coming from the car, it is possible
that one or the other had an attack of hysterics.Now about the
jewels--I believe Miss Prentice took charge of them, either because Lady
Wilmersley was unfit to assume such a responsibility or because they
agreed that she could the more easily dispose of them.I think that Miss
Prentice's hurried trip to town was undertaken not in order to avoid
arrest, but primarily to raise money, of which they must have had great
need, and possibly also to rejoin her mistress, who, now that we know
that she made her escape in a car, is probably hiding somewhere either
in London itself or in its vicinity."You have thought of everything," cried Cyril
admiringly."Of course, I may be quite wrong.These are only suppositions,
remember," Campbell modestly reminded him."By the way, what have you
done with the jewels?I can't believe that you are in any danger of
arrest, but if there is the remotest chance of such a thing, it wouldn't
look very well if they were found in your possession."I was even afraid that my rooms might be
searched in my absence, so I took them with me."I have hidden the bag and to-night I mean to burn
it.""Your pocket is not a very safe repository."That is why I want you to take charge of them," said Cyril."Oh, very well," sighed Campbell, with mock resignation."In for a
penny, in for a pound.I shall probably end by being arrested as a
receiver of stolen property!But now we must consider what we had better
do with Miss Prentice.""I think I shall hire a cottage in the country for her.""If you did that, the police would find her immediately.The only safe
hiding-place is a crowd."Now let me see: Where is she least likely to attract
attention?It must be a place where you could manage to see her without
being compromised, and, if possible, without being observed.In a huge caravansary like
that all sorts and conditions of people jostle each other without
exciting comment.Besides, the police are less likely to look among the
guests of such an expensive hotel for a poor maid servant or in such a
public resort for a fugitive from justice.""But in her present condition," continued Campbell, "I don't see how she
could remain there alone."But what trustworthy woman could you get to undertake such a
task?Perhaps one of the nurses----"

"No," Cyril hastily interrupted him."When she leaves the nursing home,
all trace of her must be lost.At any moment the police may discover
that a woman whom I have represented to be my wife has been a patient
there.That will naturally arouse their suspicions and they will do
their utmost to discover who it is that I am protecting with my name.For one thing, she would feel called upon to
report to the doctor.""You might bribe her not to do so," suggested Guy."I shouldn't dare to trust to an absolutely unknown quantity.Oh, if I
only knew a respectable woman on whom I could rely!I would pay her a
small fortune for her services.""I know somebody who might do," said Campbell."Her name is Miss Trevor
and she used to be my sister's governess.She is too old to teach now
and I fancy has a hard time to make both ends meet.The only trouble is
that she is so conscientious that she would rather starve than be mixed
up in anything she did not consider perfectly honourable and above
board.If I told her that she was to chaperon a young lady whom the
police were looking for, she would be so indignant that I doubt if she
would ever speak to me again.""It doesn't seem decent to inveigle her by false representations into
taking a position which she would never dream of accepting if she knew
the truth.""I will pay her L200 a year as long as she lives, if she will look after
Miss Prentice till this trouble is over.Even if the worst happens and
the girl is discovered, she can truthfully plead ignorance of the
latter's identity," urged Cyril."True, and two hundred a year is good pay even for unpleasant notoriety.Yes, on the whole I think I am justified in accepting the offer for her.But now we must consider what fairy tale we are going to concoct for her
benefit.""Oh, I don't know," sighed Cyril wearily."Imagination giving out, or conscience awakening--which is it?""Sorry, old man; but joking aside, we must really decide what we are to
tell Miss Trevor.You can no longer pose as Miss Prentice's husband----"

"Why not?""What possible excuse have you for doing so, now that she is to leave
the doctor's care?""I am sure it would have a very bad effect on Miss Prentice's health, if
I were to tell her that she is not my wife.""Remember, she is completely cut off from the past," urged Cyril; "she
has neither friend nor relation to cling to.I am the one person in the
world she believes she has a claim on.Besides,
the doctor's orders are that she shall not be in any way agitated."Now what explanation will you give
Miss Trevor for not living with your wife?""I shall say that her state of health renders it inadvisable for the
present.""I think we had better stick to Thompkins.Only we will spell it Tomkyns and change the Christian name to John.""But won't she confide what she believes to be her real name to Miss
Trevor?""I think not--not if I tell her I don't wish her to do so.She has a
great idea of wifely obedience, I assure you.""Well," laughed Guy, "that is a virtue which so few real wives possess
that it seems a pity it should be wasted on a temporary one.And now,
Cyril, we must decide on the best way and the best time for transferring
Miss Prentice to the hotel.""Unless something unexpected occurs to change our plans, I think she had
better be moved the day after to-morrow.I advise your starting as early
as possible before the world is well awake.Only be sure you
are not followed, that is all I ask.""I don't expect we shall be, but if we are, I think I can promise to
outwit them," Campbell assured him."I shall never forget what you are doing for me, Guy."I expect you to erect a monument commemorating my
virtues and my folly.Where are those stolen goods of
which I am to become the custodian?"I have done them up in several parcels, so that they are
not too bulky to carry.As I don't want the police to know how intimate
we are, it is better that we should not be seen together in public for
the present.""I think you are over-cautious.But perhaps," agreed Campbell, "we might
as well meet here till all danger is over."A few minutes later Cyril also left the club.His talk with Campbell had
been a great relief to him.As he walked briskly along, he felt
calm--almost cheerful.Turning quickly Cyril recognised Inspector Griggs.For a moment Cyril was too startled to speak.Then, pulling himself
together, he exclaimed with an attempt at heartiness:

"Why, Inspector!"I only left Newhaven this afternoon, but I think my work there is
finished--for the present at least.""No indeed, but the clue now leads away from Geralton."Cyril found it difficult to control the tremor in his
voice."If you'll excuse me, my lord, I had better keep my suppositions to
myself till I am able to verify them."Cyril felt he
could not let him go before he had ascertained exactly what he had to
fear.It was so awful, this fighting in the dark."If you have half an hour to spare, come to my rooms.Cyril was convinced that the Inspector knew where he
was staying and had been lying in wait for him.He thought it best to
pretend that he felt above suspicion.A few minutes later they were sitting before a blazing fire, the
Inspector puffing luxuriously at a cigar and sipping from time to time a
glass of whiskey and soda which Peter had reluctantly placed at his
elbow.Peter, as he himself would have put it, "did not hold with the
police," and thought his master was sadly demeaning himself by
fraternising with a member of that calling."I quite understand your reluctance to talk about a case," said Cyril,
reverting at once to the subject he had in mind; "but as this one so
nearly concerns my family and consequently myself, I think I have a
right to your confidence.I am most anxious to know what you have
discovered.I assure you, you can rely
on my discretion.""Well, my lord, it's a bit unprofessional, but seeing it's you, I don't
mind if I do.It's the newspaper men, I am afraid of.""I shall not mention what you tell me to any one except possibly to one
friend," Cyril hastily assured him.You see I may be all wrong, so I don't want to say
too much till I can prove my case.""I understand that," said Cyril; "and this clue that you are
following--what is it?""The car, my lord," answered the Inspector, settling himself deeper in
his chair, while his eyes began to gleam with suppressed excitement."You have found the car in which her ladyship made her escape?""I don't know about that yet, but I have found the car that stood at the
foot of the long lane on the night of the murder.""Oh, that's not so very wonderful," protested the Inspector with an
attempt at modesty, but he was evidently bursting with pride in his
achievement.asked Cyril with genuine
amazement."I began my search by trying to find out what cars had been seen in the
neighbourhood of Geralton on the night of the murder--by neighbourhood I
mean a radius of twenty-five miles.I found, as I expected, that
half-past eleven not being a favourite hour for motoring, comparatively
few had been seen or heard.Most of these turned out to be the property
of gentlemen who had no difficulty in proving that they had been used
only for perfectly legitimate purposes.There remained, however, two
cars of which I failed to get a satisfactory account.Benedict, a young man who owns a place about ten miles from
Geralton, and who seems to have spent the evening motoring wildly over
the country.He pretends he had no particular object, and as he is a bit
queer, it may be true.The other car is the property of the landlord of
the Red Lion Inn, a very respectable hotel in Newhaven.I then sent two
of my men to examine these cars and report if either of them has a new
tire, for the gardener's wife swore that the car she heard had burst
one.Benedict's tires all showed signs of wear, but the Red Lion car
has a brand new one!""Oh, that is nothing," replied the Inspector, vainly trying to suppress
a self-satisfied smile."Did you find any further evidence against this hotel-keeper?"He knew Lord Wilmersley slightly, but says he has never even seen her
Ladyship."In that case what part does he play in the affair?"You see he keeps the car for the convenience of his
guests and on the day in question it had been hired by two young
Frenchmen, who were out in it from two o'clock till midnight."But how could they have had anything to do with the
tragedy?"So far all I have been able to find out about
these two men is that they landed in Newhaven ten days before the
murder.They professed to be brothers and called themselves Joseph and
Paul Durand.They seemed to be amply provided with money and wanted the
best the hotel had to offer.Joseph Durand appeared a decent sort of
fellow, but the younger one drank.The waiters fancy that the elder man
used to remonstrate with him occasionally, but the youngster paid very
little attention to him.""You say they _professed_ to be brothers."For one reason, the elder one did not understand a word of English,
while the young one spoke it quite easily, although with a strong
accent.That is, he spoke it with a strong accent when he was sober, but
when under the influence of liquor this accent disappeared.""They left Newhaven the morning after the murder.Their departure was
very hurried, and the landlord is sure that the day before they had no
intention of leaving.""Have you been able to trace them farther?""Not yet, my lord, but I have sent one of my men to try and follow them
up, and I have notified the continental police to be on the look-out for
them.It's a pity that they have three days' start of us.""But as you have an accurate description of both, I should imagine that
they will soon be found.""It's through the young 'un they'll be caught, if they are caught.""Why, is he deformed in any way?""No, my lord, but they tell me he is abnormally small for a man of his
age, for he must be twenty-two or three at the very least.The landlord
believes that he is a jockey who had got into bad habits, and that the
elder man is his trainer or backer.Of course, he may be right, but the
waiters pooh-pooh the idea.They insist that the boy is a gentleman-born
and servants are pretty good judges of such things, though you mightn't
think it, my lord.""I can quite believe it," assented Cyril."But then there are many
gentlemen jockeys."I only wish I had seen the little fellow, for they all
agree that there was something about him which would make it impossible
for any one who had once met him ever to forget him again."They also tell me that if his eyes had not been so
bloodshot, and if he had not looked so drawn and haggard, he'd have been
an extraordinarily good-looking chap."It seems that he has large blue eyes, a fine little nose, not a
bit red as you would expect, and as pretty a mouth as ever you'd see.His hair is auburn and he wears it rather long, which I don't think he'd
do if he were a jockey.Besides, his skin is as fine as a baby's, though
its colour is a grey-white with only a spot of red in the middle of each
cheek.""He must be a queer-looking beggar!"That's why I think we shall soon spot him.""What did the elder Durand look like?"He is about twenty-eight years old,
medium height, and inclined to be stout.He has dark hair, a little thin
at the temples, dark moustache, and dark eyes."On the night of the murder you say they returned to the hotel at about
midnight?""The porter was so sleepy that he can't remember much about it.He had
an impression that they came in arm in arm and went quietly upstairs.""But what do you think they had done with Lady Wilmersley?""But, my lord, you didn't expect that they would bring her to the hotel,
did you?If they were her friends, their first care would be for her
safety.If they were not--well, we will have to look for another victim,
that is all.""I mustn't
keep you any longer."He hesitated a moment, eyeing Cyril doubtfully.There was evidently still something he wished to say.Cyril had also risen to his feet and stood leaning against the
mantelpiece, idly wondering at the man's embarrassment."I trust her Ladyship has quite recovered?"CHAPTER XI

THE INSPECTOR INTERVIEWS CYRIL


Cyril felt the muscles of his face stiffen.He had for days been
dreading some such question, yet now that it had finally come, it had
found him completely unprepared.He must
fight for her till the last ditch.But how devilishly clever of Griggs to have deferred his attack until he
was able to catch his adversary off his guard!Cyril looked keenly but,
he hoped, calmly at the Inspector.Their eyes met, but without the clash
which Cyril had expected.The man's expression, although searching, was
not hostile; in fact, there was something almost apologetic about his
whole attitude.Griggs was not sure of his ground, that much was
obvious.He knew something, he probably suspected more, but there was
still a chance that he might be led away from the trail.Cyril's mind worked with feverish rapidity.He realised that it was
imperative that his manner should appear perfectly natural.He must first decide what his position,
viewed from Griggs's standpoint, really was.He must have a definite
conception of his part before he attempted to act it.The Inspector evidently knew that a young woman, who bore Cyril's name,
had been taken ill on the Newhaven train.He was no doubt also aware
that she was now under the care of Dr.But if the
Inspector really believed the girl to be his wife, these facts were in
no way incriminating.He must, therefore, know
more of the truth.No, for if he had discovered that the girl was not
Lady Wilmersley, Cyril was sure that Griggs would not have broached the
subject so tentatively.He had told every one who inquired about his wife that she
was still on the continent.Peter, also, obeying his orders, had
repeated the same story in the servants' hall.And, of course, Griggs
knew that they were both lying.I
have not mentioned it to any one."Cyril flattered himself that his
voice had exactly the right note of slightly displeased surprise.Yes,
for Griggs's expression relaxed and he answered with a smile that was
almost deprecating:

"I, of course, saw the report of the man who searched the train, and I
was naturally surprised to find that the only lady who had taken her
ticket in Newhaven was Mrs.In a case like this we have
to verify everything, so when I discovered that the gentleman who was
with her, was undoubtedly your Lordship, it puzzled me a good deal why
both you and your valet should be so anxious to keep her Ladyship's
presence in England a secret.""Yes, yes, it must have astonished you, and I confess I am very sorry
you found me out," said Cyril.The old lie must be
told once more."Her Ladyship is suffering from a--a nervous affection.""In fact--she has just left an insane asylum,"
he finally blurted out."You mean that the present Lady Wilmersley--not the Dowager--?"The
Inspector was too surprised to finish his sentence."Yes, it's queer, isn't it, that both should be afflicted in the same
way," agreed Cyril, calmly lighting a cigarette."Most remarkable," ejaculated Griggs, staring fixedly at Cyril."As the doctors believe that her Ladyship will completely recover, I
didn't want any one to know that she had ever been unbalanced.But I
might have known that it was bound to leak out.""We are no gossips, my lord; I shall not mention what you have told me
to any one.""They have got too much to do, to bother about what doesn't concern
them.I don't believe a dozen of them noticed that in searching the
train for one Lady Wilmersley, they had inadvertently stumbled on
another, and as the latter had nothing to do with their case, they
probably dismissed the whole thing from their minds."Well, you see, it's different with me.It's the business of my men to
bring me isolated facts, but I have to take a larger view of
the--the--the--ah--possibilities.I have got to think of
everything--suspect every one.""Your Lordship would have no difficulty in proving an alibi.""So you took the trouble to find that out?"I should really like to know what could have led you to
suspect me?""I didn't suspect you, my lord.You see, Lady
Wilmersley must have had an accomplice and you must acknowledge that it
was a strange coincidence that your Lordship should have happened to
pass through Newhaven at that particular moment, especially as the
Newhaven route is not very popular with people of your means."As a matter of fact, I had no intention of taking it, but I
missed the Calais train.""I see," Griggs nodded his head as if the explanation fully satisfied
him."Would you mind, my lord," he continued after a brief pause, "if,
now that we are on the subject, I asked you a few questions?There are
several points which are bothering me.Of course, don't answer, if you
had rather not.""You mean if my answers are likely to incriminate me.Well, I don't
think they will, so fire ahead," drawled Cyril, trying to express by his
manner a slight weariness of the topic.Griggs looked a trifle abashed, but he persisted."I have been wondering how it was that you met her Ladyship in Newhaven,
if you had no previous intention of taking that route?"The fact is, her Ladyship escaped from an
asylum near Fontainebleau over a fortnight ago.I scoured France for her
but finally gave up the search, and leaving the French detectives to
follow up any clue that might turn up, I decided almost on the spur of
the moment to run over to England.I was never more astonished than when
I found her on the train."She was rather excited and I asked no questions.""Had she ever before visited Newhaven to your knowledge?""Then she did not know the late Lord Wilmersley?"inquired the detective, looking keenly
at Cyril."I was never very friendly with my cousin, and we sailed for South
Africa immediately after our marriage.Neither of us has been home since
then.""I must find out where she spent the night of the murder," murmured the
Inspector.He seemed to have forgotten Cyril's presence."If you think her Ladyship had anything to do with the tragedy, I assure
you, you are on the wrong track," cried Cyril, forgetting for a moment
his pose of polite aloofness.It is
chiefly her memory that is affected.Until the last few days what she
did one minute, she forgot the next.""You think, therefore, that she would not be able to tell me how she
spent her time in Newhaven?"By the way, how has she taken the news of
Lord Wilmersley's murder?"She does not even know that he is dead.""I see I must explain her case more fully, so that you may be able to
understand my position.Her Ladyship's mind became affected about six
months ago, owing to causes into which I need not enter now.Since her
arrival in England her improvement has been very rapid.Her memory is
growing stronger, but it is essential that it should not be taxed for
the present.The doctor assures me that if she is kept perfectly quiet
for a month or so, she will recover completely.That is why I want her
to remain in absolute seclusion.An incautious word might send her off
her balance.She must be protected from people, and I will protect her,
I warn you of that.Six weeks from now, if all goes well, you can
cross-question her, if you still think it necessary, but at present I
not only forbid it, but I will do all in my power to prevent it.Of
course," continued Cyril more calmly, "I have neither the power nor the
desire to hamper you in the exercise of your profession; so if you doubt
my statements just ask Dr.Stuart-Smith whether he thinks her Ladyship
has ever been in a condition when she might have committed murder.He
will laugh at you, I am sure.""I don't doubt it, my lord; all the same--" Griggs hesitated."All the same you would like to know what her Ladyship did on the night
of the murder.I assure you that although
our motives differ, my curiosity equals yours."I shall certainly do my best to solve the riddle,"
said the Inspector as he bowed himself out.Cyril sank wearily into a chair.The interview had been a great strain,
and yet he felt that in a way it had been a relief also.He flattered
himself that he had played his cards rather adroitly.For now that he
had found out exactly how much the police knew, he might possibly
circumvent them.Of course, it was merely a question of days, perhaps
even of hours, before Griggs would discover that the girl was not his
wife; for the Inspector was nothing if not thorough and if he once began
searching Newhaven for evidence of her stay there, Cyril was sure that
it would not take him long to establish her identity.If he only had
Griggs fighting on his side, instead of the little pompous fool of a
Judson!By the way, what could have become of Judson?It was now two
full days since he had left Geralton.He certainly ought to have
reported himself long before this.Well, it made no difference one way
or the other.Cyril had no time to think
of him now.His immediate concern was to find a way by which Priscilla
could be surreptitiously removed from the nursing home, before the
police had time to collect sufficient evidence to warrant her arrest.Cyril sat for half an hour staring at the
smouldering fire before he was able to hit on a plan that seemed to him
at all feasible.Going to the writing-table, he rapidly covered three sheets and thrust
them into an envelope."Yes, sir," answered a sleepy voice."You are to take this letter at half-past seven o'clock to-morrow
morning to Mr.Campbell's rooms and give it into his own hands.If he is
still asleep, wake him up.You can go to bed now----"

It was lucky, thought Cyril, that he had taken Guy into his confidence.For,
notwithstanding his careless manner, he was _au fond_ a conventional
soul.It was really comical to think of that impeccable person as a
receiver of stolen property.What would he do with the jewels, Cyril
wondered.He must get rid of it at
once.Poking the fire into a blaze, he cautiously locked the two doors
which connected his rooms with the rest of the house.Then, having
assured himself that the blinds were carefully drawn and that no one was
secreted about the premises, he knelt down before the empty fireplace in
his bedroom and felt up the chimney.CHAPTER XII

A PERILOUS VENTURE


In the grey dawn of the following morning Cyril was already up and
dressed.The first thing he did was to detach two of the labels affixed
to his box and place them carefully in his pocketbook.That
accomplished, he had to wait with what patience he could muster until
Peter returned with Campbell's reply.It was
evidently satisfactory, for he heaved a sigh of relief as he sat down to
breakfast.His eyes, however, never left the clock and it had hardly
finished striking nine before our hero was out of the house.No
suspicious person was in sight, but Cyril, was determined to take no
chances.He therefore walked quickly ahead, then turned so abruptly that
he would necessarily have surprised any one who was following him.This
he did many times till he reached Piccadilly Circus, where, with a last
look behind him, he bolted into a shop.There he asked for a small
travelling box suitable for a lady.Having chosen one, he took his
labels out of his pocket."Have these pasted on the box," he ordered.The man's face expressed such amazement that Cyril hastened to remark
that the box was intended for a bride who did not wish to be identified
as such by the newness of her baggage.A comprehending and sympathetic
smile proved that the explanation was satisfactory.A few minutes later
Cyril drove off with his new acquisition.The next purchase was a
handsomely-fitted lady's dressing-bag, which he took to Trufitt's and
filled with such toilet accessories as a much-befrizzled young person
designated as indispensable to a lady's comfort.On leaving there he
stopped for a moment at his bank.Cyril now metaphorically girded his loins and summoning up all his
courage, plunged into a shop in Bond Street, where he remembered his
mother used to get what she vaguely termed "her things."Among the maze
of frou-frous he stood in helpless bewilderment, till an obsequious
floor-walker came to his rescue.Cyril explained that he had a box
outside which he wanted to fill then and there with a complete outfit
for a young lady.To his relief the man showed no surprise at so unusual
a request and he was soon ensconced in the blessed seclusion of a
fitting room.There the box was hurriedly packed with a varied
assortment of apparel, which he devoutly prayed would meet with
Priscilla's approval.The doctor must have
left the nursing home by this time, thought Cyril.Not wishing to attract attention by driving up to the door, he told the
chauffeur to stop when they were still at some distance away from it.There he got out and looked anxiously about him.To his relief he
recognised Campbell's crimson pate hovering in the distance.So far,
thought Cyril triumphantly, there had been no hitch in his
carefully-laid plans."You are to wait here," he said, turning to the driver, "for a lady and
a red-haired gentleman.Now understand, no one but a red-haired man is
to enter this car.Here is a pound, and if you don't make a mess of
things, the other gentleman will give you two more.""All right, sir; thank you, sir," exclaimed the astonished chauffeur,
greedily pocketing the gold piece.Cyril was certain that he had not been followed, and there was no sign
that the nursing home was being watched, but that did not reassure him.Those curtained windows opposite might conceal a hundred prying eyes.When he was ushered into Miss Prentice's room, he was surprised to find
her already up and dressed.She held a mirror in one hand and with the
other was arranging a yellow wig, which encircled her face like an
aureole.Cyril could hardly restrain a cry of admiration.He had thought
her lovely before, but now her beauty was absolutely startling.On catching sight of him she dropped the mirror and ran to him with
outstretched hands.Cyril heroically disengaged himself from her soft, clinging clasp and
not daring to allow his eyes to linger on her upturned face, he surveyed
the article in question judicially.I can't say, however, that I like anything
artificial," he asserted mendaciously.she cried, and the corners of her mouth began
to droop in a way he had already begun to dread.Nurse tells me it will take ages and ages for it to grow again.""There, there, my dear, it's all right.You look lovely--" he paused
abruptly."I am so glad you think
so!"This sort of thing must stop, he
determined."I would like to ask you one thing.""Then I could afford to have some pretty clothes?"I can't bear the ones I have on.I can't think why I
ever bought anything so ugly.I shall throw them away as soon as I can
get others.Nurse tells me that I arrived
here with nothing but a small hand-bag.""It has gone astray," he stammered."It will turn up soon, no doubt, but
in the meantime I have bought a few clothes for your immediate use."He must introduce the subject of her
departure tactfully."It is waiting a little farther down the street.""Then, believe me, it is necessary for you to leave this place
immediately.I--you--are being pursued by some one who--who wishes to
separate us.""But how can any one separate us, when
God has joined us together?""It's a long story and I have no time to explain it now.All I ask is
that you will trust me blindly for the present, and do exactly what I
tell you to.""I will," she murmured submissively.The same middle-aged woman appeared of whom he had caught a glimpse on
his former visit."I am sorry, but he has just left."Cyril knitted his brows as if the doctor's absence was an
unexpected disappointment.Thompkins must leave here at once and I
wanted to explain her precipitate departure to him.""Yes, or better still, I shall call at his office.But his absence
places me in a most awkward predicament."Cyril paced the room several times as if in deep thought, then halted
before the nurse."Well, there is no help for it.As the doctor is not here, I must
confide in you.The doctor knows what
that is and it was on his advice that we discarded it for the time
being.I can't tell you our reason for this concealment nor why my wife
must not only leave this house as soon as possible, but must do so
unobserved."I--I don't know, sir," answered the nurse dubiously, staring at Cyril
in amazement."If you will dress my wife in a nurse's uniform and see that she gets
out of here without being recognised, I will give you L100.The nurse gave a gasp and backed away from the notes, which Cyril held
temptingly toward her."Oh, I couldn't, sir, really I couldn't."I promise you on my word of honour that the doctor need never know that
you helped us.""Do you think I am trying to
bribe you to do something dishonourable?"Look at my wife, does she look like a criminal, I ask
you?""She certainly doesn't," answered the nurse, glancing eagerly from one
to the other and then longingly down at the money in Cyril's hand."Well, then, why not trust your instinct in the matter?My wife and I
have been placed, through no fault of our own, in a very disagreeable
position.You will know the whole story some day, but for the present my
lips are sealed.International complications might arise if the truth
leaked out prematurely."Cyril felt that the last was a neat touch, for
the woman's face cleared and she repeated in an awe-struck voice:
"International complications!"I can say no more," added Cyril in a stage whisper."One never knows what they will be
at next.I ought to have known at once that
it was sure to be all right.Any one can see that you are a gentleman--a
soldier, I dare say?"It is better that you should be able
truthfully to plead your complete ignorance.Now as to the uniform; have
you one to spare?""All this mystery frightens me," exclaimed Priscilla as soon as they
were alone.Now listen attentively to what I am saying.On
leaving here----"

"Oh, aren't you going with me?""No, we must not be seen together, but I will join you later.""Very well, now tell me what I am to do.""On leaving this house you are to turn to your right and walk down the
street till you see a taxi with a box on it.A friend of mine, Guy
Campbell, will be inside.You can easily recognise him; he has red hair.Campbell will drive you to a hotel where a lady is waiting for you and
where you are to stay till I can join you.If there should be any hitch
in these arrangements, go to this address and send a telegram to me at
the club.I have written all this down," he said, handing her a folded
paper.The nurse returned with her arms full of clothes."There is a long one attached to the bonnet, but we never pull it over
our faces, and I am afraid if Mrs.Thompkins did so, it would attract
attention.""Yet something must be done to conceal her face."I used to help in private theatricals once upon
a time."I will go downstairs now and wait till you have got
Mrs."Give me a quarter of an hour and you will be astonished at the result."She seemed to have thrown her whole heart into the business.When Cyril returned, he found Priscilla really transformed.Her yellow
curls had been plastered down on either side of her forehead.A pair of
tinted spectacles dimmed the brilliancy of her eyes and her dark,
finely-arched eyebrows had been rendered almost imperceptible by a
skilful application of grease and powder.With a burnt match the nurse
had drawn a few faint lines in the girlish face, so that she looked at
least ten years older, and all this artifice was made to appear natural
by means of a dingy, black net veil.A nurse's costume completed the
disguise.I can't thank you enough," he exclaimed.cried Priscilla a little ruefully.You are not
noticeable one way or the other.If we are seen, it will be supposed that she is some friend of
mine who has been calling on me.I will watch till I see her safely in
the car," the nurse assured him."By the way, as I have to pretend not to know of my patient's departure,
I had better not return till you have left."I shall stay here a quarter of an hour so
as to give you a good start.The next fifteen minutes seemed to Cyril the longest he had ever spent.He did not even dare to follow Priscilla's progress from the window.Watch in hand he waited till the time was up and then made his way
cautiously out of the house without, as luck would have it, encountering
any one.With a light heart Cyril walked briskly
to the doctor's office."Well, Lord Wilmersley, what brings you here?"asked the doctor, when
Cyril was finally ushered into the august presence."I have called to tell you that my wife has left the nursing home,"
Cyril blurted out.The
nurse would----"

"The nurse had nothing to do with it," interrupted Cyril hastily."It
was I who took her away."I thought you had decided to wait till
to-morrow.""For family reasons, which I need not go into now, I thought it best
that she should be removed at once."inquired the doctor, looking searchingly
at Cyril."I intend to take her to Geralton--in--in a few days."The doctor's upper lip lengthened perceptibly."So you do not wish me to know where you have hidden her."Cyril raised his eyebrows deprecatingly."That is a
strange expression to use.It seems to me that a man has certainly the
right to withhold his wife's address from a comparative stranger without
being accused of hiding her.You should really choose your words more
carefully, my dear sir."The doctor glared at Cyril for a moment, then rising abruptly he paced
the room several times."It's no use," he said at last, stopping in front of Cyril."You can't
persuade me that there is not some mystery connected with Lady
Wilmersley.And I warn you that I have determined to find out the
truth."Cyril's heart gave an uncomfortable jump, but he managed to keep his
face impassive.A man of your imagination is really
wasted in the medical profession.You should write, my dear doctor, you
really should.But, granting for the sake of argument that I have
something to conceal, what right have you to try to force my confidence?My wife's movements are surely no concern of yours.""One has not only the right, but it becomes one's obvious duty to
interfere, when one has reason to believe that by doing so one may
prevent the ill-treatment of a helpless woman.""Do you really think I ill-treat my wife?"And till I am sure that my fears are unfounded,
I will not consent to Lady Wilmersley's remaining in your sole care.""Do you mind telling me what basis you have for such a monstrous
suspicion?"You bring me a young lady who has been flogged.You tell me
that she is your wife, yet you profess to know nothing of her injuries
and give an explanation which, although not impossible, is at all events
highly improbable.This lady, who is not only beautiful but charming,
you neglect in the most astonishing manner.No, I am not forgetting that
you had other pressing duties to attend to, but even so, if you had
cared for your wife, you could not have remained away from her as you
did.It was nothing less than heartless to leave a poor young woman, in
the state she was in, alone among strangers.Your letter only partially
satisfied me.Your arguments would have seemed to me perfectly
unconvincing, if I had not been so anxious to believe the best.As it
was, although I tried to ignore it, a root of suspicion still lingered
in my mind.Then, when you finally do turn up, instead of hurrying to
your wife's bedside you try in every way to avoid meeting her till at
last I have to insist upon your doing so.I tell you, that if she had
not shown such marked affection for you, I should have had no doubt of
your guilt."Do I look like a wife-beater?""No, but the only murderess I ever knew looked like one of Raphael's
Madonnas."Thompkins," continued the doctor, "the more I
became convinced that a severe shock was responsible for her amnesia,
and that she had never been insane nor was she at all likely to become
so.""Even physicians are occasionally mistaken in their diagnosis, I have
been told.""You are right; that is why I have given you the benefit of the doubt,"
replied the doctor calmly."This morning, however, I made a discovery,
which practically proves that my suspicions were not unfounded.""And pray what is this great discovery of yours?""I had been worrying about this case all night, when it suddenly
occurred to me to consult the peerage.I wanted to find out who Lady
Wilmersley's people were, so that I might communicate with them if I
considered it necessary.The first thing I found was that your wife was
born in 18--, so that now she is in her twenty-eighth year.My patient
is certainly not more than twenty.How do you account for this
discrepancy in their ages?"Cyril forced himself to smile superciliously."And is my wife's youthful appearance your only reason for doubting her
identity?"The doctor seemed a little staggered by Cyril's nonchalant manner."It is my chief reason, but as I have just taken the trouble to explain,
not my only one."And if she is not my wife, whom do you suspect her of
being?"In trying to conceal his agitation Cyril
unfortunately assumed an air of frigid detachment, which only served to
exasperate the doctor still further.The doctor glared at Cyril for a moment but seemed at a loss for a
crushing reply."You must acknowledge that appearances are against you," he said at
last, making a valiant effort to control his temper."If you are a man
of honour, you ought to appreciate that my position is a very difficult
one and to be as ready to forgive me, if I have erred through excessive
zeal, as I shall be to apologise to you.Now let me ask you one more
question.Why were you so anxious that I should not see the jewels?"I thought, of course, that you had.I
apologise for not having satisfied your curiosity."There was a short pause during which the doctor looked long and
searchingly at Cyril.I feel that there is something fishy about this
business."I was not aware that I was trying to do so.""Lord Wilmersley--for I suppose you are Lord Wilmersley?""Unless I am his valet, Peter Thompkins.""I know nothing about you," cried the doctor, "and you have succeeded to
your title under very peculiar circumstances, my lord.""So you suspect me not only of flogging my wife but of murdering my
cousin!""My dear doctor, don't you realise that if there
were the slightest grounds for your suspicions, the police would have
put me under surveillance long ago.Why, I can easily prove that I was
in Paris at the time of the murder."I don't doubt that you have an impeccable alibi.But if I informed the police that you were passing off as your wife a
girl several years younger than Lady Wilmersley, a girl, moreover, who,
you acknowledged, joined you at Newhaven the very morning after the
murder--if I told them that this young lady had in her possession a
remarkable number of jewels, which she carried in a cheap, black
bag--what do you think they would say to that, my lord?"Cyril felt cold chills creeping down his back and the palms of his hands
grew moist.Not a flicker of an eyelash, however, betrayed his inward
tumult."They would no doubt pay as high a tribute to your imagination
as I do," he answered.Then, abandoning his careless pose, he sat up in his chair."You have been insulting me for the last half-hour, and I have borne it
very patiently, partly because your absurd suspicions amused me, and
partly because I realised that, although you are a fool, you are an
honest fool.""You can hardly resent being called a fool by a man you have been
accusing of murder and wife-beating.But I don't want you to go to the
police with this cock-and-bull story----"

"Ah!"Because," continued Cyril, ignoring the interruption, "I want to
protect my wife from unpleasant notoriety, and also, although you don't
deserve it, to keep you from becoming a public laughing stock.So far
you have done all the talking; now you are to listen to me.You make me nervous strutting about like that.Now let us see what all this rigmarole really
amounts to.You began by asking for my wife's address, and when I did
not immediately gratify what I considered your impertinent curiosity,
you launch forth into vague threats of exposure.As far as I can make
out from your disjointed harangue, your excuse for prying into my
affairs is that by doing so you are protecting a helpless woman from
further ill-treatment.Granting that you really suppose me to
be a brute, your behaviour might be perfectly justified if--if you
believed that your patient is my wife.You think that she is either my mistress or my accomplice, or both.Now,
if she is a criminal and an immoral woman, you must admit that she has
shown extraordinary cleverness, inasmuch as she succeeded not only in
eluding the police but in deceiving you.For the impression she made on
you was a very favourable one, was it not?She seemed to you unusually
innocent as well as absolutely frank, didn't she?""Now, if she was able to dupe so trained an observer as yourself, she
must be a remarkable woman, and cannot be the helpless creature you
picture her, and consequently would be in no danger of being forced to
submit to abuse from any one.""But I think I can prove to you that you were not mistaken in your first
estimate of her character.This illness of hers--was it real or could it
have been feigned?""You saw her when she was only semi-conscious, when she was physically
incapable of acting a part--did she during that time, either by word or
look, betray moral perversity?"The doctor's anger had abated and he was listening to
Cyril intently."How, then, can you doubt her?And if she is what she seems, she is
certainly neither my mistress nor a thief; and if she is not the one nor
the other, she must be my wife, and if you go to the police with your
absurd suspicions, you will only succeed in making yourself ridiculous."There was a pause during which the two men eyed each other keenly."You make a great point of the fact that my wife had in her possession a
number of valuable ornaments," continued Cyril.My wife insisted on having all her jewelry with her at Charleroi, and
when she escaped from there, they were among the few things she took
with her.The excitement of meeting her so unexpectedly and her sudden
illness made me forget all about them, otherwise I would have taken them
out of the bag, which, as you may have noticed, was not even locked.But
the very fact that I did forget all about them and allowed them to pass
through the hands of nurses and servants, that alone ought to convince
you that I did not come by them dishonestly.You had them for days in
your possession; yet you accuse me of having prevented you from
examining them.Your whole case against me is
built on the wildest conjectures, from which you proceed to draw
perfectly untenable inferences.My wife looks young for her age, I grant
you; but even you would not venture to swear positively that she is not
twenty-eight.You fancied that I neglected her; consequently I am a
brute.She is sane now; so you believe that she has never been
otherwise.You imagined that I did not wish you to examine the contents
of my wife's bag, therefore the Wilmersley jewels must have been in it.""What you say sounds plausible enough," acknowledged the doctor, "and it
seems impossible to associate you with anything cruel, mean, or even
underhand, and yet--and yet--I have an unaccountable feeling that you
are not telling me the truth.When I try to analyse my impressions, I
find that I distrust not you but your story.You have, however,
convinced me that I have no logical basis for my suspicions.That being
the case, I shall do nothing for the present.But, if at the end of a
fortnight I do not hear that Lady Wilmersley has arrived in England, and
has taken her place in the world, then I shall believe that my instinct
has not been at fault, and shall do my best to find out what has become
of her, even at the risk of creating a scandal or of being laughed at
for my pains.But I don't care, I shall feel that I have done my duty.Now I have given you a fair
warning, which you can act on as you see fit."What an unerring scent the man had for falsehood, thought Cyril with
unwilling admiration.It was really wonderful the way he disregarded
probabilities and turned a deaf ear to reason.He was a big man, Cyril
grudgingly admitted."I suppose you will not believe me if I tell you that I have no personal
animosity toward you, Lord Wilmersley?"And some day we'll laugh over this episode together,"
replied Cyril, with a heartiness which surprised himself."Now that is nice of you," cried the doctor."My temper is rather hasty,
I am sorry to say, and though I don't remember all I said just now, I am
sure, I was unnecessarily disagreeable.""Well, I called you a fool," grinned Cyril."So you did, so you did, and may I live to acknowledge that I richly
deserve the appellation."And so their interview terminated with unexpected friendliness.CHAPTER XIII

CAMPBELL REMONSTRATES


In his note to Guy, Cyril had asked the latter to join him at his club
as soon as he had left Priscilla at the hotel, and so when the time
passed and his friend neither came nor telephoned, Cyril's anxiety knew
no bounds.In
that case, however, Guy would surely have communicated with him at once,
for the police could have had no excuse for detaining the latter.Several acquaintances he had not seen for years greeted him cordially,
but he met their advances so half-heartedly that they soon left him to
himself, firmly convinced that the title had turned his head.Only one,
an old friend of his father's, refused to be shaken off and sat prosing
away quite oblivious of his listener's preoccupation till the words
"your wife" arrested Cyril's wandering attention."Yes," the Colonel was saying, "too bad that you should have this added
worry just now.Taken ill on the train, too--most awkward."Cyril was so startled that he could only repeat idiotically: "My wife?"exclaimed the Colonel, evidently at a loss to understand
Cyril's perturbation."Your wife is in town, isn't she, and ill?"Cyril realised at once that he ought to have foreseen that this was
bound to have occurred.Too many people knew the story for it not to
have leaked out eventually."I have not had time to read them to-day," replied Cyril as soon as he
was able to collect his wits a little."Only that your wife had been prostrated by the shock of Wilmersley's
murder, and had to be removed from the train to a nursing home.""It's a bore that it got into the papers.My wife is only suffering from
a slight indisposition and will be all right in a day or two," Cyril
hastened to assure him."She--she is still at the nursing home--but she is leaving there
to-morrow."Then fearing that more questions were impending, Cyril
seized the Colonel's hand and shaking it vehemently exclaimed: "I must
write some letters.So glad to have had this chat with you," and without
giving the Colonel time to answer, he fled from the room.Suddenly an alarming possibility occurred to him,--what if
the police had traced the jewels to Campbell?The bag, which had
disappeared, must have been taken by them.Griggs, when he inquired so
innocently about "Lady Wilmersley," had been fully cognisant of the
girl's identity.He could not remain passive
and await developments.He must--was that--could that be Campbell
sauntering so leisurely toward him?asked Cyril in a hoarse whisper, dragging his
friend into a secluded corner.I am afraid I kept you waiting longer than I
intended to.Guy seemed, however,
quite unconcerned.How could you
have kept me in such suspense?Why didn't you come to me at once on
leaving Miss Prentice?"The governess, Miss What's her name, is
with her?"Thompkins alone with a
stranger in a strange place, so I stayed and lunched with them."_He_ had had no lunch at all.He had been
too upset to think of such a thing and all the time they--oh!He would never forgive
him, thought Cyril, scowling down at the complacent offender.For he was
complacent, that was the worst of it.From the top of his sleek, red
head to the tips of his immaculate boots, he radiated a triumphant
self-satisfaction.There was a jauntiness about him--a light in
his eyes which Cyril did not remember to have noticed before.And what
was the meaning of those two violets drooping so sentimentally in his
buttonhole?Cyril stared at the flowers as if hypnotised.he managed to say, controlling himself
with an effort.But I say, Cyril, it's all rot about her being that Prentice
woman."asked Cyril, forgetting his indignation in
his surprise at this new development."We had a duffer of a waiter who understood very little English, so Mrs.Thompkins spoke to him in French, and such French!How could a girl brought up in a small inland
village, which she had left only six months before, have learnt French?And then he remembered that the doctor had told him that she had
retained a dim recollection of Paris.Why had the significance of that
fact not struck him before?"But if she is not Priscilla Prentice, who on earth can she be?She
can't be Anita Wilmersley!"She--she--" Guy paused at a loss for a suggestion."And yet, if she is not the sempstress, she must be Anita!""I don't believe they are the Wilmersley jewels----"

"There is no doubt as to that.I have the list somewhere and you can
easily verify it."It may have been left in the seat by some one
else.""But you proved to me last night that she could not be Lady Wilmersley,"
insisted Guy.Anita has masses of bright, yellow hair."Well, then----"

"There seems no possible explanation to the enigma," acknowledged Cyril.When she fainted I loosened her veil and a strand of her
hair caught in my fingers.It was her own, I can swear to that.""I never thought of that," exclaimed Cyril."No, I don't think she could
have had time to dye it.At nine, when she
was last seen, she had made no attempt to alter her appearance.Now
Wilmersley was----"

"Hold on," cried Guy."You told me, did you not, that she had cut off
her hair because it had turned white?""Very well, then, that disposes of the possibility of its having been
dyed."And yet, she carried the Wilmersley jewels, that is a fact
we must not forget.""Then she must be a hitherto unsuspected factor in the case.""Possibly, and yet---"

"Yet what?""I confess I have no other solution to offer.Oh, by the way, what is
the number of her room?"I particularly asked you to make a note of it!"Guy's face was averted and he toyed nervously with his
eye-glass.You must realise--in fact we discussed it
together--that I must be able to see her.""As there is nothing that you can do for her, why should you compromise
her still further?""I mean that you ought not to take further advantage of her peculiar
affliction so as to play the part of a devoted husband.""This is outrageous--" began Cyril, but Campbell cut him short."While you fancied that she was in need of your assistance, I grant that
there was some excuse for your conduct, but to continue the farce any
longer would be positively dishonourable."Cyril was so surprised at Campbell's belligerent tone that for a moment
it rendered him speechless.From a boy Guy had always been his humble
admirer.What could have wrought this sudden change in him?Again his eyes lingered on the violets.And
yet Cyril had often suspected that under Guy's obvious shrewdness there
lurked a vein of romanticism.And as Cyril surveyed his friend, his
wrath slowly cooled.For the first time it occurred to him that
Campbell's almost comic exterior must be a real grief to a man of his
temperament.His own appearance had always seemed to Cyril such a
negligible quantity that he shrank from formulating even in his own mind
the reason why he felt that it would be absurd to fear Guy as a rival.A
man who is not to be feared is a man to be pitied, and it was this
unacknowledged pity, together with a sudden suspicion of the possible
tragedy of his friend's life, which allayed Cyril's indignation and made
him finally reply gently:

"I think you are mistaken.Miss Trevor and I are quite able to look after her.""I don't doubt your goodwill, my dear Guy, but what about her feelings?"Do
you imagine that she will be inconsolable at your absence?""You appear to forget that she believes me to be her husband.Her
pride--her vanity will be hurt if I appear to neglect her."Cyril still
spoke very quietly."Then I will tell her the truth at once," exclaimed Campbell."And risk the recurrence of her illness?Remember the doctor insisted
that she must on no account be agitated.""Why should it agitate her to be told that you are not her husband?I
should think it would be a jolly sight more agitating to believe one's
self bound to a perfect stranger.It is a wonder it has not driven the
poor child crazy.""Luckily she took the sad news very calmly," Cyril could not refrain
from remarking.Really, Guy was intolerable and he longed with a
primitive longing to punch his head.Guy
was capable of being nasty, if not handled carefully.So he hastily
continued:

"How can you undeceive her on one point without explaining the whole
situation to her?""I--" began Guy, "I--" He paused.Even you have to
acknowledge that the relief of knowing that she is not my wife might be
offset by learning not only that we are quite in the dark as to who she
is, but that at any moment she may be arrested on a charge of murder."And leave you to insinuate yourself
into her--affections!She must be told the truth some day, but by that
time she may have grown to--to--love you."That fact evidently seems 'too trifling'
to be considered, but I fancy she will not regard it as casually as you
do.""This is absurd," began Cyril, but Guy intercepted him."You feel free to do as you please because you expect to get a divorce,
but you have not got it yet, remember, and in the meantime your wife may
bring a countersuit, naming Miss--Mrs."And in that case," continued Campbell, "she would probably think that
she ought to marry you.After having been dragged through the filth of a
divorce court, she would imagine herself too besmirched to give herself
to any other man.And your wealth, your title, and your precious self
may not seem to her as desirable as you suppose.She is the sort of girl
who would think them a poor exchange for the loss of her reputation and
her liberty of choice.When she discovers how you have compromised her
by your asinine stupidity, I don't fancy that she will take a lenient
view of your conduct.""You seem to forget that if I had not shielded her with my name, she
would undoubtedly have been arrested on the train.""Oh, I don't doubt you meant well.""Thanks," murmured Cyril sarcastically."All I say is that you must not see her again till this mystery is
cleared up.I didn't forget about the number of her apartment, but I
wasn't going to help you to sneak in to her at all hours.Now, if you
want to see her, you will have to go boldly up to the hotel and have
yourself properly announced.And I don't think you will care about
that.""I don't care a fig for your promises.You shan't see her as long as she
believes you to be her husband."Luckily the room was empty, for both men had risen to their feet."I shall see her," repeated Cyril."If you do, I warn you that I shall tell her the truth and risk the
consequences.She shall not, if I can help it, be placed in a position
where she will be forced to marry a man who has, after all, lived his
life."She ought, in other words, to be given the choice between my battered
heart and your virgin affections."I mean----"

"Oh, you have made your meaning quite clear, I assure you!""But what you have been saying is sheer nonsense.You have been
calling me to account for things that have not happened, and blaming me
for what I have not done.She is not being dragged through the divorce
court, and I see no reason to suppose that she ever will be.I am not
trying to force her to marry me, and can promise that I shall never do
so.Far from taking advantage of the situation, I assure you my conduct
has been most circumspect.Don't cross a bridge till you get to it, and
don't accuse a man of being a cad just because--" Cyril paused abruptly
and looked at Guy, and as he did so, his expression slowly relaxed till
he finally smiled indulgently--"just because a certain lady is very
charming," he added.He would neither retract nor modify his
ultimatum.He knew, of course, that Cyril would not dare to write the
girl; for if the letter miscarried or was found by the police, it might
be fatal to both.But while they were still heatedly debating the question, a way suddenly
occurred to Cyril by which he could communicate with her with absolute
safety.So he waited placidly for Guy to take himself off, which he
eventually did, visibly elated at having, as he thought, effectually put
a stop to further intercourse between the two.He had hardly left the
club, however, before Cyril was talking to Priscilla over the telephone!He explained to her as best he could that he had been called out of town
for a few days, and begged her on no account to leave her apartments
till he returned.He also tried to impress on her that she had better
talk about him as little as possible and above all things not to mention
either to Campbell or Miss Trevor that she had heard from him and
expected to see him before long.It cost Cyril a tremendous effort to restrict himself to necessary
instructions and polite inquiries, especially as she kept begging him to
come back to her as soon as possible.Finally he could bear the strain
no longer, and in the middle of a sentence he resolutely hung up the
receiver.CHAPTER XIV

WHAT IS THE TRUTH?When Cyril arrived in Newhaven that evening, he was unpleasantly
surprised to find, as he got out of the train, that Judson had been
travelling in the adjoining compartment.Had the man been following him,
or was it simply chance that had brought them together, he wondered.If he could only get rid of the fellow!"You have come to see me, I suppose," he remarked ungraciously."Very well, then, get into the car."Cyril was in no mood to talk, so the first part of the way was
accomplished in silence, but at last, thinking that he might as well
hear what the man had to say, he turned to him and asked:

"Have you found out anything of any importance?""If you will excuse me, my lord, I should suggest that we wait till we
get to the castle," replied Judson, casting a meaning look at the
chauffeur's back.His contempt for Judson was so great that Cyril
was not very curious to hear his revelations."Now," said Cyril, as he flung himself into a low chair before the
library fire, "what have you to tell me?"Before answering Judson peered cautiously around; then, drawing forward
a straight-backed chair, he seated himself close to Cyril and folded his
hands in his lap."In dealing with my clients," he began, "I make it a rule instead of
simply stating the results of my work to show them how I arrive at my
conclusions.Having submitted to them all the facts I have collected,
they are able to judge for themselves as to the value of the evidence on
which my deductions are based.And so, my lord, I should like to go over
the whole case with you from the very beginning."Cyril gave a grunt which Judson evidently construed into an assent, for
he continued even more glibly:

"The first point I considered was, whether her Ladyship had premeditated
her escape.But in order to determine this, we must first decide whom
she could have got to help her to accomplish such a purpose.The most
careful inquiry has failed to reveal any one who would have been both
willing and able to do so, except the sempstress, and as both mistress
and maid disappeared almost simultaneously, one's first impulse is to
take it for granted that Prentice was her Ladyship's accomplice.This is
what every one, Scotland Yard included, believes.""Before either accepting or rejecting this theory, I decided to visit
this girl's home.I did not feel clear in my mind about her.All the
servants were impressed by her manner and personality, the butler
especially so, and he more than hinted that there must be some mystery
attached to her.One of the things that stimulated their curiosity was
that she kept up a daily correspondence with some one in Plumtree.On
reaching the village I called at once on the vicar.He is an elderly
man, much respected and beloved by his parishioners.I found him in a
state of great excitement, having just read in the paper of Prentice's
disappearance.I had no difficulty in inducing him to tell me the main
facts of her history; the rest I picked up from the village gossips.And till she came to Geralton she was an inmate of
the vicar's household.He told me that he would have adopted her, but
knowing that he had not sufficient means to provide for her future, he
wisely refrained from educating her above her station.Nevertheless, I
gathered that the privilege of his frequent companionship had refined
her speech and manners, and I am told that she now could pass muster in
any drawing-room.""Not that I know of, and I do not believe the vicar would have taught
her an accomplishment so useless to one in her position.""No matter--I--but go on with your story.""Owing partly to the mystery which surrounded her birth and gave rise to
all sorts of rumours, and partly to her own personality, the gentry of
the neighbourhood made quite a pet of her.As a child she was asked
occasionally to play with the Squire's crippled daughter and later she
used to go to the Hall three times a week to read aloud to her.So,
notwithstanding the vicar's good intentions, she grew up to be neither
'fish, flesh, fowl, nor good red herring.'Now all went well till about
a year ago, when the Squire's eldest son returned home and fell in love
with her.His people naturally opposed the match and, as he is entirely
dependent upon them, there seemed no possibility of his marrying her.The girl appeared broken-hearted, and when she came to the castle, every
one, the vicar included, thought the affair at an end.I am sure,
however, that such was not the case, for as no one at the vicarage wrote
to her daily, the letters she received must have come from her young
man.Furthermore, she told the servants that she had a cousin in
Newhaven, but as she has not a relative in the world, this is obviously
a falsehood.Who, then, is this mysterious person she visited?It seems
to me almost certain that it was her lover.""But I don't quite see what you are trying to
prove by all this.If Prentice did not help her Ladyship to escape, who
did?""I have not said that Prentice is not a factor in the case, only I
believe her part to have been a very subordinate one.Of one thing,
however, I am sure, and that is that she did not return to Geralton on
the night of the murder.""Because she asked for permission early in the morning to spend the
night in Newhaven and had already left the castle before the doctors'
visit terminated.Now, although I think it probable that her Ladyship
may for a long time have entertained the idea of leaving Geralton, yet I
believe that it was the doctors' visit that gave the necessary impetus
to convert her idle longing into definite action.Therefore I conclude
that Prentice could have had no knowledge of her mistress's sudden
flight.""But how can you know that the whole thing had not been carefully
premeditated?""Because her Ladyship showed such agitation and distress at hearing the
doctors' verdict.If her plans for leaving the castle had been
completed, she would have accepted the situation more calmly."We have been able to trace them only as far as London.They
could not have been reputable physicians or they would have answered our
advertisements, and so I am inclined to believe that you were right and
that it was his Lordship who spread the rumours of her Ladyship's
insanity.""I am sure of it," said Cyril.Assuming, therefore, that Lady Wilmersley is sane, we will
proceed to draw logical inferences from her actions."Judson paused a
moment before continuing: "Now I am convinced that the only connection
Prentice had with the affair was to procure some clothes for her
mistress, and these had probably been sometime in the latter's
possession.""I think it would have been pretty
difficult to have concealed anything from that maid of hers.""Difficult, I grant you, but not impossible, my lord.""But if Prentice had no knowledge of the tragedy, why did she not return
to the castle?Why have the police been unable
to find her?""I believe that she joined her lover and that they are together on the
continent, for in Plumtree I was told that the young man had recently
gone to Paris.As I am sure that she knows nothing of any importance, I
thought it useless to waste time and money trying to discover their
exact locality.That the police have not succeeded in finding her, I
ascribe to the fact that they are looking for a young woman who left
Newhaven after and not before the murder.""Yes, and I have two reasons for this supposition.First, I can discover
no place where he or she, either separately or together, could have
spent the night.Secondly, if they had left Newhaven the following
morning or in fact at any time after the murder, they would certainly
have been apprehended, as all the boats and trains were most carefully
watched.""But no one knew of her disappearance till twenty-four hours later, and
during that interval she could easily have got away unobserved.""No, my lord, there you are mistaken.From the moment that the police
were notified that a crime had been committed, every one, especially
every woman, who left Newhaven was most attentively scrutinised.""You are certain that Prentice could not have left Newhaven unnoticed,
yet her Ladyship managed to do so!The detective paused a moment and looked fixedly at Cyril."Her Ladyship had a very powerful protector, my lord," he finally said."It's no use beating about the bush, my lord, I know everything.""Well then, out with it," cried Cyril impatiently.Have you found her Ladyship or have you not?"Then why on earth didn't you tell me at once?There was a pause during which the detective regarded Cyril through
narrowed lids."She is at present at the nursing home of Dr.Stuart-Smith," he said at
last.exclaimed Cyril, sinking back into his chair and negligently
lighting another cigarette.You
mean my wife, Lady Wilmersley----"

"Pardon me for interrupting you, my lord.I repeat, the Dowager Lady Wilmersley is under the care of Dr.The man's tone was so assured that Cyril was staggered for a moment."It isn't true," he asserted angrily."Is it possible that you really do not know who the lady is that you
rescued that day from the police?"exclaimed the detective, startled out
of his habitual impassivity.But of one thing I am sure, and that is that
she is not the person you suppose.""Well, my lord, I must say that you have surprised me."I tell you that you are on the wrong track."She has not, for it has turned completely white," exclaimed Cyril,
triumphantly."Her Ladyship is cleverer than I supposed," remarked the detective with
a pitying smile."I am not such a fool as you seem to think," retorted Cyril."And I can
assure you that the lady in question is incapable of deception.""All I can say is, my lord, that I am absolutely sure of her Ladyship's
identity and that you yourself gave me the clue to her whereabouts.""I of course noticed that when you heard her Ladyship had golden hair,
you were not only extremely surprised but also very much relieved.I at
once asked myself why such an apparently trivial matter should have so
great and so peculiar an effect on you.As you had never seen her
Ladyship, I argued that you must that very day have met some one you had
reason to suppose to be Lady Wilmersley and that this person had dark
hair.By following your movements from the time you landed I found that
the only woman with whom you had come in contact was a young lady who
had joined you in Newhaven, and that she answered to the description of
Lady Wilmersley in every particular, with the sole exception that she
had dark hair!I was, however, told that you had said that she was your
wife and had produced a passport to prove it.Now I had heard from your
valet that her Ladyship was still in France, so you can hardly blame me
for doubting the correctness of your statement.But in order to make
assurance doubly sure, I sent one of my men to the continent.He
reported that her Ladyship had for some months been a patient at
Charleroi, but had recently escaped from there, and that you are still
employing detectives to find her.""I did not engage you to pry into my affairs," exclaimed Cyril savagely."Nor have I exceeded my duty as I conceive it," retorted the detective."As your Lordship refused to honour me with your confidence, I had to
find out the facts by other means; and you must surely realise that
without facts it is impossible for me to construct a theory, and till I
can do that my work is practically valueless.""But my wife has nothing to do with the case.""Quite so, my lord, but a lady who claimed to be her Ladyship is
intimately concerned with it.""If your Lordship will listen to me, I think I can prove to you that as
far as the lady's identity is concerned, I have made no mistake.But to
do this convincingly, I must reconstruct the tragedy as I conceive that
it happened.""Go ahead; I don't mind hearing your theory.""First, I must ask you to take it for granted that I am right in
believing that Prentice was ignorant of her Ladyship's flight.""I will admit that much," agreed Cyril.Now let us try and imagine exactly what was her
Ladyship's position on the night of the murder.Her first care must have
been to devise some means of eluding his Lordship's vigilance.This was
a difficult problem, for Mustapha tells me that his Lordship was not
only a very light sleeper but that he suffered from chronic insomnia.You may or may not know that his Lordship had long been addicted to the
opium habit and would sometimes for days together lie in a stupor.Large
quantities of the drug were found in his room and that explains how her
Ladyship managed to get hold of the opium with which she doctored his
Lordship's coffee.""This is, however, mere supposition on your part," objected Cyril.I had the sediment of the two cups analysed and
the chemist found that one of them contained a small quantity of opium.Her Ladyship, being practically ignorant as to the exact nature of the
drug and of the effect it would have on a man who was saturated with it,
gave his Lordship too small a dose.Nevertheless, he became immediately
stupefied.""Now, how on earth can you know that?"If his Lordship had not been rendered at once
unconscious, he would--knowing that an attempt had been made to drug
him--have sounded the alarm and deputed Mustapha to guard her Ladyship,
which was what he always did when he knew that he was not equal to the
task.""Well, that sounds plausible, at all events," acknowledged Cyril."As soon as her Ladyship knew that she was no longer watched," continued
the detective, "she at once set to work to disguise herself.As we know,
she had provided herself with clothes, but I fancy her hair, her most
noticeable feature, must have caused her some anxious moments.""She may have worn a wig," suggested Cyril, hoping that Judson would
accept this explanation of the difficulty, in which case he would be
able triumphantly to demolish the latter's theory of the girl's
identity, by stating that he could positively swear that her hair was
her own.After carefully investigating the matter I have come to
the conclusion that she did not.And my reasons are, first, that no
hairdresser in Newhaven has lately sold a dark wig to any one, and,
secondly, that no parcel arrived, addressed either to her Ladyship or to
Prentice, which could have contained such an article.On the other hand,
as his Lordship had for years dyed his hair and beard, her Ladyship had
only to go into his dressing-room to procure a very simple means of
transforming herself.""But doesn't it take ages to dye hair?""If it is done properly, yes; but the sort of stain his Lordship used
can be very quickly applied.I do not believe it took her Ladyship more
than half an hour to dye enough of her hair to escape notice, but in all
probability she had no time to do it very thoroughly and that which
escaped may have turned white.This was a possibility which had not occurred to Cyril; but still he
refused to be convinced.Let me continue my story: Before her Ladyship had
completed her preparations, his Lordship awoke from his stupor.""Because, if his Lordship had not tried to prevent her escape, she would
have had no reason for killing him.Probably they had a struggle, her
hand fell on the pistol, and the deed was done----"

"But what about the ruined picture?""Her Ladyship, knowing that there was no other portrait of her in
existence, destroyed it in order to make it difficult for the police to
follow her.""You make her Ladyship out a nice, cold-blooded,
calculating sort of person.If you think she at all resembles the young
lady at the nursing home, I can only tell you that you are vastly
mistaken.""As I have not the honour of knowing the lady in question, I cannot form
any opinion as to that.But let us continue: I wish to confess at once
that I am not at all sure how her Ladyship reached Newhaven.On the face of it, it seems as
if it must have some connection with the case.I have also a feeling
that it has, and yet for the life of me I cannot discover the connecting
link.Whatever the younger man was, the elder was undoubtedly a
Frenchman, and I have ascertained that with the exception of an old
French governess, who lived with her Ladyship before her marriage, and
of Mustapha and Valdriguez, Lady Wilmersley knew no foreigner whatever.Besides, these two men seem to have been motoring about the country
almost at random, and it may have been the merest accident which brought
them to the foot of the long lane just at the time when her Ladyship was
in all probability leaving the castle.Whether they gave her a lift as
far as Newhaven, I do not know.How her Ladyship reached the town
constitutes the only serious--I will not call it break--but hiatus--in
my theory.From half-past six the next morning, however, her movements
can be easily followed.A young lady, dressed as you know, approached
the station with obvious nervousness.Three things attracted the
attention of the officials: first, the discrepancy between the
simplicity, I might almost say the poverty, of her clothes, and the fact
that she purchased a first-class ticket; secondly, that she did not wish
her features to be seen; and thirdly, that she had no luggage except a
small hand-bag.How her Ladyship managed to elude the police, and what
has subsequently occurred to her, I do not need to tell your Lordship.""You haven't in the least convinced me that the young lady is her
Ladyship, not in the least.You yourself admit that there is a hiatus in
your story; well, that hiatus is to me a gulf which you have failed to
bridge.Because one lady disappears from Geralton and another appears
the next morning in Newhaven, you insist the two are identical.But you
have not offered me one iota of proof that such is the case."She is the only person who left Newhaven
by train or boat who even vaguely resembled her Ladyship."Her Ladyship may not have come to Newhaven at all,
but have been driven to some hiding-place in the Frenchman's car.""I think that quite impossible, for every house, every cottage, every
stable and barn even, for twenty-five miles around, has been carefully
searched.Besides, this would mean that the murder had been premeditated
and the coming of the motor had been pre-arranged; and lastly, as the
gardener's wife testifies that the car left Geralton certainly no
earlier than eleven-thirty, and as the two men reached the hotel before
twelve, this precludes the possibility that they could have done more
than drive straight back to the Inn, as the motor is by no means a fast
one.""But, my man, they may have secreted her Ladyship in the town itself and
have taken her with them to France the next morning."In the first place, they left alone, the porter saw them
off; and secondly, no one except the two Frenchmen purchased a ticket
for the continent either in the Newhaven office or on the boat."Judson's logic was horribly convincing; no
smallest detail had apparently escaped him.As the man piled argument on
argument, he had found himself slowly and grudgingly accepting his
conclusions."As you are in my employ, I take it for granted that you will not inform
the police or the press of your--suspicions," he said at last.On the other hand, I must ask you to allow me
to withdraw from the case.""Because my duty to you, as my client, prevents me from taking any
further steps in this matter.""I gather that you are less anxious to clear up the mystery than to
protect her Ladyship."You would even wish me to assist you in providing a safe retreat for
her.""Well, my lord, that is just what I cannot do.It is my duty, as I
conceive it, to hold my tongue, but I should not feel justified in
aiding her Ladyship to escape the consequences of her--her--action.In
order to be faithful to my engagement to you, I am willing to let the
public believe that I have made a failure of the case.I shall not even
allow my imagination to dwell on your future movements, but more than
that I cannot do.""You take the position that her Ladyship is an ordinary criminal, but
you must realise that that is absurd.Even granting that she is
responsible for her husband's death--of which, by the way, we have no
absolute proof--are you not able to make allowances for a poor woman
goaded to desperation by an opium fiend?""I do not constitute myself her Ladyship's judge, but I don't think your
Lordship quite realises all that you are asking of me.Even if I were
willing to waive the question of my professional honour, I should still
decline to undertake a task which, I know, is foredoomed to failure.For, if _I_ discovered Lady Wilmersley with so little difficulty,
Scotland Yard is bound to do so before long.It is impossible--absolutely impossible, I assure you,
that the secret can be kept.""I wish I could convince your Lordship of this and induce you to allow
the law to take its course.Her Ladyship ought to come forward at once
and plead justifiable homicide.If she waits till she is arrested, it
will tell heavily against her.""But she is ill, really ill," insisted Cyril.Stuart-Smith tells me
that if she is not kept perfectly quiet for the next few weeks, her
nervous system may never recover from the shock."That certainly complicates the situation; on the other hand, you
must remember that discovery is not only inevitable but imminent, and
that the police will not stop to consider her Ladyship's nervous system.No, my lord, the only thing for you to do is to break the news to her
yourself and to persuade her to give herself up.If you don't, you will
both live to regret it.""That may be so," replied Cyril after a minute's hesitation, "but in
this matter I must judge for myself.I still hope that you are wrong and
that either the young woman in question is not Lady Wilmersley or that
it was not her Ladyship who killed my cousin, and I refuse to jeopardise
her life till I am sure that there is no possibility of your having made
a mistake.So far you have only sought
for evidence which would strengthen your theory of her Ladyship's guilt,
now I want you to look at the case from a fresh point of view.I want
you to start all over again and to work on the assumption that her
Ladyship did not fire the shot.I cannot accept your conclusion as final
till we have exhausted every other possibility.These Frenchmen, for
instance, have they or have they not a connection with the case?At the
inquest she acknowledged that no one had seen her leave her Ladyship's
apartments and we have only her word for it that she spent the evening
in her room."But, if I went on the principle of suspecting every one who
cannot prove themselves innocent, I should soon be lost in a quagmire of
barren conjectures.Of course, I have considered Valdriguez, but I can
find no reason for suspecting her.""Well, I could give you a dozen reasons.""Indeed, my lord, and what are they?""In the first place, we know that she is a hard, unprincipled woman, or
she would never have consented to aid my cousin in depriving his
unfortunate wife of her liberty.A woman who would do that, is capable
of any villainy.Then, on the witness-stand didn't you feel that she was
holding something back?Oh, I forgot you were not present at the
inquest.""I was there, my lord, but I took good care that no one should recognise
me.""Well, and what impression did she make on you?"I think she spoke the truth and I
fancy that she is almost a religious fanatic.""You don't mean to say, Judson, that you allowed yourself to be taken in
by her sanctimonious airs and the theatrical way that she kept clutching
at that cross on her breast?Why, don't you
see that no woman with a spark of religion in her could have allowed her
mistress to be treated as Lady Wilmersley was?""Quite so, my lord, and it is because Valdriguez impressed me as an
honest old creature that I am still doubtful whether her Ladyship is
insane or not, and this uncertainty hampers me very much in my work.""Lady Upton assured me that her granddaughter's mind had never been
unbalanced and that his Lordship, although he frequently wrote to her,
had never so much as hinted at such a thing; and if you believe the
young lady at the nursing home to be Lady Wilmersley, I give you my word
that she shows no sign of mental derangement.""Well, that seems pretty final, and yet--and yet--I cannot believe that
Valdriguez is a vicious woman.A man in my profession acquires a curious
instinct in such matters, my lord."The detective paused a moment and
when he began again, he spoke almost as if he were reasoning with
himself."Now, if my estimate of Valdriguez is correct, and if it is
also a fact that Lady Wilmersley has never been insane, there are
certainly possibilities connected with this affair which I have by no
means exhausted--and so, my lord, I am not only willing but anxious to
continue on the case, if you will agree to allow me to ignore her
Ladyship's existence."But tell me, Judson, how can you hope to reconcile two such
absolutely contradictory facts?""Two such apparently contradictory facts," gently corrected the
detective."Well, my lord, I propose to find out more of this woman's
antecedents.I have several times tried to get her to talk, but so far
without the least success.She says that she will answer any question
put to her on the witness-stand, but that it is against her principles
to gossip about her late master and mistress.She is equally reticent as
to her past life and when I told her that her silence seemed to me very
suspicious, she demanded--suspicious of what?She went on to say that
she could not see that it was anybody's business, where she lived or
what she had done, and that she had certainly no intention of gratifying
my idle curiosity; and that was the last word I could get out of her.Although she treated me so cavalierly, I confess to a good deal of
sympathy with her attitude.""She was
housekeeper here when Valdriguez first came to Geralton and ought to be
able to tell you what sort of person she was in her youth."The only thing she told me which may
have a bearing on the case is, that in the old days his Lordship
appeared to admire Valdriguez very much.""But we cannot be too sure of this, my lord.For when I tried to find
out what grounds she had for her statement, she had so little proof to
offer that I cannot accept her impression as conclusive evidence.As far
as I can make out, the gossip about them was started by his Lordship
going to the Catholic church in Newhaven."Not a very compromising act on his Lordship's part, one would
think.But as his Lordship was not a Catholic, his doing so naturally
aroused a good deal of comment.At first the neighbourhood feared that
he had been converted by his mother, who had often lamented that she had
not been allowed to bring up her son in her own faith.It was soon
noticed, however, that whenever his Lordship attended a popish service,
his mother's pretty maid was invariably present, and so people began to
put two and two together and before long it was universally assumed that
she was the magnet which had drawn him away from his own church.Eversley if they had been seen together elsewhere, and she
reluctantly admitted that they had.On several occasions they were seen
walking in the Park but always, so Mrs.Eversley assured me, in full
view of the castle.She had felt it her duty to speak to Valdriguez on
the subject, and the latter told her that his Lordship was interested in
her religion and that she was willing to run the risk of having her
conduct misconstrued if she could save his soul from eternal damnation.Eversley to understand that she had her mistress's
sanction, and as her Ladyship treated Valdriguez more as a companion and
friend than as a maid, Mrs.Eversley thought this quite likely and did
not venture to remonstrate further.So the intimacy, if such it could be
called, continued as before.What the outcome of this state of things
would have been we do not know, for shortly afterwards both Lord and
Lady Wilmersley died and Valdriguez left Geralton.When his Lordship
went away a few weeks later, a good many people suspected that he had
joined her on the continent.Eversley, however, does not believe
this.She has the most absolute confidence in Valdriguez's virtue, and I
think her testimony is pretty reliable."Eversley is an honest, simple old soul.A clever adventuress
would have little difficulty in hoodwinking her.Mark my words, you have
found the key to the mystery.What more likely than that his
Lordship--whose morals, even as a boy, were none of the best--seduced
Valdriguez and that she returned to Geralton so as to have the
opportunity of avenging her wrongs.""I can think of nothing more unlikely than that his Lordship should have
selected his cast-off mistress as his wife's attendant," Judson drily
remarked.You didn't know him," replied Cyril."I can quite fancy
that the situation would have appealed to his cynical humour.""Your opinion of the late Lord Wilmersley is certainly not flattering,
but even if we take for granted that such an arrangement would not have
been impossible to his Lordship, I still refuse to believe that
Valdriguez would have agreed to it; even assuming that his Lordship had
wronged her and that she had nursed a murderous resentment against him
all these years, I cannot see how she could have hoped to further her
object by accepting the humiliating position of his wife's maid.It also
seems to me incredible that a woman whose passions were so violent as to
find expression in murder could have controlled them during a lifetime.But leaving aside these considerations, I have another reason to urge
against your theory: Would his Lordship have trusted a woman who, he
knew, had a grievance against him, as he certainly trusted Valdriguez?What was there to have prevented
her from giving him an overdose of some drug during one of the many
times when he was half-stupefied with opium?The risk of
detection would have been infinitesimal.No, my lord, why Valdriguez
returned to Geralton is an enigma, I grant you, but your explanation
does not satisfy me.""As long as you acknowledge that Valdriguez's presence here needs an
explanation and are willing to work to find that explanation, I don't
care whether you accept my theory or not; all I want to get at is the
truth.""The truth, my lord," said the detective, as he rose to take his leave,
"is often more praised than appreciated."CHAPTER XV

FINGER PRINTS IN THE DUST


As Cyril sat toying with his dinner, it was little by little borne in on
him that the butler had something on his mind.How he got this
impression he really did not know, for Douglas performed his duties as
precisely, as unobtrusively as ever.Yet long before the last course had
been reached, Cyril was morally certain that he had not been mistaken.He waited for the dessert to be placed on the table; then, having
motioned the footmen to leave the room, he half turned to the butler,
who was standing behind his chair.The man stepped forward, so as to face his master.asked Cyril, scrutinising the other
attentively.The abrupt question seemed neither to surprise nor to discompose the
butler; yet he hesitated before finally answering:

"I--I don't quite know, my lord.""You must know whether or not
something has happened to upset you.""Well, my lord--it's this way, my lord--Susan, the upper 'ousemaid, says
as how there has been somebody or--" here his voice sank to a whisper
and he cast an apprehensive glance over his shoulder--"or something in
the library last night!"Cyril put down the glass of wine he was carrying to his lips untasted."She thinks she saw a ghost in the library?"She didn't see anything, but this morning she found
finger-marks on the top of his Lordship's desk."One of the servants may have gone in there out of
curiosity.""But what would anybody be doing there in the night, I should like to
know?And Susan says those marks could only 'ave been made last night,
my lord.""On account of the dust, my lord.It takes time for dust to settle and a
'ousemaid, who knows 'er business, can tell, after she's been in a place
a couple of months, just about 'ow long it's been since any particular
piece of furniture has been dusted.No young
'ousemaid can pull the wool over 'er eyes, I can tell you.""Does every one know of Susan's suspicions?"Susan's a sensible woman, and though she was frightened
something terrible, she only told Mrs.Eversley told
me and we three agreed we'd hold our tongues.Every one's that upset as
it is, that they'd all 'ave 'ighstrikes if they knew that It was
walking."But even
if there were such things, an intangible spirit couldn't possibly leave
finger-marks behind it.""But, my lord, if you'll excuse me, my aunt's cousin--" began the
butler, but Cyril cut him short."I have no time now to hear about your aunt's cousin, though no doubt it
is a most interesting story.Susan had, however, no further information to impart.She was positive
that the marks must have been made some time during the night."And it's my belief they were made by a skeleton hand," she added."And
as for going into that room again, indeed I just couldn't, not for
nobody, meaning no disrespect to your Lordship; and as for the other
'ousemaids, they'll not go near the place either and haven't been since
the murder.""Very well, Susan, I shall not ask you to do so.Those rooms shall not
be opened again till this mystery is cleared up.I will go now and lock
them up myself."Striding rapidly across the hall, Cyril opened the door of the library.This part of the castle had been equipped with electric light and steam
heat, and as he stepped into the darkness, the heavy-scented air almost
made him reel.Having found the switch, he noticed at once that the room
had indefinably changed since he had been in it last.Notwithstanding
the heat, notwithstanding the flood of crimson light, which permeated
even the farthest corners, it had already assumed the chill, gloomy
aspect of an abandoned apartment.Stooping over the desk, he eagerly inspected the marks which had so
startled the housemaid.Yes, they were still quite visible, although a
delicate film of dust had already begun to soften the precision of their
outline--very strange!They certainly did look like the imprint of
skeleton fingers.His fingers left a
mark at least twice as wide as those of the mysterious visitant.For a long time he stood with bent head pondering deeply; then, throwing
back his shoulders, as if he had arrived at some decision, he proceeded
to explore the entire suite.Having satisfied himself that no one was
secreted on the premises, he turned off the light, shut the door--but he
did not turn the key.Some hours later Cyril, in his great four-posted bed, lay watching, with
wide-open eyes, the fantastic shadows thrown by the dancing firelight on
the panelled walls.To woo sleep was evidently not his intention, for
from time to time he lighted a wax vesta and consulted the watch he held
in his hand.At last the hour seemed to satisfy him, for he got out of
bed and made a hasty toilet.Having accomplished this as best he could
in the semi-obscurity, he slipped a pistol into his pocket and left his
room.Groping his way through the darkness, he descended the stairs and
cautiously traversed the hall.His stockinged
feet moved noiselessly over the heavy carpet.At the door of the library
he paused a moment and listened intently; then, pistol in hand, he threw
open the door.Closing the
door behind him, he lighted a match and carefully inspected the desk.Having assured himself that no fresh marks had appeared on its polished
surface, he blew out the match and ensconced himself as comfortably as
the limited space permitted behind the curtains of one of the windows.There he waited patiently for what seemed to him an eternity.He had
just begun to fear that his vigil would prove fruitless, when his ear
was gladdened by a slight sound.A moment later the light was switched
on.Hardly daring to breathe, Cyril peered through the curtains.Cyril's heart gave a bound of exultation.Had he not guessed
that those marks could only have been made by her small, bony fingers?Clad like a nun in a loose, black garment, which fell in straight,
austere folds to her feet; a black shawl, thrown over her head, casting
strange shadows on her pale, haggard face, she advanced slowly, almost
majestically, into the room.Cyril had to acknowledge that she looked
more like a medieval saint than a midnight marauder.Evidently the woman had no fear of detection, for she never even cast
one suspicious glance around her; nor did she appear to feel that there
was any necessity for haste, for she lingered for some time near the
writing-table, gazing at it, as if it had a fascination for her; but,
finally, she turned away with a hopeless sigh and directed her attention
to the bookcase.This she proceeded to examine in the most methodical
manner.Book after book was taken down, shaken, and the binding
carefully scrutinised.Having cleared a shelf, she drew a tape measure
from her pocket and rapped and measured the back and sides of the case
itself.What on earth could she be looking for, wondered Cyril.For his cousin's will, executed at the date of his marriage, had
been found safely deposited with his solicitor.One in which she hoped that her master had remembered her, as he had
probably promised her that he would?Well, there was no further need of concealment, he decided, so, parting
the curtains, he stepped into the room.His own voice startled him, it rang out so loud and harsh in the silence
of the night.Valdriguez knelt on the floor with her back to him, and it seemed as if
the sudden shock had paralysed her, for she made no effort to move, and
her hand, arrested in the act of replacing a book, remained
outstretched, as if it had been turned to stone.He saw her shudder convulsively, then slowly she raised her head, and as
her great, tragic eyes met his, Cyril was conscious of a revulsion of
feeling toward her.Never had he seen anything so hopeless yet so
undaunted as the look she gave him.It reminded him, curiously enough,
of a look he had once seen in the eyes of a lioness, who, with a bullet
through her heart, still fought to protect her young.Staggering a little as she rose, Valdriguez nevertheless managed to draw
herself up to her full height."I am here, my lord, to get what is mine--mine," she repeated almost
fiercely.It was absurd, he reasoned, to allow
himself to be impressed by her strange personality.he exclaimed; and the very fact that he was more than
half-inclined to believe her, made him speak more roughly than he would
otherwise have done."Think what you like," she cried, shrugging her shoulders
contemptuously."Have me arrested--have me hung--what do I care?"So you confess that it was you who murdered his Lordship?Your sanctimonious airs didn't deceive me," exclaimed
Cyril triumphantly."No, I did not murder him," she replied calmly, almost indifferently."I think you will have some difficulty convincing the police of that.You have no alibi to prove that you were not in these rooms at the time
of the murder, and now when I tell them that I found you trying to
steal----"

"I am no thief," she interrupted him with blazing eyes."I tell you, I
came here to get what is mine by right.""Do you really expect me to believe that?Even if what you say were
true, you would not have had to sneak in here in the middle of the
night.You know very well that I should have made no objections to your
claiming your own."But if I had gone to you and told you that a great lord had
robbed me, a poor woman, of something which is dearer to me than life
itself, would you have believed me?If I had said to you, 'I must look
through his Lordship's papers; I must be free to search everywhere,'
would you have given me permission to do so?That it was because I was ashamed of my errand that I came here at
this hour?All I feared was that I should be prevented from
discovering the truth.Valdriguez's voice suddenly dropped
and she seemed to forget Cyril's presence.She
continued speaking as if to herself and her wild eyes swept feverishly
around the room."He told me it was here--and yet how can I be sure of
it?He may have lied to me about this as he did about everything else.I cannot bear it any
longer, oh, my God!"she cried, clasping her hands and lifting her
streaming eyes to heaven, "Thou knowest that I have striven all my life
to do Thy will; I have borne the cross that Thou sawest fit to lay upon
me without a murmur, nor have I once begged for mercy at Thy hands; but
now, now, oh, my Father, I beseech thee, give me to know the truth
before I die----"

Cyril watched the woman narrowly.He felt that he must try and maintain
a judicial attitude toward her and not allow himself to be led astray by
his sympathies which, as he knew to his cost, were only too easily
aroused.After all, he reasoned, was it not more than likely that she
was delivering this melodramatic tirade for his benefit?On the other
hand, it was against his principles as well as against his inclinations
to deal harshly with a woman."Calm yourself, Valdriguez," he said at last."If you can convince me
that his Lordship had in his possession something which rightfully
belonged to you, I promise that, if it can be found, it shall be
restored to you.Tell me, what it is that you are looking for?"You promise--so did he--the
smooth-tongued villain!Never
will I trust one of his race again.""You have got to trust me whether you want to or not.Your position
could not be worse than it is, could it?Don't you see that your only
hope lies in being able to persuade me that you are an honest woman?"For the first time Valdriguez looked at Cyril attentively.He felt as if
her great eyes were probing his very soul."Indeed, you do not look cruel or deceitful.And, as you say, I am
powerless without you, so I must take the risk of your being what you
seem.But first, my lord, will you swear not
to betray my secret to any living being?"That is--" he hastily added, "if it has
nothing to do with the murder."CHAPTER XVI

THE STORY OF A WRONG


Cyril waited for her to continue, but for a long time it seemed doubtful
if she would have the courage to do so."I am looking," she said at last, speaking slowly and with a visible
effort, "for a paper which will tell me whether my--son is alive or
dead."So you were his Lordship's mistress----"

"Before God I was his wife!"The old story--" began Cyril, but Valdriguez stopped him with a furious
gesture."Do not dare to say that my child's mother was a loose woman!Arthur Wilmersley--may his Maker judge him as he
deserves--wrecked my life, but at least he never doubted my virtue.He
knew that the only way to get me was to marry me.""No--but for a long time I believed that he had.How could a young,
innocent girl have suspected that the man she loved was capable of such
cold-blooded deception?Even now, I cannot blame myself for having
fallen into the trap he baited with such fiendish cunning.Think of
it--he induced me to consent to a secret marriage by promising that if I
made this sacrifice for his sake, he would become a convert to my
religion--my religion!And as we stood together before the altar, I
remember that I thanked God for giving me this opportunity of saving a
soul from destruction.I never dreamed that the church he took me to was
nothing but an old ruin he had fitted up as a chapel for the occasion.How could I guess that the man who married us was not a priest but a
mountebank, whom he had hired to act the part?"Valdriguez bowed her head and the tears trickled through her thin
fingers."I know that not many people would believe you but, well--I do."It
seemed to Cyril as if the words sprang to his lips unbidden."Then indeed you are a good man," exclaimed Valdriguez, "for it is given
only to honest people to have a sure ear for the truth.Now it will be
easier to tell you the rest.Some weeks after we had gone through this
ceremony, first Lord and then Lady Wilmersley died; on her deathbed I
confided to my lady that I was her son's wife and she gave me her
blessing.My humble birth she forgave--after all it was less humble than
her own--and was content that her son had chosen a girl of her own race
and faith.As soon as the funeral was over, I urged my husband to
announce our marriage, but he would not.He proposed that we should go
for a while to the continent so that on our return it would be taken for
granted that we had been married there, and in this way much unpleasant
talk avoided.So we went to Paris and there we lived together openly as
man and wife, not indeed under his name but under mine.He pretended
that he wanted for once to see the world from the standpoint of the
people; that he desired for a short time to be free from the
restrictions of his rank.I myself dreaded so much entering a class so
far above me that I was glad of the chance of spending a few more months
in obscurity.For some weeks I was happy, then Lord Wilmersley began to
show himself to me as he really was.We had taken a large apartment near
the Luxembourg, and soon it became the meeting-ground for the most
reckless element of the Latin Quarter.Ah, if you but knew what sights I
saw, what things I heard in those days!I feared that my very soul was
being polluted, so I consulted a priest as to what I should do.He told
me it was my duty to remain constantly at my husband's side; with prayer
and patience I might some day succeed in reforming him.So I stayed in
that hell and bore the insults and humiliations he heaped upon me
without a murmur.Now, looking back on the past, I think my meekness and
resignation only exasperated him, for he grew more and more cruel and
seemed to think of nothing but how to torture me into revolt.Whether I
should have been given the strength to endure indefinitely, the life he
led me I do not know, but one evening, when we were as usual
entertaining a disreputable rabble, a young man entered.He was dressed in a
brown velveteen suit; a red sash encircled his waist; and on his arm he
flaunted a painted woman.I stood up and turned to
my husband.I could not speak--and he, the man I had loved, only
laughed--laughed!Never shall I forget the sound of that laughter....

"That night my child was born.That was twenty-eight years ago, but it
seems as if it were but yesterday that I held his small, warm body in my
arms.... Then comes a period of which I remember nothing, and when I
finally recovered my senses, they told me my child was dead.... As soon
as I was able to travel, I returned to my old home in Seville and there
I lived, working and praying--praying for my own soul and for that of my
poor baby, who had died without receiving the sacrament of baptism....
Years passed.I had become resigned to my lot, when one day I received a
letter from Lord Wilmersley.If I had only destroyed it unopened,
how much anguish would have been spared me!But at first when I read it,
I thought my happiness would have killed me, for Lord Wilmersley wrote
that my boy was not dead and that if I would meet him in Paris, he would
give me further news of him.At once did I set
out on my journey.On arriving in Paris I went to the hotel he had
indicated and was shown into a private _salon_.There for the first time
in a quarter of a century I saw again the man I had once regarded as my
husband.At first I had difficulty in recognising him, for now his true
character was written in every line of his face and figure.But I hardly
gave a thought either to him or to my wrongs, so great was my impatience
to hear news of my son.... Then that fiend began to play with me as a
cat with a mouse.Yes, my boy lived, had made his way in the world--that
was all he would tell me.My child had been adopted by some well-to-do
people, who had brought him up as their own--no, I needn't expect to
hear another word.Yes, he was a fine, strong lad--he would say no
more.... Can you imagine the scene?Finally, having wrought me up to the
point where I would have done anything to wring the truth from him, he
said to me: 'I have recently married a young wife and I am not such a
fool as to trust my honour in the keeping of a girl who married an old
man like me for his money.Now I have a plan to propose to you.Come and
live with her as her maid and help me to guard her from all eyes, and if
you fulfil your duties faithfully, at the end of three years I promise
that you shall see your son.'"His revolting proposition made my blood boil.Never, never, I told him,
would I accept such a humiliating situation.He merely shrugged his
shoulders and said that in that case I need never hope to hear what had
become of my son.I raved, threatened, pleaded, but he remained
inflexible, and finally I agreed to do his bidding.""So you, who call yourself a Christian, actually consented to help that
wretch to persecute his unfortunate young wife?"Valdriguez flung her head back defiantly.Besides, had she not taken him for better
or worse?Why should I have helped her to break the bonds her own vows
had imposed on her?He did not ill-treat her, far from it.He deprived
her of her liberty, but what of that?A nun has even less freedom than
she had.Think of it, day
after day I had to stand aside and watch the man I had once looked upon
as my husband, lavish his love, his thought, his very life indeed, on
that pretty doll.Although I no longer loved him, my flesh quivered at
the sight.""My lord, I care not for your judgment nor for that of any man.Would you have had me give up that sacred task
because a pink and white baby wanted to flaunt her beauty before the
world?Lady Wilmersley's fate troubles me not at all; but what
breaks my heart is that, as Arthur died just before the three years were
up, I fear that now I shall never know what has become of my boy.Sometimes I have feared that he is dead--but no, I will not believe it!"And in this
room--perhaps within reach of my hand as I stand here--is the paper
which would tell me where he is.Ah, my lord, I beg, I entreat you to
help me to find it!""I will gladly do so, but what reason have you for supposing that there
is such a paper?""It is true that I have only Lord Wilmersley's word for it," she
replied, and her voice sounded suddenly hopeless."Yet not once but many
times he said to me: 'I have a paper in which is written all you wish to
know, but as I do not trust you, I have hidden it, yes, in this very
room have I hidden it.'And now he is dead and I cannot find it!"Even if we cannot find the paper, there are other means of tracing your
son.We will advertise----"

"Never!""I will never consent to do
anything which might reveal to him the secret of his birth.I would long
ago have taken steps to find him, if I had not realised that I could not
do so without taking a number of people into my confidence, and, if I
did that, the story of my shame would be bound to leak out.Not for
myself did I care, but for him.Think of it, if what Lord Wilmersley
told me was true, he holds an honourable position, believes himself the
son of respectable parents.Would it not be horrible, if he should
suddenly learn that he is the nameless child of a servant girl and a
villain?The fear that he should somehow discover the truth is always
before me.That is why I made you swear to keep my secret.""Of course, I will do as you wish, but I assure you that you exaggerate
the risk.Still, let us first search this room thoroughly; then, if we
do not find the paper, it will be time enough to decide what we shall do
next.""Ah, my lord, you are very good to me and may God reward you as you
deserve.And to Cyril's dismay,
Valdriguez suddenly bent down and covered his hands with kisses.CHAPTER XVII

GUY RELENTS


Cyril and Valdriguez spent the next morning making a thorough search of
the library, but the paper they were looking for could not be found.Cyril had from the first been sceptical of success.He could not believe
that her child was still alive and was convinced that Arthur Wilmersley
had fabricated the story simply to retain his hold over the unfortunate
mother.Valdriguez, however, for a long time refused to abandon the
quest.Again and again she ransacked places they had already carefully
examined.When it was finally borne in upon her that there was no
further possibility of finding what she so sought, the light suddenly
went out of her face and she would have fallen if Cyril had not caught
her and placed her in a chair.With arms hanging limply to her sides,
her half-closed eyes fixed vacantly in front of her, she looked as if
death had laid his hand upon her.Thoroughly alarmed, Cyril had the
woman carried to her room and sent for a doctor.When the latter
arrived, he shook his head hopelessly.She had had a stroke; there was
very little he could do for her.In his opinion it was extremely
doubtful if she would ever fully recover her faculties, he said.Cyril having made every possible arrangement for the comfort of the
afflicted woman, at last allowed his thoughts to revert to his own
troubles.He realised that with the elimination of both Valdriguez and Prentice
there was no one but Anita left who could reasonably be suspected of the
murder; for that the two Frenchmen were implicated in the affair, was
too remote a possibility to be seriously considered.No, he must make up
his mind to face the facts: the girl was Anita Wilmersley and she had
killed her husband!What was he going to do, now that he knew the truth?Judson's advice that Anita should give herself up, he rejected without a
moment's hesitation.Yet, he had to acknowledge that there was little
hope of her being able to escape detection, as long as the police knew
her to be alive.... Suddenly an idea occurred to him.If they could only
be made to believe that she was dead, that and that alone would free her
at once and forever from their surveillance.She would be able to leave
England; to resume her life in some distant country where he.... Cyril
shrank instinctively from pursuing the delicious dream further.He tried
to force himself to consider judicially the scheme that was shaping
itself in his mind; to weigh calmly and dispassionately the chances for
and against its success.If a corpse resembling Anita were found,
dressed in the clothes she wore the day she left Geralton, it would
surely be taken for granted that the body was hers and that she had been
murdered.But how on earth was he to procure such a corpse and, having
procured it, where was he to hide it?The neighbourhood of the castle
had been so thoroughly searched that it would be no easy task to
persuade the police that they had overlooked any spot where a body might
be secreted.Certainly the plan presented almost insurmountable
difficulties, but as it was the only one he could think of, Cyril clung
to it with bull-dog tenacity.Impossible is but a word
designed to shield the incompetent or frighten the timid," he muttered
loudly in his heart, unconsciously squaring his broad shoulders.He decided to leave Geralton at once, for the plan must be carried out
immediately or not at all, and it was only in London that he could hope
to procure the necessary assistance.On arriving in town, however, Cyril had to admit that he had really no
idea what he ought to do next.If he could only get in touch with an
impoverished medical student who would agree to provide a body, the
first and most difficult part of his undertaking would be achieved.But
how and where was he to find this indispensable accomplice?Well, it was
too late to do anything that evening, he decided.He might as well go to
the club and get some dinner and try to dismiss the problem from his
mind for the time being.The first person he saw on entering the dining-room was Campbell.He was
sitting by himself at a small table; his round, rosy face depicted the
utmost dejection and he thrust his fork through an oyster with much the
same expression a man might have worn who was spearing a personal enemy.On catching sight of Cyril, he dropped his fork, jumped from his seat,
and made an eager step forward.Then, he suddenly wavered, evidently
uncertain as to the reception Cyril was going to accord him."Well, this is a piece of luck!"cried Cyril, stretching out his hand.Guy, looking decidedly sheepish, clasped it eagerly."I might as well tell you at once that I know I made no end of an ass of
myself the other day," he said, averting his eyes from his friend's
face."It is really pretty decent of you not to have resented my
ridiculous accusations.""Oh, that's all right," Cyril assured him, "I quite understood your
motive.But I am awfully glad you have changed your attitude towards me,
for to tell you the truth, I am in great need of your assistance."ejaculated Campbell, screwing up his face into an expression
of comic despair.As soon as there was no danger of their being overheard, Cyril told
Campbell of his interview with Judson.At first Guy could not be
persuaded that the girl was Anita Wilmersley."She is not a liar, I am sure of it!If she said that her hair had
turned white, it had turned white, and therefore it is impossible that
she had dyed it," objected Campbell."Judson suggested that she dyed only part of her hair and that it was
the rest which turned white."Having finally convinced Guy that there was no doubt as to the girl's
identity, Cyril proceeded to unfold his plan for rescuing her from the
police.Guy adjusted his eye-glass and stared at his friend speechless with
consternation."This affair has turned your brain," he finally gasped."Your plan is
absurd, absolutely absurd, I tell you.Why, even if I could bribe some
one to procure me a corpse, how on earth could you get it to Geralton?""And where under Heaven are you to hide it?""Get me a corpse and I will arrange the rest," Cyril assured him with
more confidence than he really felt."First you saddle me with a lot of stolen jewels and now you want me to
travel around the country with a corpse under my arm!I say, you do
select nice, pleasant jobs for me!""Can't say I have," acknowledged Guy."Are you willing to sit still and see Anita Wilmersley arrested?""Certainly not, but your scheme is a mad one--madder than anything I
should have credited even you with having conceived."Campbell paused a
moment as if considering the question in all its aspects."However, the
fact that it is crazy may save us.The police will not be likely to
suspect two reputable members of society, whose sanity has so far not
been doubted, of attempting to carry through such a wild, impossible
plot.Yes," he mused, "the very impossibility of the thing may make it
possible.""Glad you agree with me," cried Cyril enthusiastically."Now how soon
can you get a corpse, do you think?"You talk as if I could order one from Whiteley's.When
can I get you a corpse--indeed?To-morrow--in a week--a month--a
year--never.The last-mentioned date I consider the most likely.I will
do what I can, that is all I can say; but how I am to go to work, upon
my word, I haven't the faintest idea.""You are an awfully clever chap, Guy."I am the absolute fool, but I am
still sane enough to know it.""Very well, I'll acknowledge that you are a fool and I only wish there
were more like you," said Cyril, clapping his friend affectionately on
the back."By the way," he added, turning away as if in search of a match and
trying to speak as carelessly as possible, "How is Anita?"For a moment Guy did not answer and Cyril stood fumbling with the
matches fearful of the effect of the question.He was still doubtful how
far his friend had receded from his former position and was much
relieved when Guy finally answered in a very subdued voice:

"She is pretty well--but--" He hesitated.He noticed that Guy's face had lengthened
perceptibly and that he toyed nervously with his eye-glass."The fact is," replied Campbell, speaking slowly and carefully avoiding
the other's eye, "I think it is possible that she misses you."Cyril's heart gave a sudden jump."I can hardly believe it," he managed to stutter."Of course, Miss Trevor may be mistaken.It was her idea, not mine, that
Ani--Lady Wilmersley I mean--is worrying over your absence.But whatever
the cause, the fact remains that she has changed very much.She is no
longer frank and cordial in her manner either to Miss Trevor or myself.It seems almost as if she regarded us both with suspicion, though what
she can possibly suspect us of, I can't for the life of me imagine.That
day at lunch she was gay as a child, but now she is never anything but
sad and preoccupied.""Perhaps she is beginning to remember the past," suggested Cyril.Miss Trevor and I have tried everything we could think
of to induce her to confide in us, but she won't.Possibly you might be
more successful--" An involuntary sigh escaped Campbell."I am sorry now
that I prevented you from seeing her.Mind you, I still think it wiser
not to do so, but I ought to have left you free to use your own
judgment.The number of her sitting-room is 62, on the second floor and,
for some reason or other, she insists on being left there alone every
afternoon from three to four.Now I have told you all I know of the
situation and you must handle it as you think best."CHAPTER XVIII

A SLIP OF THE TONGUE


Cyril spent the night in a state of pitiable indecision.Should he or
should he not risk a visit to Anita?If the police were shadowing him,
it would be fatal, but he had somehow lately acquired the conviction
that they were not.On the other hand, if he could only see her, how it
would simplify everything!As she distrusted both Guy and Miss Trevor,
even if his plot succeeded, she would probably refuse to leave England
unless he himself told her that he wished her to do so.Besides, there
were so many details to be discussed, so many arrangements to be talked
over."Yes," he said to himself as he lay staring into the darkness, "it
is my duty to see her.I shall go to her not because I want to...." A
horrid doubt made him pause.Was he so sure that his decision was not
the outcome of his own desire?How could he trust his judgment in a
matter where his inclinations were so deeply involved?Yet it would be
shocking if he allowed his own feelings to induce him to do something
which might be injurious to Anita.It was a nice question to determine
whether her need of him was sufficient to justify him in risking a
visit?For hours he debated with himself but could arrive at no
conclusion.No sooner did he resolve to stay away from her than the
thought of her unhappiness again made him waver.If he only knew why she
was so unhappy, he told himself that the situation would not be so
unendurable.When he had talked to her over the telephone, she had
seemed cheerful; she had spoken of Guy and Miss Trevor with enthusiasm.What could have occurred since then to make her distrust them and to
plunge her into such a state of gloom?As he tossed to and fro on his
hot, tumbled bed, his imagination pictured one dire possibility after
another, till at last he made up his mind that he could bear the
uncertainty no longer.Having reached this decision, Cyril could hardly refrain from rushing
off to her as soon as it was light.However, he had to curb his
impatience.Three o'clock was the only hour he could be sure of finding
her alone; so he must wait till three o'clock.But how on earth, he
asked himself, was he going to get through the intervening time?He was
in a state of feverish restlessness that was almost agony; he could not
apply himself to anything; he could only wait--wait.Although he knew
that there was no chance of his meeting Anita, he haunted the
neighbourhood of the "George" all the morning.Every few minutes he
consulted his watch and the progress of the hands seemed to him so
incredibly slow that more than once he thought that it must have stopped
altogether.Flinging back his shoulders and assuming a carelessness that almost
amounted to a swagger, Cyril entered the hotel.He was so self-conscious
that it was with considerable surprise as well as relief that he noticed
that no one paid the slightest attention to him.Even the porter hardly
glanced at him, being at the moment engaged in speeding a parting guest.Cyril decided to use the stairs in preference to the lift, as they were
less frequented than the latter, and as it happened, he made his way up
to the second landing without encountering anybody.There, however, he came face to face with a pretty housemaid, who to his
dismay looked at him attentively.Had he but
known it, she had been attracted by his tall, soldierly figure and had
merely offered him the tribute of an admiring glance.But this
explanation never occurred to our modest hero and he hurried, quite
absurdly flustered by this trifling incident.62
opened on a small, ill-lighted hall, which was for the moment completely
deserted.Now that he actually stood on the threshold of Anita's room, Cyril felt
a curious reluctance to proceed farther.It was unwise.... She might not
want to see him.... But even as these objections flashed through his
mind, he knocked almost involuntarily.His heart was beating like a sledge-hammer and
his hands were trembling.Never had he experienced such a curious
sensation before and he wondered vaguely what could be the matter with
him."I can't stand here forever," he said in his heart."I wanted to see
her; well then, why don't I open the door?Still reasoning with himself, he finally entered the room.A bright fire was burning on the hearth and before it were heaped a
number of cushions and from this lowly seat Anita had apparently hastily
arisen.The length of time he had taken to answer her summons had
evidently alarmed her, for she stood like a creature at bay, her eyes
wide open and frightened.On recognising Cyril a deep blush suffused her
face and even coloured the whiteness of her throat.Her relief was obvious, yet her manner was distant, almost repellent.Cyril had confidently anticipated such a different reception that her
unexpected coldness completed his discomfiture.He felt as if the
foundations of his world were giving away beneath his feet.He managed,
however, to murmur something, he knew not what.The pounding of his
heart prevented him from thinking coherently.When his emotion had
subsided sufficiently for him to realise what he was doing, he found
himself sitting stiffly on one side of the fire with Anita sitting
equally stiffly on the other.She was talking--no, rather she was
engaging him in polite conversation.How long she had been doing so he
did not know, but he gathered that it could not have been long, as she
was still on the subject of the weather.I hope you had better luck in the
country.To-day has been especially disagreeable," she was saying.Cyril abused the weather with a vigour which was rather surprising, in
view of the fact that till she had mentioned it, he had been sublimely
unconscious whether the sun had been shining or not.But finally even
that prolific topic was exhausted and as no other apparently suggested
itself to either, they relapsed into a constrained silence.He had so longed to see her, and now an
impalpable barrier had somehow arisen between them which separated them
more completely than mere bricks and mortar, than any distance could
have done.True, he could feast his eyes on her cameo-like profile; on
the soft curve of her cheek; on the long, golden-tipped lashes; on the
slender, white throat, which rose like a column from the laces of her
dress.But he dared not look at her too long.Cyril was not
introspective and was only dimly aware of the cause of the turmoil which
was raging in his heart.He did not know that he averted his eyes for
fear that the primitive male within him would break loose from the
fetters of his will and forcibly seize the small creature so temptingly
within his reach."If I only knew what I have done to displease her!"He longed to question her, but she held herself so rigidly aloof that he
had not the courage to do so.It was in vain that he told himself that
her coldness simplified the situation; that it would have been terrible
to have had to repel her advances; but he could find no consolation in
the thought.In speechless misery he sat gazing into the fire.Suddenly he thrilled with the consciousness that she was looking at him.The glance they exchanged was of the briefest duration, but it sufficed
to lift the weight which had been crushing him.The corners of her mouth quivered slightly, but she did not answer."If I have," he continued, "I assure you it was quite unintentionally.Why, I would give my life to save you a moment's pain.Can't you feel
that I am speaking the truth?"She turned her face towards him, and as he looked at her, Cyril realised
that it was not only her manner which had altered; she herself had
mysteriously altered.At first he could not define wherein the
difference lay, but suddenly it flashed upon him.It was the expression
of her eyes which had changed.Heretofore he had been confident that
they reflected her every emotion; but now they were inscrutable.It was
as if she had drawn a veil over her soul."I don't know what you mean," she said.There was more than a hint of
hostility in her voice.If my visit is
distasteful to you, you have only to say so and I will go."As she did not immediately answer, he added:

"Perhaps I had better go."His tone, however, somehow implied more of a
threat than a suggestion; for since they had exchanged that fleeting
glance Cyril had felt unreasonably reassured.Despite her coldness, the
memory of her tender entreaties for his speedy return, buoyed up his
conceit.She could not be as indifferent to him as she seemed, he argued
to himself.However, as the moments passed and she offered no objection
to his leaving her, his newly-aroused confidence evaporated.But he made
no motion to do so; he could not."I can't leave her till I know how I have offended her.... There are so
many arrangements to be made.... I must get in touch with her again,--"
were some of the excuses with which he tried to convince himself that he
had a right to linger.He tried to read her face, but she had averted her head till he could
see nothing but one small, pink ear, peeping from beneath her curls."It is a little difficult to know how you wish to be treated!"Her
manner was icy, but his relief was so intense that he scarcely noticed
it."She is piqued, that
is the whole trouble."He felt a man once more, master of the situation."She probably expected me to--" He shrank from pursuing the thought any
further as the hot blood surged to his face.He was again conscious of
his helplessness."I suppose you
think me cold and unfeeling?She seemed startled by his vehemence, for she looked up at him timidly."Won't you tell me what has come
between us?"Right and wrong ceased to exist for
him.He forgot everything; stooping forward he gathered her into his
arms and crushed her small body against his heart.She thrust him from her with unexpected force and stood before him with
blazing eyes."You cannot treat me like a child, who can be neglected one day and
fondled the next!At the nursing home I was too weak
and confused to realise how strangely you were behaving, but now I know.You dare to complain of my coldness--my coldness indeed!Is my coldness
a match to yours?"If you do, then your conduct is all the more inexplicable.If you do,
then I ask you, what is it, who is it, that stands between us?""If I could tell you, don't you suppose I would?""Then there is some one, some person who is keeping us apart!""Ah, you see, you can't deny it!He hardly knew what he was saying; the words seemed to have leaped to
his lips.She regarded him for a second in silence evidently only partially
convinced.He had momentarily forgotten his wife, and
although he tried to convince himself that he had spoken the truth and
that it was not she who was keeping them apart, yet he had to
acknowledge that if he had been free, he would certainly have behaved
very differently towards Anita.So in a sense he had lied to her and as
he realised this, his eyes sank before hers.She did not fail to note
his embarrassment and pressed her point inexorably."Swear that there is no other woman who has a claim on you and I will
believe you."He could not lie to her in cold blood.Yet to tell her the truth was
also out of the question, he said to himself.While he still hesitated, she continued more vehemently."I don't ask you to tell me anything of your past or my past, if you had
rather not do so.One thing, however, I must and will know--who is this
woman and what are her pretensions?""I--I cannot tell you," he said at last.Some day,
I promise you, you shall know everything, but now it is impossible.But
this much I will say--I love you as I have never loved any one in my
whole life."She trembled from head to foot and half closed her eyes.Cyril felt that this very silence
established a communion between them, more complete, more intense than
any words could have done.But as he gazed at the small, drooping
figure, he felt that his self-control was deserting him completely.He
almost reeled with the violence of his emotion."I can't stand it another moment," he said to himself."I must go
before--" He did not finish the sentence but clenched his hands till the
knuckles showed white through the skin.I can't tell you
what I feel.He murmured incoherently and seizing her hands,
he pressed them for an instant against his lips, then dropping them
abruptly, he fled from the room.Cyril in his excitement had not noticed that he had called Anita by her
name nor did he perceive the start she gave when she heard it.After the
door had clicked behind him, she sat as if turned to stone, white to her
very lips.Slowly, as if with an effort, her lips moved.she repeated over and over
again as if she were trying to learn a difficult lesson.But the tension had been too great; with a little gasp she sank fainting
to the floor.CHAPTER XIX

AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR


What he did during the next few hours, Cyril never quite knew.He
retained a vague impression of wandering through endless streets and of
being now and then arrested in his heedless course by the angry
imprecations of some wayfarer he had inadvertently jostled or of some
Jehu whose progress he was blocking.How could he have behaved like such a fool, he kept asking himself.He
had not said a thing to Anita that he had meant to say--not one.Worse
still, he had told her that he loved her!He had even held her in his
arms!Cyril tried not to exult at the thought.He told himself again and
again that he had acted like a cad; nevertheless the memory of that
moment filled him with triumphant rapture.Had he lost all sense of
shame, he wondered.He tried to consider Anita's situation, his own
situation; but he could not.He could think
neither of the past nor of the future; he could think of nothing
connectedly.The daylight waned and still he tramped steadily onward.Finally,
however, his body began to assert itself.His footsteps grew gradually
slower, till at last he realised that he was miles from home and that he
was completely exhausted.Hailing a passing conveyance, he drove to his
lodgings.He was still so engrossed in his dreams that he felt no surprise at
finding Peter sitting in the front hall, nor did he notice the dejected
droop of the latter's shoulders.On catching sight of his master, Peter sprang forward.My lord," he whispered with his finger on his lip; and turning
slightly, he cast an apprehensive glance over his shoulder towards the
top of the stairs.With an effort Cyril shook off his preoccupation.Following the
direction of his servant's eyes, he saw nothing more alarming than a few
dusty plants which were supposed to adorn the small landing where the
stairs turned.Before he had time to form a conjecture as to the cause
of Peter's agitation, the latter continued breathlessly: "Her Ladyship
'ave arrived, my lord!"Having made this announcement, he stepped back as if to watch what
effect this information would have on his master.There was no doubt
that Peter's alarm was very genuine, yet one felt that in spite of it he
was enjoying the dramatic possibilities of the situation.Cyril, however, only blinked at him uncomprehendingly."Lady Wilmersley, my lord, and she brought her baggage.I haven't known
what to do, that I haven't.I knew she ought not to stay here, but I
couldn't turn 'er out, could I?"Cyril's mind was so full of Anita that he never doubted that it was she
to whom Peter was referring, so without waiting to ask further
questions, he rushed upstairs two steps at a time, and threw open the
door of his sitting-room.On a low chair in front of the fire his wife sat reading quietly.Cyril staggered back as if he had been struck.She, however, only turned
her head languidly and closing her book, surveyed him with a mocking
smile.His disappointment added fuel to his
indignation.She seemed in nowise affected by his anger; only her expression became,
if possible, a trifle more contemptuous."Your manners have sadly deteriorated since we parted," she remarked,
raising her eyebrows superciliously.he exclaimed and his voice actually shook with rage."May I
ask how you expected to be received?Is it possible that you imagine
that I am going to take you back?"Her eyes narrowed, but she still appeared quite unconcerned."Do you know, I rather think you will," she drawled."Take you back, now that you have tired of your lover or he has become
disgusted with you, which is probably nearer the truth.Do you think I
am mad, or are you?"He fancied that he saw her wince, but she replied calmly:

"Do not let us indulge in mutual recriminations.What have you to reproach
me with?Didn't I marry you to save you from disgrace and penury?Haven't I done everything I could to keep you straight?"She rose slowly from her seat and he noticed for the first time that she
wore a low-cut gown of some diaphanous material, which revealed and yet
softened the too delicate lines of her sinuous figure.Her black hair
lay in thick waves around her face, completely covering the ears, and
wound in a coil at the back of her neck.He had never seen it arranged
in this fashion and reluctantly he had to admit that it was strangely
becoming to her.A wide band of dull gold, set with uncut gems,
encircled her head and added a barbaric note to her exotic beauty.It
was his last gift to her, he remembered.Yes, she was still beautiful, he acknowledged, although the life she had
led, had left its marks upon her.She looked older and frailer than when
he had seen her last.But to-night the sunken eyes glowed with
extraordinary brilliancy and a soft colour gave a certain roundness to
her hollow cheeks.As she stood before him, Cyril was conscious, for the
first time in years, of the alluring charm of her personality.She regarded him for a moment, her full red lips parted in an
inscrutable smile.In some mysterious way it suggested infinite
possibilities."You tried everything, I grant you," she said at last, "except the one
thing which would have proved efficacious."Yes, it was true, he
acknowledged to himself.Had he not realised it during the last few days
as he had never done before?"You don't even take the trouble to deny it," she continued."You
married me out of pity and instead of being ashamed of it, you actually
pride yourself on the purity of your motive.""Well, at any rate I can't see what there was to be ashamed of," he
replied indignantly.Oh, how you good people exasperate me!You seem to
lack all comprehension of the natural cravings of a normal human being."It was not my fault that I could not love you.""No, but knowing that you did not love me, it was dastardly of you to
have married me without telling me the truth.In doing so, you took from
me my objective in life--you destroyed my ideals.Oh, don't look so
sceptical, you fool!Can't you see that I should never have remained a
governess until I was twenty-five, if I had not had ideals?It was
because I had such lofty conceptions of love that I kept myself
scrupulously aloof from men, so that I might come to my mate, when I
found him, with soul, mind, and body unsullied."She spoke with such passionate sincerity that it was with an effort
Cyril reminded himself that her past had not been as blameless as she
pictured it."Your fine ideals did not prevent you from becoming a drunkard--" he
remarked drily."When I married, I was not a drunkard," she vehemently protested."The
existence I led was abhorrent to me, and it is true that occasionally
when I felt I could not stand it another moment, I would go to my room
after dinner and get what comfort I could out of alcohol; but what I
did, I did deliberately and not to satisfy an ungovernable appetite.I
was no more a drunkard than a woman who takes a dose of morphine during
bodily agony is a drug fiend.Of course, my conduct seems inexcusable to
you, for you are quite incapable of understanding the torture my life
was to me.""Other women have suffered far greater misfortunes and have borne them
with fortitude and dignity.""Look at me, Cyril; even now am I like other women?""Was it my fault that I was born with beauty that demanded its
due?Was I to blame that my blood leaped wildly through my veins, that
my imagination was always on fire?But I was, and still am,
instinctively and fundamentally a virtuous woman.Oh, you may sneer, but
it is true!Although as a girl I was starving for love, I never accepted
passion as a substitute, and you can't realise how incessantly the
latter was offered me.Wherever I went, I was persecuted by it.At times
I had a horrible fear that desire was all that I was capable of evoking;
and when you came to me in my misery, poverty, and disgrace, I hailed
you as my king--my man!I believed that you were offering me a love so
great that it welcomed the sacrifice of every minor consideration.It
never occurred to me that you would dare to ask me for myself, my life,
my future, unless you were able to give me in exchange something more
than the mere luxuries of existence.""I also offered you my life----"

"You did not!""You offered up your life, not to
me, but to your own miserable conception of chivalry.The greatness of
your sacrifice intoxicated you and consequently it seemed to you
inevitable that I also would spend the rest of my days in humble
contemplation of your sublime character?""Such an idea never occurred to me," Cyril angrily objected."Oh, you never formulated it in so many words, I know that!You are too
self-conscious to be introspective and are actually proud of the fact
that you never stop to analyse either yourself or your motives.So you
go blundering through life without in the least realising what are the
influences which shape your actions.You fancy that you are not
self-centred because you are too shy, yes, and too vain to probe the
hidden recesses of your heart.You imagine that you are unselfish
because you make daily sacrifices to your own ideal of conduct.But of
that utter forgetfulness of self, of that complete merging and
submerging of your identity in another's, you have never had even the
vaguest conception.When you married me, it never occurred to you that I
had the right to demand both love and comprehension.You, the idealist,
expected me to be satisfied with the material advantages you offered;
but I, the degraded creature you take me to be, had I known the truth,
would never have consented to sell my birthright for a mess of pottage.""That sounds all very fine, and I confess I may not have been a perfect
husband, but after all, what would you have done, I should like to know,
if I had not married you?"I would have worked and hoped, and if work had failed me, I would
have begged and hoped.I would even have starved, before abandoning the
hope that some day I should find the man who was destined for me.When I
at last realised that you did not love me, you cannot imagine my
despair.I consumed myself in futile efforts to please you, but the very
intensity of my love prevented me from exercising those arts and
artifices which might have brought you to my feet.My emotion in your
presence was so great that it sealed my lips and made you find me a dull
companion."You know very well that it was not that which
alienated me from you.When I married you, I may not have been what is
called in love with you, but I was certainly fond of you, and if you had
behaved yourself, I should no doubt in time have become more closely
united to you.You talk of 'consuming' yourself to please me.But you chose a
strange means of gaining my affections when you took to disgracing
yourself both privately and publicly."The passionate resentment which had transfigured her slowly faded from
Amy's face, leaving it drawn and old; her voice, when she spoke, sounded
infinitely weary."When I knew for a certainty that a lukewarm affection was all you would
ever feel for me, I lost hope, and in losing hope, I lost my foothold on
life.I wanted to die--I determined to die.Time and time again, I
pressed your pistol to my forehead, but something stronger than my will
always prevented me from pulling the trigger; and finally I sought
forgetfulness in drink, because I had not the courage to find it in
death.At first I tried to hide my condition from you, but there came a
moment when the sight of your bland self-satisfaction became unbearable,
when your absolute unconsciousness of the havoc you had made of my life
maddened me.Oh, not as I had suffered, you are
not capable of that; but at any rate I could hurt your vanity and deal a
death-blow to your pride!You had disgraced me when you tricked me into
giving myself to a man who did not love me; I determined to disgrace you
by reeling through the public streets.she cried
with indescribable bitterness."When I saw you grow pale with anger,
when I saw you tremble with shame, I suppose you fancy that I must, at
times, have suffered from remorse and humiliation?I swear that never
for a moment have I regretted the course I chose.I am ashamed of
nothing except that I lacked the courage to kill myself.How I welcomed the gradual deadening of my senses, the dulling of my
fevered brain!When I awoke from my long torpor and found myself at
Charleroi, I cursed the doctor who had brought me back to life.The thought of you haunted me day and
night, while a raging thirst racked my body, and from this twofold
torture the constant supervision of the nurses prevented me from
obtaining even a temporary respite.For a moment Cyril felt a wave of pity sweep over him, but suddenly he
stiffened."You forget to mention that--consolation was offered you."Had I found that, I should not be here!I admit, however,
that when I first noticed that M. de Brissac was attracted by me, I was
mildly pleased.It was a solace to my wounded vanity to find that some
one still found me desirable.But I swear that it never even occurred to
me to give myself to him, till the doctor told me that you were coming
to take me away with you.Subject myself anew to your
indifference--your contempt?So I took the only means of escaping
from you which offered itself.And I am glad, glad that I flung myself
into the mire, for by defiling love, I killed it.I am at last free from
the obsession which has been the torment of my life.Neither you nor any
other man will again fire my imagination or stir my senses.I am dead,
but I am also free--free!"As she spoke the last words her expression was so exalted that Cyril was
forced to grant her his grudging admiration.As she stood before him,
she seemed more a spirit than a woman; she seemed the incarnation of
life, of love, of the very fundamentals of existence.She was really an
extraordinary woman; why did he not love her, he asked himself.But even
as this flashed through his mind the memory of his long martyrdom
obtruded itself.He saw her again not as she appeared then, but as the
central figure in a succession of loathsome scenes."Your attempt to justify yourself may impose on others, but not on me.What you term love is
nothing but an abnormal craving, which no healthy-minded man with his
work in life to do could have possibly satisfied.Our code, however, is
too different for me to discuss the matter with you.And so, if you have
quite finished expatiating on my shortcomings, would you kindly tell me
to what I owe the honour of your visit?"She turned abruptly from him and leaned for a minute against the
mantelpiece; then, sinking into a chair, she took a cigarette from a box
which lay on the table near her and proceeded to light it with apparent
unconcern.Cyril, however, noticed that her hand trembled violently.After inhaling a few puffs, she threw her head back and looked at him
tauntingly from between her narrowed lids."Because, my dear Cyril, I read in yesterday's paper that your wife had
been your companion on your ill-timed journey from Paris.So I thought
it would be rather amusing to run over and find out a few particulars as
to the young person who is masquerading under my name."She had caught Cyril completely off his guard and he felt for a moment
incapable of parrying her attack."I assure you," he stuttered, "it is all a mistake--" He hesitated; he
could think of no explanation which would satisfy her."I expected you to tell me that she was as pure as snow!""But how you with your puritanic ideas managed to
get yourself into such an imbroglio passes my understanding.Really, I
consider that you owe it to me, to satisfy my curiosity.""I regret that I am unable to do so."Still, as I shall no doubt solve the riddle in a few days, I
can possess my soul in patience.Meanwhile I shall enjoy watching your
efforts to prevent me from learning the truth.""Unfortunately for you, that pleasure will be denied you.You are going
to leave this house at once and we shall not meet again till we do so
before judge and jury.""So you will persist in trying to bluff it out?Don't you
realise that I hold all the cards and that I am quite clever enough to
use them to the best advantage?You see, knowing you as I do, I am
convinced that the motive which led you to sacrifice both truth and
honour is probably as praiseworthy as it is absurd.But having made such
a sacrifice, why are you determined to render it useless?I cannot
believe that you are willing to face the loss not only of your own
reputation but of that of the young person who has accepted your
protection.How do you fancy she would enjoy figuring as corespondent in
a divorce suit?"Cyril felt as if he were caught in a trap."My God," he cried, "you wouldn't do that!I swear to you that she is
absolutely innocent.She was in a terrible situation and to say that she
was my wife seemed the only way to save her.She doesn't even know I am
married!"And have you never considered that when she finds out the
truth, she may fail to appreciate the delicacy which no doubt prevented
you from mentioning the trifling fact of my existence?It is rather
funny that your attempts to rescue forlorn damsels seem doomed to be
unsuccessful!Or were your motives in this case not quite so impersonal
as I fancied?Has Launcelot at last found his Guinevere?If so, I may
yet be avenged vicariously.""Your presence is punishment enough, I assure you, for all the sins I
ever committed!What exactly is it that you are
threatening me with?"If neither you nor this woman object to its
being known that you travelled together as man and wife, then I am
powerless.""But you have just acknowledged that you know that our relation is a
harmless one," cried Cyril."I do not know it--but--yes, I believe it.Do you think, however, that
any one else will do so?""Surely you would not be such a fiend as to wreck the life of an
innocent young girl?""If her life is wrecked, whose fault is it?It
was you who by publicly proclaiming her to be your wife, made it
impossible for her disgrace to remain a secret.Don't you realise that
even if I took no steps in the matter, sooner or later the truth is
bound to be discovered?Now I--and I alone--can save you from the
consequences of your folly.If you will agree not to divorce me, I
promise not only to keep your secret, but to protect the good name of
this woman by every means in my power.""I should like to know what you expect to gain by trying to force me to
take you back?Is it the title that you covet, or do you long to shine
in society?But remember that in order to do that, you would have
radically to reform your habits.""I have no intention of reforming and I don't care a fig for
conventional society!""You tell me that you no longer love me and that you found existence
with me unsupportable.Why then are you not willing to end it?""It is true, I no longer love you, but while I live, no other woman
shall usurp my place."When you broke your marriage vows, you forfeited your right
to a place in my life.You can have
all the money you can possibly want as long as you neither do nor say
anything to imperil the reputation of the young lady in question.""All the wealth in the world could not buy my silence!""In order to
shield a poor innocent child, you demand that I sacrifice my freedom, my
future, even my honour?Have you no sense of justice, no pity?"It is now for you to decide whether I
am to go or stay.Cyril looked into her white, set face; what he read there destroyed his
last, lingering hope."Stay," he muttered through his clenched teeth.CHAPTER XX

"I KNOW IT, COUSIN CYRIL"


Cyril leaned wearily back in his chair.He was in that state of
apathetic calm which sometimes succeeds a violent emotion.Of his wife
he had neither seen or heard anything since they parted the night
before.Cyril started, for he had not noticed Peter's entrance and the
suppressed excitement of the latter's manner alarmed him."She's 'ere, my lord," replied Peter, dropping his voice till it was
almost a whisper."The--the young lady, my lord, as you took charge of on the train.I was
just passing through the 'all as she came in and so----"

"Here?""Why didn't you show her up at once?""If 'er Ladyship should 'ear----"

"Mind your own business, you fool, or----"

But Peter had already scuttled out of the room.Cyril waited, every nerve strung to the highest tension.Yet if his visitor was really Anita, some new
misfortune must have occurred!It seemed to him ages before the door
again opened and admitted a small, cloaked figure, whose features were
practically concealed by a heavy veil.A glance, however, sufficed to
assure him that it was indeed Anita who stood before him.While Cyril
was struggling to regain his composure, she lifted her veil.The
desperation of her eyes appalled him.cried Cyril, striding forward and seizing
her hands."Lord Wilmersley--" Cyril jumped as if he had been shot."Yes," she
continued, "I know who you are.For the first time the ghost of a smile hovered round her lips.What a blundering fool I have been from first to last!"For some days I had been haunted by
fragmentary visions of the past and before I saw you yesterday, I was
practically certain that you were not my husband.It was not without
a struggle that I finally made up my mind that you had deceived me.I
told myself again and again that you were not the sort of a man who
would take advantage of an unprotected girl; yet the more I thought
about it, the more convinced I became that my suspicions were correct.Then I tried to imagine what reason you could have for posing as my
husband, but I could think of none.I didn't know what
to do, whom to turn to; for if I could not trust you, whom could I
trust?When I heard my name, it was as if a dim light suddenly flooded
my brain.I remembered leaving Geralton, but little by
little I realised with dismay that I was still completely in the dark as
to who you were, why you had come into my life.It seemed to me that if
I could not discover the truth, I should go mad.Then I decided to
appeal to Miss Trevor.I was somehow convinced that she did not know who I was, but I said
to myself that she would certainly have heard of my disappearance, for I
could not believe that Arthur had allowed me to go out of his life
without moving heaven and earth to find me.""No; it was Miss Trevor who told me that Arthur was dead--that he had
been murdered.""You see," she added with
pathetic humility, "there are still so many things I do not remember.Even now I can hardly believe that I, I of all people, killed my
husband."Cyril ached for pity of her."Why take it for granted that you did?"he suggested, partly from a
desire to comfort her, but also because there really lingered a doubt in
his mind."Not at present, but----"

She threw up her hands with a gesture of despair.But I never meant to--you will believe that, won't
you?Those doctors were right, I must have been insane!"Arthur only intended to frighten you by sending
for those men.""But if I was not crazy, why can I remember so little of what took place
on that dreadful night and for some time afterwards?""I am told that a severe shock often has that effect," replied Cyril."But, oh, how I wish you could answer a few questions!I don't want to
raise your hopes; but there is one thing that has always puzzled me and
till that is explained I for one shall always doubt whether it was you
who killed Arthur."Again the eager light leaped into her eyes."Oh, tell me quickly what--what makes you think that I may not have done
so?"Cyril contemplated her a moment in silence.He longed to pursue the
topic, but was fearful of the effect it might have on her."Yet now that she knows the worst, it may be a relief to her to talk
about it," he said to himself."Yes, I will risk it," he finally
decided."Do you remember that you put a drug in Arthur's coffee?""Then you must have expected to make your escape before he regained
consciousness.""Then why did you arm yourself with a pistol?""But if you shot Arthur, you must have had a pistol."She stared at Cyril in evident bewilderment."I could have sworn I had no pistol."Cyril tried to control his rising excitement."You knew, however, that
Arthur owned one?""Yes, but I never knew where he kept it.""You are sure you have not forgotten----"

"No, no!""My memory is perfectly clear up to the
time when Arthur seized me and threw me on the floor.""Oh, yes, I have a vague recollection of a long walk through the
dark--of a train--of you--of policemen.But everything is so confused
that I can be sure of nothing."Cyril paced the room deep in thought."It seems to me incredible," he said at last, "that if you did not even
know where to look for a pistol, you should have found it, to say
nothing of having been able to use it, while you were being beaten into
unconsciousness by that brute.""It is extraordinary, and yet I must have done so.For it has been
proved, has it not, that Arthur and I were absolutely alone?"How can we be sure that some one was not concealed in
the room or did not climb in through the window or--why, there are a
thousand possibilities which can never be proved!"she exclaimed, her whole body trembling with eagerness."I now
remember that I had put all my jewels in a bag, and as that has
disappeared, a burglar--" But as she scanned Cyril's face, she paused."You had the bag with you at the nursing home.The jewels are safe," he
said very gently."Then," she cried, "it is useless trying to deceive ourselves any
longer--I killed Arthur and must face the consequences.""But don't you see that I can't spend the rest of my life in hiding?Think what it would mean to live in daily, hourly dread of exposure?That is not what
I am afraid of.But the idea of you, Anita, in prison.Why, it is out of
the question."And if it did, what of it?"There is nothing you can do," she said, laying her hand gently on his
arm.Oh, I can never thank you enough
for all your goodness to me!""Don't--don't--I would gladly give my life for you!""I know it, Cousin Cyril," she murmured, with downcast eyes.A wave of
colour swept for a moment over her face.With a mighty effort he strove to regain his composure.Yes, that was what he was to her--that was all he could
ever be to her."I know how noble, how unselfish you are," she continued, lifting her
brimming eyes to his.Anita, is it possible that you----"

"Hush!Let me go," she cried, for Cyril had seized
her hand and was covering it with kisses.Cyril and Anita moved hurriedly
away from each other."Inspector Griggs is 'ere, my lord."Peter's face had resumed its usual stolid expression.He appeared not to
notice that his master and the latter's guest were standing in strained
attitudes at opposite ends of the room.Cyril motioned Peter impatiently away."This is the best
time for me to give myself up."I have a plan----"

He was interrupted by the reappearance of Peter."The inspector is very sorry, my lord, but he has to see you at once, 'e
says.""It is no use putting it off," Anita said firmly.If you don't, I shall go down and speak to him myself."Cyril did not know what to do.So turning to the latter, he said:

"You can bring him up in ten minutes--not before."Anita," implored Cyril, as soon as they were again alone, "I beg you
not to do this thing.If a plan that I have in mind succeeds, you will
be able to leave the country and begin life again under another name."She listened attentively, but when he had finished she shook her head."I will not allow you to attempt it.If your fraud were discovered--and
it would surely be discovered--your life would be ruined.""I tell you I will not hear of it.No, I am determined to end this
horrible suspense."I entreat you at all events to wait a little while longer."Was there
nothing he could say to turn her from her purpose?If she should hear, if she should know--" he began
tentatively.He was amazed at the effect of his words."Why didn't you tell me that she was here?""Of course, I haven't the slightest intention of
involving her in my affairs."But you can't leave the house without Griggs seeing you, and he would
certainly guess who you are.Stay in the next room till he is gone, that
is all I ask of you.Here, quick, I hear footsteps on the stairs."Cyril had hardly time to fling himself into a chair before the inspector
was announced.CHAPTER XXI

THE TRUTH


"Good-morning, my lord.Rather early to disturb you, I am afraid."Cyril noticed that Griggs's manner had undergone a subtle change.Although perfectly respectful, he seemed to hold himself rigidly aloof.There was even a certain solemnity about his trivial greeting.Cyril
felt that another blow was impending.Instantly and instinctively he
braced himself to meet it."The fact is, my lord, I should like to ask you a few questions, but I
warn you that your answers may be used against you.""Have you missed a bag, my lord?"It has turned up at last," thought Cyril.He knows more about my things than I do," he
managed to answer, as he lifted a perfectly expressionless face to
Griggs's inspection.But I fancy that as far as this particular bag is
concerned, that is not the case.""Because I do not see what reason he could have had for hiding one of
his master's bags up the chimney.""So the bag was found up the chimney?Will you tell me what motive I am
supposed to have had for wishing to conceal it?Did it contain anything you thought I might want to
get rid of?"We know that Priscilla Prentice bought this bag a
fortnight ago in Newhaven.Now, if you are able to explain how it came
into your possession, I would strongly advise your doing so.""I have never to my knowledge laid eyes on the girl, and I cannot,
therefore, believe that a bag of hers has been found here.""We can prove it," replied the inspector."The maker's name is inside
and the man who sold it to her is willing to swear that it is the
identical bag.One of our men has made friends with your chamber-maid
and she confessed that she had discovered it stuffed up the chimney in
your bedroom.She is a stupid girl and thought you had thrown it away,
so she took it.Only afterwards, it occurred to her that you had a
purpose in placing the bag where she had found it and she was going to
return it when my man prevented her from doing so."I congratulate
you, Inspector," said Cyril, trying to speak superciliously."But you
omitted to mention the most important link in the chain of evidence you
have so cleverly forged against me," he continued."How am I supposed to
have got hold of this bag?I did not stop in Newhaven and you have had
me so closely watched that you must know that since my arrival in
England I have met no one who could have given it to me.""No, my lord, we are by no means sure of this.It is
true that we have, so to speak, kept an eye on you, but, till yesterday,
we had no reason to suspect that you had any connection with the murder,
so we did not think it necessary to have you closely followed.There
have been hours when we have had no idea where you were.""It is quite possible," continued the inspector without heeding Cyril's
interruption, "that you have met either Prentice or Lady Wilmersley, the
dowager, I mean."And why should they have given this bag to me, of all people?Surely you must see that they could have found many easier, as well as
safer, ways of disposing of it.""Quite so, my lord, and that is why I am inclined to believe that it was
not through either of them that the bag came into your possession.I
think it more probable that her Ladyship brought it with her.""You told me yourself that her Ladyship met you in Newhaven; that, in
fact, she had spent the night of the murder there."Cyril clutched the table convulsively.Why had it never
occurred to him that his lies might involve an innocent person?"But this is absurd, you know," he stammered, in a futile effort to gain
time."There has been a terrible mistake, I tell you.""In that case her Ladyship can no doubt easily explain it."But if you
wish it, I will not question her till she has been examined by our
doctors."Cyril rose and moved automatically towards the door."Sorry, my lord, but for the present you can see her Ladyship only
before witnesses."What is the use of asking my permission?You are master here, so it
seems," exclaimed Cyril.His nerves were at last getting beyond his
control."I am only doing my duty and I assure you that I want to cause as little
unpleasantness as possible.""Ask her Ladyship please to come here as soon as she can get ready.If
she is asleep, it will be necessary to wake her."The two men sat facing each other in silence.Cyril was hardly conscious of the other's presence.He must think; he
knew he must think; but his brain seemed paralysed.There must be a way
of clearing his wife without casting suspicion on Anita.Was it possible that he was now called upon to choose
between the woman he hated and the woman he loved, between honour and
dishonour?The door opened and Amy came slowly into the room.She was wrapped in a red velvet dressing-gown and its warm colour
contrasted painfully with the greyness of her face and lips.On catching
sight of the inspector, she started, but controlling herself with an
obvious effort, she turned to her husband."You can see for yourself, Inspector, that her Ladyship is in no
condition to be questioned," remonstrated Cyril, moving quickly to his
wife's side."Just as you say, my lord, but in that case her Ladyship had better
finish her dressing.It will be necessary for her to accompany me to
headquarters.""I will not allow it," cried Cyril, almost beside himself and throwing a
protecting arm around Amy's shoulders.Her bloodshot eyes rested a moment on her husband, then gently
disengaging herself, she drew herself to her full height and faced the
inspector."His Lordship----"

"Do not listen to his Lordship.It is I who demand to be told the
truth.""Amy, I beg you--" interposed Cyril."No, no," she cried, shaking off her husband's hand.Don't you see that you are torturing me?"It is all my fault," began Cyril."I am waiting to hear what the inspector has to say."Griggs cast a questioning look at Cyril, which the latter answered by a
helpless shrug."A bag has been found in his Lordship's chimney, which was lately
purchased in Newhaven.But perhaps before
answering, you may wish to consult your legal adviser.""I will neither acknowledge nor deny anything until I have seen this bag
and know of what I am accused," she answered after a barely perceptible
pause.Griggs opened the door and called:

"Jones, the bag, please."Had the moment come when he must proclaim the truth?"Am I supposed to have bought this bag?"It was sold to Prentice, who was sempstress at Geralton
and we believe it is the one in which Lady Wilmersley carried off her
jewels."Amy gave a muffled exclamation, but almost instantly she regained her
composure."If that is so, how do you connect me with it?Because it happens to
have been found here, do you accuse me of having robbed my cousin?""No, my lady, but as you spent the night of the murder in Newhaven----"

To Cyril's surprise she shuddered from head to foot.she cried, stretching out her hands as if to ward off a blow.His Lordship himself told me that you had
joined him there."It was not her Ladyship who was with me.Her Ladyship was in
Paris at the time.Thank God, thought Cyril, he had at last found
a way of saving both his love and his honour.Of a murder which was committed while you were
still in France--" asked Griggs, lifting his eyebrows incredulously.I mean I instigated it--I hated my cousin--I needed the money, so
I hired an accomplice.Of course, if you insist upon it, I shall have to
arrest you, but I don't believe you had anything more to do with the
murder than I had, and I would stake my reputation on your being as
straight a gentleman as I ever met professionally.Wait a bit, my lord,
don't be 'asty."In his excitement Griggs dropped one of his carefully
guarded aitches."You have arrived in the nick of time.Campbell cast a bewildered look at the inspector."His Lordship says that he hired an assassin to murder Lord Wilmersley.""He _shall_ believe me," cried Cyril."I alone am responsible for
Wilmersley's death.The person who actually fired the shot was nothing
but my tool.Really, Cyril, you are too ridiculous,"
exclaimed Campbell.Suddenly he caught sight of Amy, cowering in the shadow of the curtain.Cyril gave Guy a look
in which he tried to convey all that he did not dare to say.I told him you were engaged, but he says
he would like to speak to you most particular.""I don't want to see him," began Cyril."Don't be a greater fool than you can help," exclaimed Campbell."How do
you know that he has not some important news?"I took the liberty of forcing
myself upon you at this moment, my lord, because I have just learnt
certain facts which----"

"It is too late to report," interposed Cyril hastily."Why, my lord, what is the use of pretending that you had anything to do
with the murder?I hurried here to tell you that there is no further
need of your sacrificing yourself.I have found out who----"

"Shut up, I say.cried
Cyril incoherently."Don't listen to his Lordship," said Amy."We all know, of course, that
he is perfectly innocent.She
cast a keen look at Cyril."That's just it," Judson agreed.I convinced
his Lordship that Lord Wilmersley was murdered by his wife.I have come
here to tell him that I was mistaken.It is lucky that I discovered the
truth in time."His relief
was so intense that it robbed him of all power of concealment.Amy's mouth hardened into a straight, inflexible line; her eyes
narrowed."I suppose that you have some fact to support your extraordinary
assertion?"demanded Griggs, unable to hide his vexation at finding that
his rival had evidently outwitted him."Certainly, but I will say no more till I have his Lordship's
permission."I am more anxious than
any one to discover the truth.""Permit me to suggest, my lord, that it would be better if I could first
speak to you in private.""Nonsense," exclaimed Cyril impatiently."I am tired of this eternal
secrecy."Very well, only remember, I warned you.""Have you forgotten, my lord, that I told you I always had an idea that
those two Frenchmen who were staying at the Red Lion Inn, were somehow
implicated in the affair?""But what possible motive could they have had for murdering my cousin?"The detective's eyes appeared to wander aimlessly from one of his
auditors to another.She moved slowly forward, and leaning her arm on
the mantelpiece confronted the four men.The detective inclined his head and again turned towards Cyril."Having once discovered their identity, my lord, their motive was quite
apparent.""The elder," began Judson, speaking very slowly, "is Monsieur de
Brissac.For a moment Cyril was too stunned to speak.He could do nothing but
stare stupidly at the detective.He
hardly knew what he was saying.He only realised confusedly that
something within him was crying to him to save her.A wonderful light suddenly transfigured Amy's drawn face."Cyril, would you really do this for----"

"Hush!""I don't care now who knows the truth.Don't you see that she is not accountable for what
she is saying?"He had forgotten everything but that she
was a woman--his wife."I killed Lord Wilmersley," Amy repeated, as if he had not spoken, "but
I did not murder him.""Does your Ladyship expect us to believe that you happened to call at
the castle at half-past ten in the evening, and that during an amicable
conversation you accidentally shot Lord Wilmersley?""No," replied Amy contemptuously, "of course not!"If your Ladyship had not ulterior purpose in going to Newhaven, why did
you disguise yourself as a boy and live there under an assumed name?And
who is this Frenchman who posed as your brother?""Monsieur de Brissac was my lover.When we discovered that his Lordship
was employing detectives, we went to Newhaven, because we thought that
it was the last place where they would be likely to look for us.I
disguised myself to throw them off the scent.""But the description the inspector gave me of the boy did not resemble
you in the least," insisted Cyril.I merely cut off my hair and dyed it.She
snatched the black wig from her head, disclosing a short crop of reddish
curls."You have yet to explain," resumed the inspector sternly, "what took you
to Geralton in the middle of the night.Under the circumstances I should
have thought your Ladyship would hardly have cared to visit his
Lordship's relations."Ignoring Griggs, Amy turned to her husband."My going there was the purest accident," she began in a dull,
monotonous voice, almost as if she were reciting a lesson, but as she
proceeded, her excitement increased till finally she became so absorbed
in her story that she appeared to forget her hearers completely."I was
horribly restless, so we spent most of our time motoring and often
stayed out very late.I noticed that we had
stopped within a short walk of the castle.As I had never seen it except
at a distance, it occurred to me that I would like to have a nearer view
of the place.In my boy's clothes I found it fairly easy to climb the
low wall which separates the gardens from the park.Not a light was to
be seen, so, as there seemed no danger of my being discovered, I
ventured on to the terrace.As I stood there, I heard a faint cry.My
first impulse was to retrace my footsteps as quickly as possible, but
when I realised that it was a woman who was crying for help, I felt that
I must find out what was the matter.Running in the direction from which
the sound came, I turned a corner and found myself confronted by a
lighted window.The shrieks were now positively blood-curdling and there
was no doubt in my mind that some poor creature was being done to death
only a few feet away from me.The window was high above my head, but I
was determined to reach it.After several unsuccessful attempts I
managed to gain a foothold on the uneven surface of the wall and hoist
myself on to the window-sill.Luckily the window was partially open, so
I was able to slip noiselessly into the room and hide behind the
curtain.Peering through the folds, I saw a woman lying on the floor.Her bodice was torn open, exposing her bare back.Over her stood a man
who was beating her with a piece of cord which was attached to the waist
of a sort of Eastern dressing-gown he wore."'So you thought you would leave me, did you?'he cried over and over
again as the lash fell faster and faster.Not till I
send you to hell, which I will some day.'"At last he paused and wiped the perspiration from his brow.He was very
fat and his exertions were evidently telling on him.I have my pistol within reach of my
hand.Ah, you didn't know that, did you?'"The woman shuddered but made no attempt to rise."I was slowly recovering from the terror which had at first paralysed
me.I realised I must act at once if I meant to save Lady Wilmersley's
life."Dropping on my hands and knees, I crept cautiously toward it.'Kill
you, kill you, that is what I ought to do,' he kept repeating.No pistol was to be seen; yet I knew it was there.As I fumbled among his papers, my hand touched an ancient steel
gauntlet.Some instinct told me that I had found what I sought.But how
to open it was the question.Some agonising moments passed before I at
last accidentally pressed the spring and a pistol lay in my hand."He swung around and as he caught sight of the pistol levelled at his
head, the purple slowly faded from his face."Then seemingly reassured at finding that it was only a boy who
confronted him, he took a step forward.he blustered, but I noticed that his knees
shook and he made no further effort to move.There is a car waiting in the road,' I called
to the girl."I held him with my eye and saw his coward soul quiver with fear as I
moved deliberately nearer him."I knew rather than saw that she picked up a jacket and bag which lay
near the window.With a soft thud she dropped into the night.That is
the last I saw of her."As Lord Wilmersley saw his wife disappear, he gave a cry like a wounded
animal and rushed after her.He staggered back a few steps,
then turning he ran into the adjoining room.I heard a splash but did
not stop to find out what happened.Almost beside myself with terror, I
fled from the castle.If you have any more questions to ask, you had
better hurry."She stopped abruptly, trembling from head to foot, and glanced wildly
about her till her eyes rested on her husband.For a long, long moment
she regarded him in silence.She seemed to be gathering herself together
for a supreme effort.All four men watched her in breathless suspense.With her eyes still fastened on Cyril she fumbled in the bosom of her
dress, then her hand shot out, and before any one could prevent her, she
jabbed a hypodermic needle deep into her arm.cried Cyril, springing forward and wrenching the
needle from her.A beatific smile spread slowly over her face.She swayed a little and would have fallen if Cyril had not caught her."It is too late," she murmured.I--loved--you--so----"




CHAPTER XXII

CAMPBELL RESIGNS


Under a yew tree, overlooking a wide lawn, bordered on the farther side
by a bank of flowers, three people are sitting clustered around a
tea-table.One of them is a little old lady, the dearest old lady imaginable.By
her side, in a low basket chair, a girl is half sitting, half reclining.Her small figure, clad in a simple black frock, gives the impression of
extreme youth, which impression is heightened by the fact that her
curly, yellow hair, reaching barely to the nape of her neck, is caught
together by a black ribbon like a schoolgirl's.But when one looks more
closely into her pale face, one realises somehow that she is a woman and
a woman who has suffered--who still suffers.On the ground facing the younger woman a red-headed young man in white
flannels is squatting tailor-fashion.He is holding out an empty cup to
be refilled.exclaims the little old lady in a horrified tone."Why,
you have had three already!""My dear Trevie, let me inform you once and for all that I have
abandoned my figure.Why should I persist in the struggle now that Anita
refuses to smile on me?When one's heart is broken, one had better make
the most of the few pleasures one can still enjoy.Anita took no notice of his sally; her eyes were fixed on the distant
horizon; she seemed absorbed in her own thoughts."By the way," remarked Campbell casually as he sipped his tea, "I spent
last Sunday at Geralton."A faint flutter of
the eyelids was the only indication she gave of having heard him, yet
Guy was convinced that she was waiting breathlessly for him to continue.You would hardly
know it--the interior, I mean."Although he had pointedly addressed
Anita, she made no comment.It was only after a long silence that she
finally spoke.She plays all day long with the dolls Cyril bought for
her.Miss Trevor took up her knitting, which had been lying in her lap, and
was soon busy avoiding the pitfalls a heel presents to the unwary."I think I will go for a walk," said Anita, rising slowly from her seat.There was a hint of exasperation in her voice which escaped neither of
her hearers.Miss Trevor peered anxiously over her spectacles at the retreating
figure.Campbell's rubicund countenance had grown strangely grave.he asked as soon as Anita was out of earshot.Miss Trevor shook her head disconsolately.I can't imagine what can be the matter with her.She
seemed at one time to have recovered from her terrible experience.But
now, as you can see for yourself, she is absolutely wretched.She hardly eats enough to keep a bird alive.If
she goes on like this much longer, she will fret herself into her grave.Yet whenever I question her, she assures me that she is all right.I
really don't know what I ought to do.""Has it never occurred to you that she may be wondering why Wilmersley
has never written to her, nor been to see her?""She inquires after everybody
at Geralton except Cyril.Doesn't that strike you as very suspicious?""Oh, you don't mean that----"

He nodded.You told me yourself that she had only seen
him three or four times.""True, but you must remember that they met under very romantic
conditions.And Cyril is the sort of chap who would be likely to appeal
to a girl's imagination.""I wish I didn't," muttered Guy under his breath.She heard him, however, and laid her small, wrinkled hand tenderly on
his shoulder."My poor boy, I guessed your trouble long ago."It doesn't hurt any longer--not much at least.When one
realises a thing is quite hopeless, one somehow ends by adjusting
oneself to the inevitable.What I feel for her now is more worship than
love.I want above all things that she should be happy, and if Cyril can
make her so, I would gladly speed his wooing.""Do you think he has any thought of her?""Then why has he given no sign of life all these months?""I fancy he is waiting for the year of their mourning to elapse.But I
confess that I am surprised that he has been able to restrain his
impatience as long as this.Every day I have expected--"

"By Jove!"cried Campbell, springing to his feet, "there he is now!"Miss Trevor turned and saw a tall figure emerge from the house.Being plunged suddenly into the midst of romance, together with the
unexpected and dramatic arrival of the hero, was too much for the little
lady's composure.Her bag, her knitting, her glasses fell to the ground
unheeded as she rose hurriedly to receive Lord Wilmersley.Let me give you a cup of tea, or would you prefer
some whiskey and soda?"She was so flustered that she hardly knew what
she was saying.Rather fancied I
might run across you."Cyril's eyes strayed anxiously hither and thither.Cyril gave a start of guilty surprise."Yes, I was wondering where
she was.""She has gone for a little walk, but as she never leaves the grounds,
she can't be very far off," said Miss Trevor."Perhaps--" Cyril hesitated; he was painfully embarrassed."I will show you where you are likely to find
her."I did rather want to see her--ahem, on business!"jeered Campbell as he sauntered off.For a moment Cyril glared at Guy's back indignantly; then mumbling an
apology to Miss Trevor, he hastened after him.They had gone only a short distance before they espied a small,
black-robed figure coming towards them.Guy stopped short; he glanced at
Cyril, but the latter was no longer conscious of his presence.Without a
word he turned and hurriedly retraced his footsteps."Well, Trevie," he said, "I must be going.His manner was quite ostentatiously cheerful.Miss Trevor, however, was not deceived by it."You are a dear,
courageous boy," she murmured.With a flourish of his hat that seemed to repudiate all sympathy, Guy
turned on his heel and marched gallantly away.Meanwhile, in another part of the garden, a very different scene was
being enacted.On catching sight of each other Cyril and Anita had both halted
simultaneously.Cyril's heart pounded so violently that he could hardly
hear himself think."I must be calm," he said to himself.If I only had a little more time to collect my wits!I know I
shall make an ass of myself!"As these thoughts went racing through his brain, he had been moving
almost automatically forward.Already he could distinguish the soft
curve of her parted lips and the colour of her dilated eyes.He was conscious of a wild desire to fly from
her presence; but it was too late.For a moment neither moved, but under the insistence of his gaze her
eyes slowly sank before his.Then, without a word, as one who merely
claims his own, he flung his arms around her and crushed her to his
heart.THE END

straightforward story of life and love in a romantic setting."--_The
Literary Digest._

_Nearly One Million copies of Mrs.In the majority of cases transportation is
impossible, so disproportioned is the burden to the motive-power.A
slight displacement, caused by the effort of the insects' backs, is all
that can possibly be effected.Ammophilus and Cerceris, Sphex and Pompilus excavate their burrows
wherever they please; they carry their prey thither on the wing, or, if
too heavy, drag it afoot.The Necrophorus knows no such facilities in
his task.Incapable of carrying the monstrous corpse, no matter where
encountered, he is forced to dig the grave where the body lies.This obligatory place of sepulture may be in stony soil; it may occupy
this or that bare spot, or some other where the grass, especially the
couch-grass, plunges into the ground its inextricable network of little
cords.There is a great probability, too, that a bristle of stunted
brambles may support the body at some inches from the soil.Slung by
the labourers' spade, which has just broken his back, the Mole falls
here, there, anywhere, at random; and where the body falls, no matter
what the obstacles--provided they be not insurmountable--there the
undertaker must utilize it.The difficulties of inhumation are capable of such variety as causes us
already to foresee that the Necrophorus cannot employ fixed methods in
the accomplishment of his labours.Exposed to fortuitous hazards, he
must be able to modify his tactics within the limits of his modest
perceptions.To saw, to break, to disentangle, to lift, to shake, to
displace: these are so many methods of procedure which are
indispensable to the grave-digger in a predicament.Deprived of these
resources, reduced to uniformity of method, the insect would be
incapable of pursuing the calling which has fallen to its lot.We see at once how imprudent it would be to draw conclusions from an
isolated case in which rational coordination or premeditated intention
might appear to intervene.Every instinctive action no doubt has its
motive; but does the animal in the first place judge whether the action
is opportune?Let us begin by a careful consideration of the creature's
labours; let us support each piece of evidence by others; and then we
shall be able to answer the question.First of all, a word as to diet.A general scavenger, the
Burying-beetle refuses nothing in the way of cadaveric putridity.All
is good to his senses, feathered game or furry, provided that the
burden do not exceed his strength.He exploits the batrachian or the
reptile with no less animation, he accepts without hesitation
extraordinary finds, probably unknown to his race, as witness a certain
Gold-fish, a red Chinese Carp, whose body, placed in one of my cages,
was instantly considered an excellent tit-bit and buried according to
the rules.A mutton-cutlet, a strip of
beefsteak, in the right stage of maturity, disappeared beneath the
soil, receiving the same attention as those which were lavished on the
Mole or the Mouse.In short, the Necrophorus has no exclusive
preferences; anything putrid he conveys underground.The maintenance of his industry, therefore, presents no sort of
difficulty.If one kind of game be lacking, some other--the first to
hand--will very well replace it.Neither is there much trouble in
establishing the site of his industry.A capacious dish-cover of wire
gauze is sufficient, resting on an earthen pan filled to the brim with
fresh, heaped sand.To obviate criminal attempts on the part of the
Cats, whom the game would not fail to tempt, the cage is installed in a
closed room with glazed windows, which in winter is the refuge of the
plants and in summer an entomological laboratory.The Mole lies in the centre of the enclosure.The soil,
easily shifted and homogeneous, realizes the best conditions for
comfortable work.Four Necrophori, three males and a female, are there
with the body.They remain invisible, hidden beneath the carcass, which
from time to time seems to return to life, shaken from end to end by
the backs of the workers.An observer not in the secret would be
somewhat astonished to see the dead creature move.From time to time,
one of the sextons, almost always a male, emerges and goes the rounds
of the animal, which he explores, probing its velvet coat.He hurriedly
returns, appears again, once more investigates and creeps back under
the corpse.The tremors become more pronounced; the carcass oscillates, while a
cushion of sand, pushed outward from below, grows up all about it.The
Mole, by reason of his own weight and the efforts of the grave-diggers,
who are labouring at their task beneath him, gradually sinks, for lack
of support, into the undermined soil.Presently the sand which has been pushed outward quivers under the
thrust of the invisible miners, slips into the pit and covers the
interred Mole.The body seems to disappear
of itself, as though engulfed by a fluid medium.For a long time yet,
until the depth is regarded as sufficient, the body will continue to
descend.It is, when all is taken into account, a very simple operation.As the
diggers, underneath the corpse, deepen the cavity into which it sinks,
tugged and shaken by the sextons, the grave, without their
intervention, fills of itself by the mere downfall of the shaken soil.Useful shovels at the tips of their claws, powerful backs, capable of
creating a little earthquake: the diggers need nothing more for the
practice of their profession.Let us add--for this is an essential
point--the art of continually jerking and shaking the body, so as to
pack it into a lesser volume and cause it to pass when passage is
obstructed.We shall presently see that this art plays a part of the
greatest importance in the industry of the Necrophori.Although he has disappeared, the Mole is still far from having reached
his destination.Let us leave the undertakers to complete their task.What they are now doing below ground is a continuation of what they did
on the surface and would teach us nothing new.We will wait for two or
three days.Let us inform ourselves of what is happening down
there.Let us visit the retting-vat.I shall invite no one to be
present at the exhumation.Of those about me, only little Paul has the
courage to assist me.The Mole is a Mole no longer, but a greenish horror, putrid, hairless,
shrunk into a round, greasy mass.The thing must have undergone careful
manipulation to be thus condensed into a small volume, like a fowl in
the hands of the cook, and, above all, to be so completely deprived of
its fur.Is this culinary procedure undertaken in respect of the
larvae, which might be incommoded by the fur?Or is it just a casual
result, a mere loss of hair due to putridity?But it
is always the case that these exhumations, from first to last, have
revealed the furry game furless and the feathered game featherless,
except for the tail-feathers and the pinion-feathers of the wings.Reptiles and fish, on the other hand, retain their scales.Let us return to the unrecognizable thing which was once a Mole.The
tit-bit lies in a spacious crypt, with firm walls, a regular workshop,
worthy of being the bake-house of a Copris-beetle.Except for the fur,
which is lying in scattered flocks, it is intact.The grave-diggers
have not eaten into it; it is the patrimony of the sons, not the
provision of the parents, who, in order to sustain themselves, levy at
most a few mouthfuls of the ooze of putrid humours.Beside the dish which they are kneading and protecting are two
Necrophori; a couple, no more.What
has become of the other two, both males?I find them hidden in the
soil, at a distance, almost at the surface.Whenever I am present at a
burial undertaken by a squad in which the males, zealous one and all,
predominate, I find presently, when the burial is completed, only one
couple in the mortuary cellar.Having lent their assistance, the rest
have discreetly retired.These grave-diggers, in truth, are remarkable fathers.They have
nothing of the happy-go-lucky paternal carelessness that is the general
rule among insects, which plague and pester the mother for a moment
with their attentions and thereupon leave her to care for the
offspring!But those who in the other races are unemployed in this case
labour valiantly, now in the interest of their own family, now for the
sake of another's, without distinction.If a couple is in difficulties,
helpers arrive, attracted by the odour of carrion; anxious to serve a
lady, they creep under the body, work at it with back and claw, bury it
and then go their ways, leaving the householders to their happiness.For some time longer these latter manipulate the morsel in concert,
stripping it of fur or feather, trussing it and allowing it to simmer
to the taste of the larvae.When all is in order, the couple go forth,
dissolving their partnership, and each, following his fancy,
recommences elsewhere, even if only as a mere auxiliary.Twice and no oftener hitherto have I found the father preoccupied by
the future of his sons and labouring in order to leave them rich: it
happens with certain Dung-beetles and with the Necrophori, who bury
dead bodies.Scavengers and undertakers both have exemplary morals.Who
would look for virtue in such a quarter?What follows--the larval existence and the metamorphosis--is a
secondary detail and, for that matter, familiar.It is a dry subject
and I shall deal with it briefly.About the end of May, I exhume a
Brown Rat, buried by the grave-diggers a fortnight earlier.Transformed
into a black, sticky jelly, the horrible dish provides me with fifteen
larvae, already, for the most part, of the normal size.A few adults,
connections, assuredly, of the brood, are also stirring amid the
infected mass.The period of hatching is over now; and food is
plentiful.Having nothing else to do, the foster-parents have sat down
to the feast with the nurselings.The undertakers are quick at rearing a family.It is at most a
fortnight since the Rat was laid in the earth; and here already is a
vigorous population on the verge of the metamorphosis.It would seem as though the liquefaction of carrion, deadly
to any other stomach, is in this case a food productive of especial
energy, which stimulates the organism and accelerates its growth, so
that the victuals may be consumed before its approaching conversion
into mould.Living chemistry makes haste to outstrip the ultimate
reactions of mineral chemistry.White, naked, blind, possessing the habitual attributes of life in
darkness, the larva, with its lanceolate outline, is slightly
reminiscent of the grub of the Ground-beetle.The mandibles are black
and powerful, making excellent scissors for dissection.The limbs are
short, but capable of a quick, toddling gait.The segments of the
abdomen are armoured on the upper surface with a narrow reddish plate,
armed with four tiny spikes, whose office apparently is to furnish
points of support when the larva quits the natal dwelling and dives
into the soil, there to undergo the transformation.The thoracic
segments are provided with wider plates, but unarmed.The adults discovered in the company of their larval family, in this
putridity that was a Rat, are all abominably verminous.So shiny and
neat in their attire, when at work under the first Moles of April, the
Necrophori, when June approaches, become odious to look upon.A layer
of parasites envelops them; insinuating itself into the joints, it
forms an almost continuous surface.The insect presents a misshapen
appearance under this overcoat of vermin, which my hair-pencil can
hardly brush aside.Driven off the belly, the horde make the tour of
the sufferer and encamp on his back, refusing to relinquish their hold.I recognize among them the Beetle's Gamasis, the Tick who so often
soils the ventral amethyst of our Geotrupes.No; the prizes of life do
not fall to the share of the useful.Necrophori and Geotrupes devote
themselves to works of general salubrity; and these two corporations,
so interesting in the accomplishment of their hygienic functions, so
remarkable for their domestic morality, are given over to the vermin of
poverty.Alas, of this discrepancy between the services rendered and
the harshness of life there are many other examples outside the world
of scavengers and undertakers!The Burying-beetles display an exemplary domestic morality, but it does
not persist until the end.During the first fortnight of June, the
family being sufficiently provided for, the sextons strike work and my
cages are deserted, so far as the surface is concerned, in spite of new
arrivals of Mice and Sparrows.From time to time some grave-digger
leaves the subsoil and comes crawling languidly in the fresh air.All, as soon as
they emerge from underground, are <DW36>s, whose limbs have been
amputated at the joints, some higher up, some lower down.I see one
mutilated Beetle who has only one leg left entire.With this odd limb
and the stumps of the others lamentably tattered, scaly with vermin, he
rows himself, as it were, over the dusty surface.A comrade emerges,
one better off for legs, who finishes the <DW36> and cleans out his
abdomen.So my thirteen remaining Necrophori end their days,
half-devoured by their companions, or at least shorn of several limbs.The pacific relations of the outset are succeeded by cannibalism.History tells us that certain peoples, the Massagetae and others, used
to kill their aged folk in order to spare them the miseries of
senility.The fatal blow on the hoary skull was in their eyes an act of
filial piety.The Necrophori have their share of these ancient
barbarities.Full of days and henceforth useless, dragging out a weary
existence, they mutually exterminate one another.Why prolong the agony
of the impotent and the imbecile?The Massagetae might invoke, as an excuse for their atrocious custom, a
dearth of provisions, which is an evil counsellor; not so the
Necrophori, for, thanks to my generosity, victuals are superabundant,
both beneath the soil and on the surface.Famine plays no part in this
slaughter.Here we have the aberration of exhaustion, the morbid fury
of a life on the point of extinction.As is generally the case, work
bestows a peaceable disposition on the grave-digger, while inaction
inspires him with perverted tastes.Having no longer anything to do, he
breaks his fellow's limbs, eats him up, heedless of being mutilated or
eaten up himself.This is the ultimate deliverance of verminous old
age.THE BURYING-BEETLES: EXPERIMENTS.Let us proceed to the rational prowess which has earned for the
Necrophorus the better part of his renown and, to begin with, let us
submit the case related by Clairville--that of the too hard soil and
the call for assistance--to experimental test.With this object in view, I pave the centre of the space beneath the
cover, level with the soil, with a brick and sprinkle the latter with a
thin layer of sand.This will be the soil in which digging is
impracticable.All about it, for some distance and on the same level,
spreads the loose soil, which is easy to dig.In order to approximate to the conditions of the little story, I must
have a Mouse; with a Mole, a heavy mass, the work of removal would
perhaps present too much difficulty.To obtain the Mouse I place my
friends and neighbours under requisition; they laugh at my whim but
none the less proffer their traps.Yet, the moment a Mouse is needed,
that very common animal becomes rare.Braving decorum in his speech,
which follows the Latin of his ancestors, the Provencal says, but even
more crudely than in my translation: "If you look for dung, the Asses
become constipated!"At last I possess the Mouse of my dreams!She comes to me from that
refuge, furnished with a truss of straw, in which official charity
gives the hospitality of a day to the beggar wandering over the face of
the fertile earth; from that municipal hostel whence one invariably
emerges verminous.O Reaumur, who used to invite marquises to see your
caterpillars change their skins, what would you have said of a future
disciple conversant with such wretchedness as this?Perhaps it is well
that we should not be ignorant of it, so that we may take compassion on
the sufferings of beasts.I place her upon the centre of
the brick.The grave-diggers under the wire cover are now seven in
number, of whom three are females.All have gone to earth: some are
inactive, close to the surface; the rest are busy in their crypts.The
presence of the fresh corpse is promptly perceived.About seven o'clock
in the morning, three Necrophori hurry up, two males and a female.They
slip under the Mouse, who moves in jerks, a sign of the efforts of the
burying-party.An attempt is made to dig into the layer of sand which
hides the brick, so that a bank of sand accumulates about the body.For a couple of hours the jerks continue without results.I profit by
the circumstance to investigate the manner in which the work is
performed.The bare brick allows me to see what the excavated soil
concealed from me.If it is necessary to move the body, the Beetle
turns over; with his six claws he grips the hair of the dead animal,
props himself upon his back and pushes, making a lever of his head and
the tip of his abdomen.If digging is required, he resumes the normal
position.So, turn and turn about, the sexton strives, now with his
claws in the air, when it is a question of shifting the body or
dragging it lower down; now with his feet on the ground, when it is
necessary to deepen the grave.The point at which the Mouse lies is finally recognized as
unassailable.He explores the specimen,
goes the round of it, scratches a little at random.He goes back; and
immediately the body rocks.Is he advising his collaborators of what he
has discovered?Is he arranging matters with a view to their
establishing themselves elsewhere, on propitious soil?When he shakes the body,
the others imitate him and push, but without combining their efforts in
a given direction, for, after advancing a little towards the edge of
the brick, the burden goes back again, returning to the point of
departure.In the absence of any concerted understanding, their efforts
of leverage are wasted.Nearly three hours are occupied by oscillations
which mutually annul one another.The Mouse does not cross the little
sand-hill heaped about it by the rakes of the workers.For the second time a male emerges and makes a round of exploration.A
bore is made in workable earth, close beside the brick.This is a trial
excavation, to reveal the nature of the soil; a narrow well, of no
great depth, into which the insect plunges to half its length.The
well-sinker returns to the other workers, who arch their backs, and the
load progresses a finger's-breadth towards the point recognized as
favourable.No, for after a while
the Mouse recoils.Now two males come out in search of information, each of his own
accord.Instead of stopping at the point already sounded, a point most
judiciously chosen, it seemed, on account of its proximity, which would
save laborious transportation, they precipitately scour the whole area
of the cage, sounding the soil on this side and on that and ploughing
superficial furrows in it.They get as far from the brick as the limits
of the enclosure permit.They dig, by preference, against the base of the cover; here they make
several borings, without any reason, so far as I can see, the bed of
soil being everywhere equally assailable away from the brick; the first
point sounded is abandoned for a second, which is rejected in its turn.A third and a fourth are tried; then another and yet another.At the
sixth point the selection is made.In all these cases the excavation is
by no means a grave destined to receive the Mouse, but a mere trial
boring, of inconsiderable depth, its diameter being that of the
digger's body.A return is made to the Mouse, who suddenly quivers, oscillates,
advances, recoils, first in one direction, then in another, until in
the end the little hillock of sand is crossed.Now we are free of the
brick and on excellent soil.This
is no cartage by a team hauling in the open, but a jerky displacement,
the work of invisible levers.The body seems to move of its own accord.This time, after so many hesitations, their efforts are concerted; at
all events, the load reaches the region sounded far more rapidly than I
expected.Then begins the burial, according to the usual method.The Necrophori have allowed the hour-hand of the clock to
go half round the dial while verifying the condition of the surrounding
spots and displacing the Mouse.In this experiment it appears at the outset that the males play a major
part in the affairs of the household.Better-equipped, perhaps, than
their mates, they make investigations when a difficulty occurs; they
inspect the soil, recognize whence the check arises and choose the
point at which the grave shall be made.In the lengthy experiment of
the brick, the two males alone explored the surroundings and set to
work to solve the difficulty.Confiding in their assistance, the
female, motionless beneath the Mouse, awaited the result of their
investigations.The tests which are to follow will confirm the merits
of these valiant auxiliaries.In the second place, the point where the Mouse lay being recognized as
presenting an insurmountable resistance, there was no grave dug in
advance, a little farther off, in the light soil.All attempts were
limited, I repeat, to shallow soundings which informed the insect of
the possibility of inhumation.It is absolute nonsense to speak of their first preparing the grave to
which the body will afterwards be carted.To excavate the soil, our
grave-diggers must feel the weight of their dead on their backs.They
work only when stimulated by the contact of its fur.Never, never in
this world do they venture to dig a grave unless the body to be buried
already occupies the site of the cavity.This is absolutely confirmed
by my two and a half months and more of daily observations.The rest of Clairville's anecdote bears examination no better.We are
told that the Necrophorus in difficulties goes in search of assistance
and returns with companions who assist him to bury the Mouse.This, in
another form, is the edifying story of the Sacred Beetle whose pellet
had rolled into a rut, powerless to withdraw his treasure from the
gulf, the wily Dung-beetle called together three or four of his
neighbours, who benevolently recovered the pellet, returning to their
labours after the work of salvage.The exploit--so ill-interpreted--of the thieving pill-roller sets me on
my guard against that of the undertaker.Shall I be too exigent if I
enquire what precautions the observer adopted to recognize the owner of
the Mouse on his return, when he reappears, as we are told, with four
assistants?What sign denotes that one of the five who was able, in so
rational a manner, to appeal for help?Can one even be sure that the
one to disappear returns and forms one of the band?There is nothing to
indicate it; and this was the essential point which a sterling observer
was bound not to neglect.Were they not rather five chance Necrophori
who, guided by the smell, without any previous understanding, hastened
to the abandoned Mouse to exploit her on their own account?I incline
to this opinion, the most likely of all in the absence of exact
information.Probability becomes certainty if we submit the case to the verification
of experiment.The test with the brick already gives us some
information.For six hours my three specimens exhausted themselves in
efforts before they got to the length of removing their booty and
placing it on practicable soil.In this long and heavy task helpful
neighbours would have been anything but unwelcome.Four other
Necrophori, buried here and there under a little sand, comrades and
acquaintances, helpers of the day before, were occupying the same cage;
and not one of those concerned thought of summoning them to give
assistance.Despite their extreme embarrassment, the owners of the
Mouse accomplished their task to the end, without the least help,
though this could have been so easily requisitioned.Being three, one might say, they considered themselves sufficiently
strong; they needed no one else to lend them a hand.On many occasions and under conditions even more
difficult than those presented by a stony soil, I have again and again
seen isolated Necrophori exhausting themselves in striving against my
artifices; yet not once did they leave their work to recruit helpers.Collaborators, it is true, did often arrive, but they were convoked by
their sense of smell, not by the first possessor.They were fortuitous
helpers; they were never called in.They were welcomed without
disagreement, but also without gratitude.They were not summoned; they
were tolerated.In the glazed shelter where I keep the cage I happened
to catch one of these chance assistants in the act.Passing that way in
the night and scenting dead flesh, he had entered where none of his
kind had yet penetrated of his own free will.I surprised him on the
wire-gauze dome of the cover.If the wire had not prevented him, he
would have set to work incontinently, in company with the rest.He had hastened thither attracted
by the odour of the Mole, heedless of the efforts of others.So it was
with those whose obliging assistance is extolled.I repeat, in respect
of their imaginary prowess, what I have said elsewhere of that of the
Sacred Beetles: the story is a childish one, worthy of ranking with any
fairy-tale written for the amusement of the simple.A hard soil, necessitating the removal of the body, is not the only
difficulty familiar to the Necrophori.Often, perhaps more often than
not, the ground is covered with grass, above all with couch-grass,
whose tenacious rootlets form an inextricable network below the
surface.To dig in the interstices is possible, but to drag the dead
animal through them is another matter: the meshes of the net are too
close to give it passage.Will the grave-digger find himself reduced to
impotence by such an impediment, which must be an extremely common one?Exposed to this or that habitual obstacle in the exercise of his
calling, the animal is always equipped accordingly; otherwise his
profession would be impracticable.No end is attained without the
necessary means and aptitudes.Besides that of the excavator, the
Necrophorus certainly possesses another art: the art of breaking the
cables, the roots, the stolons, the slender rhizomes which check the
body's descent into the grave.To the work of the shovel and the pick
must be added that of the shears.All this is perfectly logical and may
be foreseen with complete lucidity.Nevertheless, let us invoke
experiment, the best of witnesses.I borrow from the kitchen-range an iron trivet whose legs will supply a
solid foundation for the engine which I am devising.This is a coarse
network of strips of raphia, a fairly accurate imitation of the network
of couch-grass roots.The very irregular meshes are nowhere wide enough
to admit of the passage of the creature to be buried, which in this
case is a Mole.The trivet is planted with its three feet in the soil
of the cage; its top is level with the surface of the soil.The Mole is placed in the centre; and my
squad of sextons is let loose upon the body.Without a hitch the burial is accomplished in the course of an
afternoon.The hammock of raphia, almost equivalent to the natural
network of couch-grass turf, scarcely disturbs the process of
inhumation.Matters do not go forward quite so quickly; and that is
all.No attempt is made to shift the Mole, who sinks into the ground
where he lies.The operation completed, I remove the trivet.The
network is broken at the spot where the corpse lay.A few strips have
been gnawed through; a small number, only so many as were strictly
necessary to permit the passage of the body.I expected no less of your savoir-faire.You
have foiled the artifices of the experimenter by employing your
resources against natural obstacles.With mandibles for shears, you
have patiently cut my threads as you would have gnawed the cordage of
the grass-roots.This is meritorious, if not deserving of exceptional
glorification.The most limited of the insects which work in earth
would have done as much if subjected to similar conditions.Let us ascend a stage in the series of difficulties.The Mole is now
fixed with a lashing of raphia fore and aft to a light horizontal
cross-bar which rests on two firmly-planted forks.It is like a joint
of venison on a spit, though rather oddly fastened.The dead animal
touches the ground throughout the length of its body.The Necrophori disappear under the corpse, and, feeling the contact of
its fur, begin to dig.The grave grows deeper and an empty space
appears, but the coveted object does not descend, retained as it is by
the cross-bar which the two forks keep in place.The digging slackens,
the hesitations become prolonged.However, one of the grave-diggers ascends to the surface, wanders over
the Mole, inspects him and ends by perceiving the hinder strap.Tenaciously he gnaws and ravels it.I hear the click of the shears that
completes the rupture.Dragged down by his
own weight, the Mole sinks into the grave, but slantwise, with his head
still outside, kept in place by the second ligature.The Beetles proceed to the burial of the hinder part of the Mole; they
twitch and jerk it now in this direction, now in that.Nothing comes of
it; the thing refuses to give.A fresh sortie is made by one of them to
discover what is happening overhead.The second ligature is perceived,
is severed in turn, and henceforth the work proceeds as well as could
be desired.My compliments, perspicacious cable-cutters!The lashings of the Mole were for you the little cords with which you
are so familiar in turfy soil.You have severed them, as well as the
hammock of the previous experiment, just as you sever with the blades
of your shears any natural filament which stretches across your
catacombs.It is, in your calling, an indispensable knack.If you had
had to learn it by experience, to think it out before practising it,
your race would have disappeared, killed by the hesitations of its
apprenticeship, for the spots fertile in Moles, Frogs, Lizards and
other victuals to your taste are usually grass-covered.You are capable of far better things yet; but, before proceeding to
these, let us examine the case when the ground bristles with slender
brushwood, which holds the corpse at a short distance from the ground.Will the find thus suspended by the hazard of its fall remain
unemployed?Will the Necrophori pass on, indifferent to the superb
tit-bit which they see and smell a few inches above their heads, or
will they make it descend from its gibbet?Game does not abound to such a point that it can be disdained if a few
efforts will obtain it.Before I see the thing happen I am persuaded
that it will fall, that the Necrophori, often confronted by the
difficulties of a body which is not lying on the soil, must possess the
instinct to shake it to the ground.The fortuitous support of a few
bits of stubble, of a few interlaced brambles, a thing so common in the
fields, should not be able to baffle them.The overthrow of the
suspended body, if placed too high, should certainly form part of their
instinctive methods.For the rest, let us watch them at work.I plant in the sand of the cage a meagre tuft of thyme.The shrub is at
most some four inches in height.In the branches I place a Mouse,
entangling the tail, the paws and the neck among the twigs in order to
increase the difficulty.The population of the cage now consists of
fourteen Necrophori and will remain the same until the close of my
investigations.Of course they do not all take part simultaneously in
the day's work; the majority remain underground, somnolent, or occupied
in setting their cellars in order.Sometimes only one, often two, three
or four, rarely more, busy themselves with the dead creature which I
offer them.To-day two hasten to the Mouse, who is soon perceived
overhead in the tuft of thyme.They gain the summit of the plant by way of the wire trellis of the
cage.Here are repeated, with increased hesitation, due to the
inconvenient nature of the support, the tactics employed to remove the
body when the soil is unfavourable.The insect props itself against a
branch, thrusting alternately with back and claws, jerking and shaking
vigorously until the point where at it is working is freed from its
fetters.In one brief shift, by dint of heaving their backs, the two
collaborators extricate the body from the entanglement of twigs.Yet
another shake; and the Mouse is down.There is nothing new in this experiment; the find has been dealt with
just as though it lay upon soil unsuitable for burial.The fall is the
result of an attempt to transport the load.The time has come to set up the Frog's gibbet celebrated by Gledditsch.The batrachian is not indispensable; a Mole will serve as well or even
better.With a ligament of raphia I fix him, by his hind-legs, to a
twig which I plant vertically in the ground, inserting it to no great
depth.The creature hangs plumb against the gibbet, its head and
shoulders making ample contact with the soil.The gravediggers set to work beneath the part which lies upon the
ground, at the very foot of the stake; they dig a funnel-shaped hole,
into which the muzzle, the head and the neck of the mole sink little by
little.The gibbet becomes uprooted as they sink and eventually falls,
dragged over by the weight of its heavy burden.I am assisting at the
spectacle of the overturned stake, one of the most astonishing examples
of rational accomplishment which has ever been recorded to the credit
of the insect.This, for one who is considering the problem of instinct, is an
exciting moment.But let us beware of forming conclusions as yet; we
might be in too great a hurry.Let us ask ourselves first whether the
fall of the stake was intentional or fortuitous.Did the Necrophori lay
it bare with the express intention of causing it to fall?Or did they,
on the contrary, dig at its base solely in order to bury that part of
the mole which lay on the ground?that is the question, which, for the
rest, is very easy to answer.The experiment is repeated; but this time the gibbet is slanting and
the Mole, hanging in a vertical position, touches the ground at a
couple of inches from the base of the gibbet.Under these conditions
absolutely no attempt is made to overthrow the latter.Not the least
scrape of a claw is delivered at the foot of the gibbet.The entire
work of excavation is accomplished at a distance, under the body, whose
shoulders are lying on the ground.There--and there only--a hole is dug
to receive the free portion of the body, the part accessible to the
sextons.A difference of an inch in the position of the suspended animal
annihilates the famous legend.Even so, many a time, the most
elementary sieve, handled with a little logic, is enough to winnow the
confused mass of affirmations and to release the good grain of truth.The gibbet is oblique or vertical
indifferently; but the Mole, always fixed by a hinder limb to the top
of the twig, does not touch the soil; he hangs a few fingers'-breadths
from the ground, out of the sextons' reach.Will they scrape at the foot of the gibbet in
order to overturn it?By no means; and the ingenuous observer who
looked for such tactics would be greatly disappointed.No attention is
paid to the base of the support.It is not vouchsafed even a stroke of
the rake.Nothing is done to overturn it, nothing, absolutely nothing!It is by other methods that the Burying-beetles obtain the Mole.These decisive experiments, repeated under many different forms, prove
that never, never in this world do the Necrophori dig, or even give a
superficial scrape, at the foot of the gallows, unless the hanging body
touch the ground at that point.And, in the latter case, if the twig
should happen to fall, its fall is in nowise an intentional result, but
a mere fortuitous effect of the burial already commenced.What, then, did the owner of the Frog of whom Gledditsch tells us
really see?If his stick was overturned, the body placed to dry beyond
the assaults of the Necrophori must certainly have touched the soil: a
strange precaution against robbers and the damp!We may fittingly
attribute more foresight to the preparer of dried Frogs and allow him
to hang the creature some inches from the ground.In this case all my
experiments emphatically assert that the fall of the stake undermined
by the sextons is a pure matter of imagination.Yet another of the fine arguments in favour of the reasoning power of
animals flies from the light of investigation and founders in the
slough of error!I admire your simple faith, you masters who take
seriously the statements of chance-met observers, richer in imagination
than in veracity; I admire your credulous zeal, when, without
criticism, you build up your theories on such absurdities.The stake is henceforth planted vertically, but the
body hanging on it does not reach the base: a condition which suffices
to ensure that there is never any digging at this point.I make use of
a Mouse, who, by reason of her trifling weight, will lend herself
better to the insect's manoeuvres.The dead body is fixed by the
hind-legs to the top of the stake with a ligature of raphia.It hangs
plumb, in contact with the stick.Very soon two Necrophori have discovered the tit-bit.They climb up the
miniature mast; they explore the body, dividing its fur by thrusts of
the head.Here we
have again, but under far more difficult conditions, the tactics
employed when it was necessary to displace the unfavourably situated
body: the two collaborators slip between the Mouse and the stake, when,
taking a grip of the latter and exerting a leverage with their backs,
they jerk and shake the body, which oscillates, twirls about, swings
away from the stake and relapses.All the morning is passed in vain
attempts, interrupted by explorations on the animal's body.In the afternoon the cause of the check is at last recognized; not very
clearly, for in the first place the two obstinate riflers of the
gallows attack the hind-legs of the Mouse, a little below the ligature.They strip them bare, flay them and cut away the flesh about the heel.They have reached the bone, when one of them finds the raphia beneath
his mandibles.This, to him, is a familiar thing, representing the
gramineous fibre so frequent in the case of burial in grass-covered
soil.Tenaciously the shears gnaw at the bond; the vegetable fetter is
severed and the Mouse falls, to be buried a little later.If it were isolated, this severance of the suspending tie would be a
magnificent performance; but considered in connection with the sum of
the Beetle's customary labours it loses all far-reaching significance.Before attacking the ligature, which was not concealed in any way, the
insect exerted itself for a whole morning in shaking the body, its
usual method.Finally, finding the cord, it severed it, as it would
have severed a ligament of couch-grass encountered underground.Under the conditions devised for the Beetle, the use of the shears is
the indispensable complement of the use of the shovel; and the modicum
of discernment at his disposal is enough to inform him when the blades
of his shears will be useful.He cuts what embarrasses him with no more
exercise of reason than he displays when placing the corpse
underground.So little does he grasp the connection between cause and
effect that he strives to break the bone of the leg before gnawing at
the bast which is knotted close beside him.The difficult task is
attacked before the extremely simple.Difficult, yes, but not impossible, provided that the Mouse be young.I
begin again with a ligature of iron wire, on which the shears of the
insect can obtain no purchase, and a tender Mouselet, half the size of
an adult.This time a tibia is gnawed through, cut in two by the
Beetle's mandibles near the spring of the heel.The detached member
leaves plenty of space for the other, which readily slips from the
metallic band; and the little body falls to the ground.But, if the bone be too hard, if the body suspended be that of a Mole,
an adult Mouse, or a Sparrow, the wire ligament opposes an
insurmountable obstacle to the attempts of the Necrophori, who, for
nearly a week, work at the hanging body, partly stripping it of fur or
feather and dishevelling it until it forms a lamentable object, and at
last abandon it, when desiccation sets in.A last resource, however,
remains, one as rational as infallible.Of course, not one dreams of doing so.For the last time let us change our artifices.The top of the gibbet
consists of a little fork, with the prongs widely opened and measuring
barely two-fifths of an inch in length.With a thread of hemp, less
easily attacked than a strip of raphia, I bind together, a little above
the heels, the hind-legs of an adult Mouse; and between the legs I slip
one of the prongs of the fork.To make the body fall it is enough to
slide it a little way upwards; it is like a young Rabbit hanging in the
front of a poulterer's shop.Five Necrophori come to inspect my preparations.After a great deal of
futile shaking, the tibiae are attacked.This, it seems, is the method
usually employed when the body is retained by one of its limbs in some
narrow fork of a low-growing plant.While trying to saw through the
bone--a heavy job this time--one of the workers slips between the
shackled limbs.So situated, he feels against his back the furry touch
of the Mouse.Nothing more is needed to arouse his propensity to thrust
with his back.With a few heaves of the lever the thing is done; the
Mouse rises a little, slides over the supporting peg and falls to the
ground.Has the insect indeed perceived,
by the light of a flash of reason, that in order to make the tit-bit
fall it was necessary to unhook it by sliding it along the peg?Has it
really perceived the mechanism of suspension?I know some
persons--indeed, I know many--who, in the presence of this magnificent
result, would be satisfied without further investigation.More difficult to convince, I modify the experiment before drawing a
conclusion.I suspect that the Necrophorus, without any prevision of
the consequences of his action, heaved his back simply because he felt
the legs of the creature above him.With the system of suspension
adopted, the push of the back, employed in all cases of difficulty, was
brought to bear first upon the point of support; and the fall resulted
from this happy coincidence.That point, which has to be slipped along
the peg in order to unhook the object, ought really to be situated at a
short distance from the Mouse, so that the Necrophori shall no longer
feel her directly against their backs when they push.A piece of wire binds together now the tarsi of a Sparrow, now the
heels of a Mouse and is bent, at a distance of three-quarters of an
inch or so, into a little ring, which slips very loosely over one of
the prongs of the fork, a short, almost horizontal prong.To make the
hanging body fall, the slightest thrust upon this ring is sufficient;
and, owing to its projection from the peg, it lends itself excellently
to the insect's methods.In short, the arrangement is the same as it
was just now, with this difference, that the point of support is at a
short distance from the suspended animal.My trick, simple though it be, is fully successful.For a long time the
body is repeatedly shaken, but in vain; the tibiae or tarsi, unduly
hard, refuse to yield to the patient saw.Sparrows and Mice grow dry
and shrivelled, unused, upon the gibbet.Sooner in one case, later in
another, my Necrophori abandon the insoluble problem in mechanics: to
push, ever so little, the movable support and so to unhook the coveted
carcass.If they had had, but now, a lucid idea of
the mutual relations between the shackled limbs and the suspending peg;
if they had made the Mouse fall by a reasoned manoeuvre, whence comes
it that the present artifice, no less simple than the first, is to them
an insurmountable obstacle?For days and days they work on the body,
examine it from head to foot, without becoming aware of the movable
support, the cause of their misadventure.In vain do I prolong my
watch; never do I see a single one of them push it with his foot or
butt it with his head.Their defeat is not due to lack of strength.Like the Geotrupes, they
are vigorous excavators.Grasped in the closed hand, they insinuate
themselves through the interstices of the fingers and plough up your
skin in a fashion to make you very quickly loose your hold.With his
head, a robust ploughshare, the Beetle might very easily push the ring
off its short support.He is not able to do so because he does not
think of it; he does not think of it because he is devoid of the
faculty attributed to him, in order to support its thesis, by the
dangerous prodigality of transformism.Divine reason, sun of the intellect, what a clumsy slap in thy august
countenance, when the glorifiers of the animal degrade thee with such
dullness!Let us now examine under another aspect the mental obscurity of the
Necrophori.My captives are not so satisfied with their sumptuous
lodging that they do not seek to escape, especially when there is a
dearth of labour, that sovran consoler of the afflicted, man or beast.Internment within the wire cover palls upon them.So, the Mole buried
and all in order in the cellar, they stray uneasily over the wire-gauze
of the dome; they clamber up, descend, ascend again and take to flight,
a flight which instantly becomes a fall, owing to collision with the
wire grating.The sky is
superb; the weather is hot, calm and propitious for those in search of
the Lizard crushed beside the footpath.Perhaps the effluvia of the
gamy tit-bit have reached them, coming from afar, imperceptible to any
other sense than that of the Sexton-beetles.So my Necrophori are fain
to go their ways.Nothing would be easier if a glimmer of reason were to aid
them.Through the wire network, over which they have so often strayed,
they have seen, outside, the free soil, the promised land which they
long to reach.A hundred times if once have they dug at the foot of the
rampart.There, in vertical wells, they take up their station, drowsing
whole days on end while unemployed.If I give them a fresh Mole, they
emerge from their retreat by the entrance corridor and come to hide
themselves beneath the belly of the beast.The burial over, they
return, one here, one there, to the confines of the enclosure and
disappear beneath the soil.Well, in two and a half months of captivity, despite long stays at the
base of the trellis, at a depth of three-quarters of an inch beneath
the surface, it is rare indeed for a Necrophorus to succeed in
circumventing the obstacle, to prolong his excavation beneath the
barrier, to make an elbow in it and to bring it out on the other side,
a trifling task for these vigorous creatures.Of fourteen only one
succeeded in escaping.A chance deliverance and not premeditated; for, if the happy event had
been the result of a mental combination, the other prisoners,
practically his equals in powers of perception, would all, from first
to last, discover by rational means the elbowed path leading to the
outer world; and the cage would promptly be deserted.The failure of
the great majority proves that the single fugitive was simply digging
at random.Circumstances favoured him; and that is all.Do not let us
make it a merit that he succeeded where all the others failed.Let us also beware of attributing to the Necrophori an understanding
more limited than is usual in entomological psychology.I find the
ineptness of the undertaker in all the insects reared under the wire
cover, on the bed of sand into which the rim of the dome sinks a little
way.With very rare exceptions, fortuitous accidents, no insect has
thought of circumventing the barrier by way of the base; none has
succeeded in gaining the exterior by means of a slanting tunnel, not
even though it were a miner by profession, as are the Dung-beetles par
excellence.Captives under the wire dome, but desirous of escape,
Sacred Beetles, Geotrupes, Copres, Gymnopleuri, Sisyphi, all see about
them the freedom of space, the joys of the open sunlight; and not one
thinks of going round under the rampart, a front which would present no
difficulty to their pick-axes.Even in the higher ranks of animality, examples of similar mental
obfuscation are not lacking.Audubon relates how, in his days, the wild
Turkeys were caught in North America.In a clearing known to be frequented by these birds, a great cage was
constructed with stakes driven into the ground.In the centre of the
enclosure opened a short tunnel, which dipped under the palisade and
returned to the surface outside the cage by a gentle <DW72>, which was
open to the sky.The central opening, large enough to give a bird free
passage, occupied only a portion of the enclosure, leaving around it,
against the circle of stakes, a wide unbroken zone.A few handfuls of
maize were scattered in the interior of the trap, as well as round
about it, and in particular along the sloping path, which passed under
a sort of bridge and led to the centre of the contrivance.In short,
the Turkey-trap presented an ever-open door.The bird found it in order
to enter, but did not think of looking for it in order to return by it.According to the famous American ornithologist, the Turkeys, lured by
the grains of maize, descended the insidious <DW72>, entered the short
underground passage and beheld, at the end of it, plunder and the
light.A few steps farther and the gluttons emerged, one by one, from
beneath the bridge.The maize was abundant; and the Turkeys' crops grew swollen.When all was gathered, the band wished to retreat, but not one of the
prisoners paid any attention to the central hole by which he had
arrived.Gobbling uneasily, they passed again and again across the
bridge whose arch was yawning beside them; they circled round against
the palisade, treading a hundred times in their own footprints; they
thrust their necks, with their crimson wattles, through the bars; and
there, with beaks in the open air, they remained until they were
exhausted.Remember, inept fowl, the occurrences of a little while ago; think of
the tunnel which led you hither!If there be in that poor brain of
yours an atom of capacity, put two ideas together and remind yourself
that the passage by which you entered is there and open for your
escape!The light, an irresistible
attraction, holds you subjugated against the palisade; and the shadow
of the yawning pit, which has but lately permitted you to enter and
will quite as readily permit of your exit, leaves you indifferent.To
recognize the use of this opening you would have to reflect a little,
to evolve the past; but this tiny retrospective calculation is beyond
your powers.So the trapper, returning a few days later, will find a
rich booty, the entire flock imprisoned!Of poor intellectual repute, does the Turkey deserve his name for
stupidity?He does not appear to be more limited than another.Audubon
depicts him as endowed with certain useful ruses, in particular when he
has to baffle the attacks of his nocturnal enemy, the Virginian Owl.As
for his actions in the snare with the underground passage, any other
bird, impassioned of the light, would do the same.Under rather more difficult conditions, the Necrophorus repeats the
ineptness of the Turkey.When he wishes to return to the open daylight,
after resting in a short burrow against the rim of the wire cover, the
Beetle, seeing a little light filtering down through the loose soil,
reascends by the path of entry, incapable of telling himself that it
would suffice to prolong the tunnel as far in the opposite direction
for him to reach the outer world beyond the wall and gain his freedom.Here again is one in whom we shall seek in vain for any indication of
reflection.Like the rest, in spite of his legendary renown, he has no
guide but the unconscious promptings of instinct.To purge the earth of death's impurities and cause deceased animal
matter to be once more numbered among the treasures of life there are
hosts of sausage-queens, including, in our part of the world, the
Bluebottle (Calliphora vomitaria, Lin.)and the Grey Flesh-fly
(Sarcophaga carnaria, Lin.)Every one knows the first, the big,
dark-blue Fly who, after effecting her designs in the ill-watched
meat-safe, settles on our window-panes and keeps up a solemn buzzing,
anxious to be off in the sun and ripen a fresh emission of germs.How
does she lay her eggs, the origin of the loathsome maggot that battens
poisonously on our provisions whether of game or butcher's meat?What
are her stratagems and how can we foil them?This is what I propose to
investigate.The Bluebottle frequents our homes during autumn and a part of winter,
until the cold becomes severe; but her appearance in the fields dates
back much earlier.On the first fine day in February, we shall see her
warming herself, chillily, against the sunny walls.In April, I notice
her in considerable numbers on the laurustinus.It is here that she
seems to pair, while sipping the sugary exudations of the small white
flowers.The whole of the summer season is spent out of doors, in brief
flights from one refreshment-bar to the next.When autumn comes, with
its game, she makes her way into our houses and remains until the hard
frosts.This suits my stay-at-home habits and especially my legs, which are
bending under the weight of years.I need not run after the subjects of
my present study; they call on me.One and all bring me, in a little
screw of paper, the noisy visitor just captured against the panes.Thus do I fill my vivarium, which consists of a large, bell-shaped cage
of wire-gauze, standing in an earthenware pan full of sand.A mug
containing honey is the dining-room of the establishment.Here the
captives come to recruit themselves in their hours of leisure.To
occupy their maternal cares, I employ small birds--Chaffinches,
Linnets, Sparrows--brought down, in the enclosure, by my son's gun.I have just served up a Linnet shot two days ago.I next place in the
cage a Bluebottle, one only, to avoid confusion.Her fat belly
proclaims the advent of laying-time.An hour later, when the excitement
of being put in prison is allayed, my captive is in labour.With eager,
jerky steps, she explores the morsel of game, goes from the head to the
tail, returns from the tail to the head, repeats the action several
times and at last settles near an eye, a dimmed eye sunk into its
socket.The ovipositor bends at a right angle and dives into the junction of
the beak, straight down to the root.Then the eggs are emitted for
nearly half an hour.The layer, utterly absorbed in her serious
business, remains stationary and impassive and is easily observed
through my lens.A movement on my part would doubtless scare her; but
my restful presence gives her no anxiety.The discharge does not go on continuously until the ovaries are
exhausted; it is intermittent and performed in so many packets.Several
times over, the Fly leaves the bird's beak and comes to take a rest
upon the wire-gauze, where she brushes her hind-legs one against the
other.In particular, before using it again, she cleans, smooths and
polishes her laying-tool, the probe that places the eggs.Then, feeling
her womb still teeming, she returns to the same spot at the joint of
the beak.The delivery is resumed, to cease presently and then begin
anew.A couple of hours are thus spent in alternate standing near the
eye and resting on the wire-gauze.The Fly does not go back to the bird, a proof that
her ovaries are exhausted.The eggs are
dabbed in a continuous layer, at the entrance to the throat, at the
root of the tongue, on the membrane of the palate.Their number appears
considerable; the whole inside of the gullet is white with them.I fix
a little wooden prop between the two mandibles of the beak, to keep
them open and enable me to see what happens.I learn in this way that the hatching takes place in a couple of days.As soon as they are born, the young vermin, a swarming mass, leave the
place where they are and disappear down the throat.The beak of the bird invaded was closed at the start, as far as the
natural contact of the mandibles allowed.There remained a narrow slit
at the base, sufficient at most to admit the passage of a horse-hair.It was through this that the laying was performed.Lengthening her
ovipositor like a telescope, the mother inserted the point of her
implement, a point slightly hardened with a horny armour.The fineness
of the probe equals the fineness of the aperture.But, if the beak were
entirely closed, where would the eggs be laid then?With a tied thread I keep the two mandibles in absolute contact; and I
place a second Bluebottle in the presence of the Linnet, whom the
colonists have already entered by the beak.This time the laying takes
place on one of the eyes, between the lid and the eyeball.At the
hatching, which again occurs a couple of days later, the grubs make
their way into the fleshy depths of the socket.The eyes and the beak,
therefore, form the two chief entrances into feathered game.There are others; and these are the wounds.I cover the Linnet's head
with a paper hood which will prevent invasion through the beak and
eyes.I serve it, under the wire-gauze bell, to a third egg-layer.The
bird has been struck by a shot in the breast, but the sore is not
bleeding: no outer stain marks the injured spot.Moreover, I am careful
to arrange the feathers, to smooth them with a hair-pencil, so that the
bird looks quite smart and has every appearance of being untouched.She inspects the Linnet from end to end; with
her front tarsi she fumbles at the breast and belly.It is a sort of
auscultation by sense of touch.The insect becomes aware of what is
under the feathers by the manner in which these react.If scent lends
its assistance, it can only be very slightly, for the game is not yet
high.No drop of blood is near it, for it is
closed by a plug of down rammed into it by the shot.The Fly takes up
her position without separating the feathers or uncovering the wound.She remains here for two hours without stirring, motionless, with her
abdomen concealed beneath the plumage.My eager curiosity does not
distract her from her business for a moment.When she has finished, I take her place.There is nothing either on the
skin or at the mouth of the wound.I have to withdraw the downy plug
and dig to some depth before discovering the eggs.The ovipositor has
therefore lengthened its extensible tube and pushed beyond the feather
stopper driven in by the lead.The eggs are in one packet; they number
about three hundred.When the beak and eyes are rendered inaccessible, when the body,
moreover, has no wounds, the laying still takes place, but this time in
a hesitating and niggardly fashion.I pluck the bird completely, the
better to watch what happens; also, I cover the head with a paper hood
to close the usual means of access.For a long time, with jerky steps,
the mother explores the body in every direction; she takes her stand by
preference on the head, which she sounds by tapping on it with her
front tarsi.She knows that the openings which she needs are there,
under the paper; but she also knows how frail are her grubs, how
powerless to pierce their way through the strange obstacle which stops
her as well and interferes with the work of her ovipositor.The cowl
inspires her with profound distrust.Despite the tempting bait of the
veiled head, not an egg is laid on the wrapper, slight though it may
be.Weary of vain attempts to compass this obstacle, the Fly at last
decides in favour of other points, but not on the breast, belly, or
back, where the hide would seem too tough and the light too intrusive.She needs dark hiding-places, corners where the skin is very delicate.The spots chosen are the cavity of the axilla, corresponding with our
arm-pit, and the crease where the thigh joins the belly.Eggs are laid
in both places, but not many, showing that the groin and the axilla are
adopted only reluctantly and for lack of a better spot.With an unplucked bird, also hooded, the same experiment failed: the
feathers prevent the Fly from slipping into those deep places.Let us
add, in conclusion, that, on a skinned bird, or simply on a piece of
butcher's meat, the laying is effected on any part whatever, provided
that it be dark.It follows from all this that, to lay her eggs, the Bluebottle picks
out either naked wounds or else the mucous membranes of the mouth or
eyes, which are not protected by a skin of any thickness.The perfect efficiency of the paper bag, which prevents the inroads of
the worms through the eye-sockets or the beak, suggests a similar
experiment with the whole bird.It is a matter of wrapping the body in
a sort of artificial skin which will be as discouraging to the Fly as
the natural skin.Linnets, some with deep wounds, others almost intact,
are placed one by one in paper envelopes similar to those in which the
nursery-gardener keeps his seeds, envelopes just folded, without being
stuck.The paper is quite ordinary and of middling thickness.Torn
pieces of newspaper serve the purpose.These sheaths with the corpses inside them are freely exposed to the
air, on the table in my study, where they are visited, according to the
time of day, in dense shade and in bright sunlight.Attracted by the
effluvia from the dead meat, the Bluebottles haunt my laboratory, the
windows of which are always open.I see them daily alighting on the
envelopes and very busily exploring them, apprised of the contents by
the gamy smell.Their incessant coming and going is a sign of intense
cupidity; and yet none of them decides to lay on the bags.They do not
even attempt to slide their ovipositor through the slits of the folds.The favourable season passes and not an egg is laid on the tempting
wrappers.All the mothers abstain, judging the slender obstacle of the
paper to be more than the vermin will be able to overcome.This caution on the Fly's part does not at all surprise me: motherhood
everywhere has great gleams of perspicacity.What does astonish me is
the following result.The parcels containing the Linnets are left for a
whole year uncovered on the table; they remain there for a second year
and a third.The little birds
are intact, with unrumpled feathers, free from smell, dry and light,
like mummies.They have become not decomposed, but mummified.I expected to see them putrefying, running into sanies, like corpses
left to rot in the open air.On the contrary, the birds have dried and
hardened, without undergoing any change.What did they want for their
putrefaction?The maggot,
therefore, is the primary cause of dissolution after death; it is,
above all, the putrefactive chemist.A conclusion not devoid of value may be drawn from my paper game-bags.In our markets, especially in those of the South, the game is hung
unprotected from the hooks on the stalls.Larks strung up by the dozen
with a wire through their nostrils, Thrushes, Plovers, Teal,
Partridges, Snipe, in short, all the glories of the spit which the
autumn migration brings us, remain for days and weeks at the mercy of
the Flies.The buyer allows himself to be tempted by a goodly exterior;
he makes his purchase and, back at home, just when the bird is being
prepared for roasting, he discovers that the promised dainty is alive
with worms.There is nothing for it but to throw the
loathsome, verminous thing away.Everybody knows it, and nobody
thinks seriously of shaking off her tyranny: not the retailer, nor the
wholesale dealer, nor the killer of the game.What is wanted to keep
the maggots out?Hardly anything: to slip each bird into a paper
sheath.If this precaution were taken at the start, before the Flies
arrive, any game would be safe and could be left indefinitely to attain
the degree of ripeness required by the epicure's palate.Stuffed with olives and myrtleberries, the Corsican Blackbirds are
exquisite eating.We sometimes receive them at Orange, layers of them,
packed in baskets through which the air circulates freely and each
contained in a paper wrapper.They are in a state of perfect
preservation, complying with the most exacting demands of the kitchen.I congratulate the nameless shipper who conceived the bright idea of
clothing his Blackbirds in paper.There is, of course, a serious objection to this method of
preservation.In its paper shroud, the article is invisible; it is not
enticing; it does not inform the passer-by of its nature and qualities.There is one resource left which would leave the bird uncovered: simply
to case the head in a paper cap.The head being the part most menaced,
because of the mucous membrane of the throat and eyes, it would be
enough, as a rule, to protect the head, in order to keep off the Flies
and thwart their attempts.Let us continue to study the Bluebottle, while varying our means of
information.A tin, about four inches deep, contains a piece of
butcher's meat.The lid is not put in quite straight and leaves a
narrow slit at one point of its circumference, allowing, at most, of
the passage of a fine needle.When the bait begins to give off a gamy
scent, the mothers come, singly or in numbers.They are attracted by
the odour which, transmitted through a thin crevice, hardly reaches my
nostrils.They explore the metal receptacle for some time, seeking an entrance.Finding naught that enables them to reach the coveted morsel, they
decide to lay their eggs on the tin, just beside the aperture.Sometimes, when the width of the passage allows of it, they insert the
ovipositor into the tin and lay the eggs inside, on the very edge of
the slit.Whether outside or in, the eggs are dabbed down in a fairly
regular and absolutely white layer.We have seen the Bluebottle refusing to lay her eggs on the paper bag,
notwithstanding the carrion fumes of the Linnet enclosed; yet now,
without hesitation, she lays them on a sheet of metal.Can the nature
of the floor make any difference to her?I replace the tin lid by a
paper cover stretched and pasted over the orifice.With the point of my
knife I make a narrow slit in this new lid.That is quite enough: the
parent accepts the paper.What determined her, therefore, is not simply the smell, which can
easily be perceived even through the uncut paper, but, above all, the
crevice, which will provide an entrance for the vermin, hatched
outside, near the narrow passage.The maggots' mother has her own
logic, her prudent foresight.She knows how feeble her wee grubs will
be, how powerless to cut their way through an obstacle of any
resistance; and so, despite the temptation of the smell, she refrains
from laying, so long as she finds no entrance through which the
new-born worms can slip unaided.I wanted to know whether the colour, the shininess, the degree of
hardness and other qualities of the obstacle would influence the
decision of a mother obliged to lay her eggs under exceptional
conditions.With this object in view, I employed small jars, each
baited with a bit of butcher's meat.The respective lids were made of
different- paper, of oil-skin, or of some of that tin-foil,
with its gold or coppery sheen, which is used for sealing
liqueur-bottles.On not one of these covers did the mothers stop, with
any desire to deposit their eggs; but, from the moment that the knife
had made the narrow slit, all the lids were, sooner or later, visited
and all, sooner or later, received the white shower somewhere near the
gash.The look of the obstacle, therefore, does not count; dull or
brilliant, drab or : these are details of no importance; the
thing that matters is that there should be a passage to allow the grubs
to enter.Though hatched outside, at a distance from the coveted morsel, the
new-born worms are well able to find their refectory.As they release
themselves from the egg, without hesitation, so accurate is their
scent, they slip beneath the edge of the ill-joined lid, or through the
passage cut by the knife.Behold them entering upon their promised
land, their reeking paradise.Eager to arrive, do they drop from the top of the wall?Slowly creeping, they make their way down the side of the jar; they use
their fore-part, ever in quest of information, as a crutch and grapnel
in one.They reach the meat and at once instal themselves upon it.Let us continue our investigation, varying the conditions.A large
test-tube, measuring nine inches high, is baited at the bottom with a
lump of butcher's meat.It is closed with wire-gauze, whose meshes, two
millimetres wide (.078 inch.--Translator's Note.), do not permit of the
Fly's passage.The Bluebottle comes to my apparatus, guided by scent
rather than sight.She hastens to the test-tube, whose contents are
veiled under an opaque cover, with the same alacrity as to the open
tube.The invisible attracts her quite as much as the visible.She stays awhile on the lattice of the mouth, inspects it attentively;
but, whether because circumstances failed to serve me, or because the
wire network inspired her with distrust, I never saw her dab her eggs
upon it for certain.As her evidence was doubtful, I had recourse to
the Flesh-fly (Sarcophaga carnaria).This Fly is less finicking in her preparations, she has more faith in
the strength of her worms, which are born ready-formed and vigorous,
and easily shows me what I wish to see.She explores the trellis-work,
chooses a mesh through which she inserts the tip of her abdomen, and,
undisturbed by my presence, emits, one after the other, a certain
number of grubs, about ten or so.True, her visits will be repeated,
increasing the family at a rate of which I am ignorant.The new-born worms, thanks to a slight viscidity, cling for a moment to
the wire-gauze; they swarm, wriggle, release themselves and leap into
the chasm.It is a nine-inch drop at least.When this is done, the
mother makes off, knowing for a certainty that her offspring will shift
for themselves.If they fall on the meat, well and good; if they fall
elsewhere, they can reach the morsel by crawling.This confidence in the unknown factor of the precipice, with no
indication but that of smell, deserves fuller investigation.From what
height will the Flesh-fly dare to let her children drop?I top the
test-tube with another tube, the width of the neck of a claret-bottle.The mouth is closed either with wire-gauze or with a paper cover with a
slight cut in it.Altogether, the apparatus measures twenty-five inches
in height.No matter: the fall is not serious for the lithe backs of
the young grubs; and, in a few days, the test-tube is filled with
larvae, in which it is easy to recognize the Flesh-fly's family by the
fringed coronet that opens and shuts at the maggot's stern like the
petals of a little flower.I did not see the mother operating: I was
not there at the time; but there is no doubt possible of her coming,
nor of the great dive taken by the family: the contents of the
test-tube furnish me with a duly authenticated certificate.I admire the leap and, to obtain one better still, I replace the tube
by another, so that the apparatus now stands forty-six inches high.The
column is erected at a spot frequented by Flies, in a dim light.Its
mouth, closed with a wire-gauze cover, reaches the level of various
other appliances, test-tubes and jars, which are already stocked or
awaiting their colony of vermin.When the position is well-known to the
Flies, I remove the other tubes and leave the column, lest the visitors
should turn aside to easier ground.From time to time the Bluebottle and the Flesh-fly perch on the
trellis-work, make a short investigation and then decamp.Throughout
the summer season, for three whole months, the apparatus remains where
it is, without result: never a worm.Does the
stench of the meat not spread, coming from that depth?Certainly it
spreads: it is unmistakable to my dulled nostrils and still more so to
the nostrils of my children, whom I call to bear witness.Then why does
the Flesh-fly, who but now was dropping her grubs from a goodly height,
refuse to let them fall from the top of a column twice as high?Does
she fear lest her worms should be bruised by an excessive drop?There
is nothing about her to point to anxiety aroused by the length of the
shaft.I never see her explore the tube or take its size.She stands on
the trellised orifice; and there the matter ends.Can she be apprised
of the depth of the chasm by the comparative faintness of the offensive
odours that arise from it?Can the sense of smell measure the distance
and judge whether it be acceptable or not?The fact remains that, despite the attraction of the scent, the
Flesh-fly does not expose her worms to disproportionate falls.Can she
know beforehand that, when the chrysalids break, her winged family,
knocking with a sudden flight against the sides of a tall chimney, will
be unable to get out?This foresight would be in agreement with the
rules which order maternal instinct according to future needs.But, when the fall does not exceed a certain depth, the budding worms
of the Flesh-fly are dropped without a qualm, as all our experiments
show.This principle has a practical application which is not without
its value in matters of domestic economy.It is as well that the
wonders of entomology should sometimes give us a hint of commonplace
utility.The usual meat-safe is a sort of large cage with a top and bottom of
wood and four wire-gauze sides.Hooks fixed into the top are used
whereby to hang pieces which we wish to protect from the Flies.Often,
so as to employ the space to the best advantage, these pieces are
simply laid on the floor of the cage.With these arrangements, are we
sure of warding off the Fly and her vermin?We may protect ourselves against the Bluebottle, who is not
much inclined to lay her eggs at a distance from the meat; but there is
still the Flesh-fly, who is more venturesome and goes more briskly to
work and who will slip the grubs through a hole in the meshes and drop
them inside the safe.Agile as they are and well able to crawl, the
worms will easily reach anything on the floor; the only things secure
from their attacks will be the pieces hanging from the ceiling.It is
not in the nature of maggots to explore the heights, especially if this
implies climbing down a string in addition.People also use wire-gauze dish-covers.The trellised dome protects the
contents even less than does the meat-safe.The Flesh-fly takes no heed
of it.She can drop her worms through the meshes on the covered joint.We need only wrap the
birds which we wish to preserve--Thrushes, Partridges, Snipe and so
on--in separate paper envelopes; and the same with our beef and mutton.This defensive armour alone, while leaving ample room for the air to
circulate, makes any invasion by the worms impossible; even without a
cover or a meat-safe: not that paper possesses any special preservative
virtues, but solely because it forms an impenetrable barrier.The
Bluebottle carefully refrains from laying her eggs upon it and the
Flesh-fly from bringing forth her offspring, both of them knowing that
their new-born young are incapable of piercing the obstacle.Paper is equally successful in our strife against the Moths, those
plagues of our furs and clothes.To keep away these wholesale ravagers,
people generally use camphor, naphthalene, tobacco, bunches of
lavender, and other strong-scented remedies.Without wishing to malign
those preservatives, we are bound to admit that the means employed are
none too effective.The smell does very little to prevent the havoc of
the Moths.I would therefore advise our housewives, instead of all this chemist's
stuff, to use newspapers of a suitable shape and size.Take whatever
you wish to protect--your furs, your flannel, or your clothes--and pack
each article carefully in a newspaper, joining the edges with a double
fold, well pinned.If this joining is properly done, the Moth will
never get inside.Since my advice has been taken and this method
employed in my household, the old damage has no longer been repeated.A piece of meat is hidden in a jar under a layer
of fine, dry sand, a finger's-breadth thick.The jar has a wide mouth
and is left quite open.Let whoso come that will, attracted by the
smell.The Bluebottles are not long in inspecting what I have prepared
for them: they enter the jar, go out and come back again, inquiring
into the invisible thing revealed by its fragrance.A diligent watch
enables me to see them fussing about, exploring the sandy expanse,
tapping it with their feet, sounding it with their proboscis.I leave
the visitors undisturbed for a fortnight or three weeks.This is a repetition of what the paper bag, with its dead bird, showed
me.The Flies refuse to lay on the sand, apparently for the same
reasons.The paper was considered an obstacle which the frail vermin
would not be able to overcome.Its
grittiness would hurt the new-born weaklings, its dryness would absorb
the moisture indispensable to their movements.Later, when preparing
for the metamorphosis, when their strength has come to them, the grubs
will dig the earth quite well and be able to descend: but, at the
start, that would be very dangerous for them.Knowing these
difficulties, the mothers, however greatly tempted by the smell,
abstain from breeding.As a matter of fact, after long waiting, fearing
lest some packets of eggs may have escaped my attention, I inspect the
contents of the jar from top to bottom.Meat and sand contain neither
larvae nor pupae: the whole is absolutely deserted.The layer of sand being only a finger's-breadth thick, this experiment
requires certain precautions.The meat may expand a little, in going
bad, and protrude in one or two places.However small the fleshy eyots
that show above the surface, the Flies come to them and breed.Sometimes also the juices oozing from the putrid meat soak a small
extent of the sandy floor.That is enough for the maggot's first
establishment.These causes of failure are avoided with a layer of sand
about an inch thick.Then the Bluebottle, the Flesh-fly, and other
Flies whose grubs batten on dead bodies are kept at a proper distance.In the hope of awakening us to a proper sense of our insignificance,
pulpit orators sometimes make an unfair use of the grave and its worms.Let us put no faith in their doleful rhetoric.The chemistry of man's
final dissolution is eloquent enough of our emptiness: there is no need
to add imaginary horrors.The worm of the sepulchre is an invention of
cantankerous minds, incapable of seeing things as they are.Covered by
but a few inches of earth, the dead can sleep their quiet sleep: no Fly
will ever come to take advantage of them.At the surface of the soil, exposed to the air, the hideous invasion is
possible; aye, it is the invariable rule.For the melting down and
remoulding of matter, man is no better, corpse for corpse, than the
lowest of the brutes.Then the Fly exercises her rights and deals with
us as she does with any ordinary animal refuse.Nature treats us with
magnificent indifference in her great regenerating factory: placed in
her crucibles, animals and men, beggars and kings are 1 and all alike.There you have true equality, the only equality in this world of ours:
equality in the presence of the maggot.Drover Dingdong's Sheep followed the Ram which Panurge had maliciously
thrown overboard and leapt nimbly into the sea, one after the other,
"for you know," says Rabelais, "it is the nature of the sheep always to
follow the first, wheresoever it goes."The Pine caterpillar is even more sheeplike, not from foolishness, but
from necessity: where the first goes all the others go, in a regular
string, with not an empty space between them.They proceed in single file, in a continuous row, each touching with
its head the rear of the one in front of it.The complex twists and
turns described in his vagaries by the caterpillar leading the van are
scrupulously described by all the others.No Greek theoria winding its
way to the Eleusinian festivals was ever more orderly.Hence the name
of Processionary given to the gnawer of the pine.His character is complete when we add that he is a rope-dancer all his
life long: he walks only on the tight-rope, a silken rail placed in
position as he advances.The caterpillar who chances to be at the head
of the procession dribbles his thread without ceasing and fixes it on
the path which his fickle preferences cause him to take.The thread is
so tiny that the eye, though armed with a magnifying-glass, suspects it
rather than sees it.But a second caterpillar steps on the slender foot-board and doubles it
with his thread; a third trebles it; and all the others, however many
there be, add the sticky spray from their spinnerets, so much so that,
when the procession has marched by, there remains, as a record of its
passing, a narrow white ribbon whose dazzling whiteness shimmers in the
sun.Very much more sumptuous than ours, their system of road-making
consists in upholstering with silk instead of macadamizing.We sprinkle
our roads with broken stones and level them by the pressure of a heavy
steam-roller; they lay over their paths a soft satin rail, a work of
general interest to which each contributes his thread.Could they not, like other
caterpillars, walk about without these costly preparations?I see two
reasons for their mode of progression.It is night when the
Processionaries sally forth to browse upon the pine-leaves.They leave
their nest, situated at the top of a bough, in profound darkness; they
go down the denuded pole till they come to the nearest branch that has
not yet been gnawed, a branch which becomes lower and lower by degrees
as the consumers finish stripping the upper storeys; they climb up this
untouched branch and spread over the green needles.When they have had their suppers and begin to feel the keen night air,
the next thing is to return to the shelter of the house.Measured in a
straight line, the distance is not great, hardly an arm's length; but
it cannot be covered in this way on foot.The caterpillars have to
climb down from one crossing to the next, from the needle to the twig,
from the twig to the branch, from the branch to the bough and from the
bough, by a no less angular path, to go back home.It is useless to
rely upon sight as a guide on this long and erratic journey.The
Processionary, it is true, has five ocular specks on either side of his
head, but they are so infinitesimal, so difficult to make out through
the magnifying-glass, that we cannot attribute to them any great power
of vision.Besides, what good would those short-sighted lenses be in
the absence of light, in black darkness?It is equally useless to think of the sense of smell.Has the
Processional any olfactory powers or has he not?Without
giving a positive answer to the question, I can at least declare that
his sense of smell is exceedingly dull and in no way suited to help him
find his way.This is proved, in my experiments, by a number of hungry
caterpillars that, after a long fast, pass close beside a pine-branch
without betraying any eagerness of showing a sign of stopping.It is
the sense of touch that tells them where they are.So long as their
lips do not chance to light upon the pasture-land, not one of them
settles there, though he be ravenous.They do not hasten to food which
they have scented from afar; they stop at a branch which they encounter
on their way.Apart from sight and smell, what remains to guide them in returning to
the nest?In the Cretan labyrinth, Theseus
would have been lost but for the clue of thread with which Ariadne
supplied him.The spreading maze of the pine-needles is, especially at
night, as inextricable a labyrinth as that constructed for Minos.The
Processionary finds his way through it, without the possibility of a
mistake, by the aid of his bit of silk.At the time for going home,
each easily recovers either his own thread or one or other of the
neighbouring threads, spread fanwise by the diverging herd; one by one
the scattered tribe line up on the common ribbon, which started from
the nest; and the sated caravan finds its way back to the manor with
absolute certainty.Longer expeditions are made in the daytime, even in winter, if the
weather be fine.Our caterpillars then come down from the tree, venture
on the ground, march in procession for a distance of thirty yards or
so.The object of these sallies is not to look for food, for the native
pine-tree is far from being exhausted: the shorn branches hardly count
amid the vast leafage.Moreover, the caterpillars observe complete
abstinence till nightfall.The trippers have no other object than a
constitutional, a pilgrimage to the outskirts to see what these are
like, possibly an inspection of the locality where, later on, they mean
to bury themselves in the sand for their metamorphosis.It goes without saying that, in these greater evolutions, the guiding
cord is not neglected.All
contribute to it from the produce of their spinnerets, as is the
invariable rule whenever there is a progression.Not one takes a step
forward without fixing to the path the thread from his lips.If the series forming the procession be at all long, the ribbon is
dilated sufficiently to make it easy to find; nevertheless, on the
homeward journey, it is not picked up without some hesitation.For
observe that the caterpillars when on the march never turn completely;
to wheel round on their tight-rope is a method utterly unknown to them.In order therefore to regain the road already covered, they have to
describe a zigzag whose windings and extent are determined by the
leader's fancy.Hence come gropings and roamings which are sometimes
prolonged to the point of causing the herd to spend the night out of
doors.They collect into a motionless
cluster.To-morrow the search will start afresh and will sooner or
later be successful.Oftener still the winding curve meets the
guide-thread at the first attempt.As soon as the first caterpillar has
the rail between his legs, all hesitation ceases; and the band makes
for the nest with hurried steps.The use of this silk-tapestried roadway is evident from a second point
of view.To protect himself against the severity of the winter which he
has to face when working, the Pine Caterpillar weaves himself a shelter
in which he spends his bad hours, his days of enforced idleness.Alone,
with none but the meagre resources of his silk-glands, he would find
difficulty in protecting himself on the top of a branch buffeted by the
winds.A substantial dwelling, proof against snow, gales and icy fogs,
requires the cooperation of a large number.Out of the individual's
piled-up atoms, the community obtains a spacious and durable
establishment.Every evening, when the
weather permits, the building has to be strengthened and enlarged.It
is indispensable, therefore, that the corporation of workers should not
be dissolved while the stormy season continues and the insects are
still in the caterpillar stage.But, without special arrangements, each
nocturnal expedition at grazing-time would be a cause of separation.At
that moment of appetite for food there is a return to individualism.The caterpillars become more or less scattered, settling singly on the
branches around; each browses his pine-needle separately.How are they
to find one another afterwards and become a community again?The several threads left on the road make this easy.With that guide,
every caterpillar, however far he may be, comes back to his companions
without ever missing the way.They come hurrying from a host of twigs,
from here, from there, from above, from below; and soon the scattered
legion reforms into a group.The silk thread is something more than a
road-making expedient: it is the social bond, the system that keeps the
members of the brotherhood indissolubly united.At the head of every procession, long or short, goes a first
caterpillar whom I will call the leader of the march or file, though
the word leader, which I use for the want of a better, is a little out
of place here.Nothing, in fact, distinguishes this caterpillar from
the others: it just depends upon the order in which they happen to line
up; and mere chance brings him to the front.Among the Processionaries,
every captain is an officer of fortune.The actual leader leads;
presently he will be a subaltern, if the line should break up in
consequence of some accident and be formed anew in a different order.His temporary functions give him an attitude of his own.While the
others follow passively in a close file, he, the captain, tosses
himself about and with an abrupt movement flings the front of his body
hither and thither.As he marches ahead he seems to be seeking his way.Does he in point of fact explore the country?Does he choose the most
practicable places?Or are his hesitations merely the result of the
absence of a guiding thread on ground that has not yet been covered?His subordinates follow very placidly, reassured by the cord which they
hold between their legs; he, deprived of that support, is uneasy.Why cannot I read what passes under his black, shiny skull, so like a
drop of tar to look at?To judge by actions, there is here a modicum of
discernment which is able, after experimenting, to recognize excessive
roughnesses, over-slippery surfaces, dusty places that offer no
resistance and, above all, the threads left by other excursionists.This is all or nearly all that my long acquaintance with the
Processionaries has taught me as to their mentality.Poor brains,
indeed; poor creatures, whose commonwealth has its safety hanging upon
a thread!The finest that I have seen
manoeuvring on the ground measured twelve or thirteen yards and
numbered about three hundred caterpillars, drawn up with absolute
precision in a wavy line.But, if there were only two in a row the
order would still be perfect: the second touches and follows the first.By February I have processions of all lengths in the greenhouse.What
tricks can I play upon them?I see only two: to do away with the
leader; and to cut the thread.The suppression of the leader of the file produces nothing striking.If
the thing is done without creating a disturbance, the procession does
not alter its ways at all.The second caterpillar, promoted to captain,
knows the duties of his rank off-hand: he selects and leads, or rather
he hesitates and gropes.The breaking of the silk ribbon is not very important either.I remove
a caterpillar from the middle of the file.With my scissors, so as not
to cause a commotion in the ranks, I cut the piece of ribbon on which
he stood and clear away every thread of it.As a result of this breach,
the procession acquires two marching leaders, each independent of the
other.It may be that the one in the rear joins the file ahead of him,
from which he is separated by but a slender interval; in that case,
things return to their original condition.More frequently, the two
parts do not become reunited.In that case, we have two distinct
processions, each of which wanders where it pleases and diverges from
the other.Nevertheless, both will be able to return to the nest by
discovering sooner or later, in the course of their peregrinations, the
ribbon on the other side of the break.I have thought
out another, one more fertile in possibilities.I propose to make the
caterpillars describe a close circuit, after the ribbons running from
it and liable to bring about a change of direction have been destroyed.The locomotive engine pursues its invariable course so long as it is
not shunted on to a branch-line.If the Processionaries find the silken
rail always clear in front of them, with no switches anywhere, will
they continue on the same track, will they persist in following a road
that never comes to an end?What we have to do is to produce this
circuit, which is unknown under ordinary conditions, by artificial
means.The first idea that suggests itself is to seize with the forceps the
silk ribbon at the back of the train, to bend it without shaking it and
to bring the end of it ahead of the file.If the caterpillar marching
in the van steps upon it, the thing is done: the others will follow him
faithfully.The operation is very simple in theory but most difficult
in practice and produces no useful results.The ribbon, which is
extremely slight, breaks under the weight of the grains of sand that
stick to it and are lifted with it.If it does not break, the
caterpillars at the back, however delicately we may go to work, feel a
disturbance which makes them curl up or even let go.There is a yet greater difficulty: the leader refuses the ribbon laid
before him; the cut end makes him distrustful.Failing to see the
regular, uninterrupted road, he slants off to the right or left, he
escapes at a tangent.If I try to interfere and to bring him back to
the path of my choosing, he persists in his refusal, shrivels up, does
not budge, and soon the whole procession is in confusion.We will not
insist: the method is a poor one, very wasteful of effort for at best a
problematical success.We ought to interfere as little as possible and obtain a natural closed
circuit.It lies in our power, without the least
meddling, to see a procession march along a perfect circular track.I
owe this result, which is eminently deserving of our attention, to pure
chance.On the shelf with the layer of sand in which the nests are planted
stand some big palm-vases measuring nearly a yard and a half in
circumference at the top.The caterpillars often scale the sides and
climb up to the moulding which forms a cornice around the opening.This
place suits them for their processions, perhaps because of the absolute
firmness of the surface, where there is no fear of landslides, as on
the loose, sandy soil below; and also, perhaps, because of the
horizontal position, which is favourable to repose after the fatigue of
the ascent.It provides me with a circular track all ready-made.I have
nothing to do but wait for an occasion propitious to my plans.This
occasion is not long in coming.On the 30th of January, 1896, a little before twelve o'clock in the
day, I discover a numerous troop making their way up and gradually
reaching the popular cornice.Slowly, in single file, the caterpillars
climb the great vase, mount the ledge and advance in regular
procession, while others are constantly arriving and continuing the
series.I wait for the string to close up, that is to say, for the
leader, who keeps following the circular moulding, to return to the
point from which he started.My object is achieved in a quarter of an
hour.The closed circuit is realized magnificently, in something very
nearly approaching a circle.The next thing is to get rid of the rest of the ascending column, which
would disturb the fine order of the procession by an excess of
newcomers; it is also important that we should do away with all the
silken paths, both new and old, that can put the cornice into
communication with the ground.With a thick hair-pencil I sweep away
the surplus climbers; with a big brush, one that leaves no smell behind
it--for this might afterwards prove confusing--I carefully rub down the
vase and get rid of every thread which the caterpillars have laid on
the march.When these preparations are finished, a curious sight awaits
us.In the interrupted circular procession there is no longer a leader.Each caterpillar is preceded by another on whose heels he follows
guided by the silk track, the work of the whole party; he again has a
companion close behind him, following him in the same orderly way.And
this is repeated without variation throughout the length of the chain.None commands, or rather none modifies the trail according to his
fancy; all obey, trusting in the guide who ought normally to lead the
march and who in reality has been abolished by my trickery.From the first circuit of the edge of the tub the rail of silk has been
laid in position and is soon turned into a narrow ribbon by the
procession, which never ceases dribbling its thread as it goes.The
rail is simply doubled and has no branches anywhere, for my brush has
destroyed them all.What will the caterpillars do on this deceptive,
closed path?Will they walk endlessly round and round until their
strength gives out entirely?The old schoolmen were fond of quoting Buridan's Ass, that famous
Donkey who, when placed between two bundles of hay, starved to death
because he was unable to decide in favour of either by breaking the
equilibrium between two equal but opposite attractions.The Ass, who is no more foolish than any one else,
would reply to the logical snare by feasting off both bundles.Will my
caterpillars show a little of his mother wit?Will they, after many
attempts, be able to break the equilibrium of their closed circuit,
which keeps them on a road without a turning?Will they make up their
minds to swerve to this side or that, which is the only method of
reaching their bundle of hay, the green branch yonder, quite near, not
two feet off?I thought that they would and I was wrong.I said to myself:

"The procession will go on turning for some time, for an hour, two
hours, perhaps; then the caterpillars will perceive their mistake.They
will abandon the deceptive road and make their descent somewhere or
other."That they should remain up there, hard pressed by hunger and the lack
of cover, when nothing prevented them from going away, seemed to me
inconceivable imbecility.Facts, however, forced me to accept the
incredible.The circular procession begins, as I have said, on the 30th of January,
about midday, in splendid weather.The caterpillars march at an even
pace, each touching the stern of the one in front of him.The unbroken
chain eliminates the leader with his changes of direction; and all
follow mechanically, as faithful to their circle as are the hands of a
watch.The headless file has no liberty left, no will; it has become
mere clockwork.My success goes
far beyond my wildest suspicions.I stand amazed at it, or rather I am
stupefied.Meanwhile, the multiplied circuits change the original rail into a
superb ribbon a twelfth of an inch broad.I can easily see it
glittering on the red ground of the pot.The day is drawing to a close
and no alteration has yet taken place in the position of the trail.The trajectory is not a plane curve, but one which, at a certain point,
deviates and goes down a little way to the lower surface of the
cornice, returning to the top some eight inches farther.I marked these
two points of deviation in pencil on the vase at the outset.Well, all
that afternoon and, more conclusive still, on the following days, right
to the end of this mad dance, I see the string of caterpillars dip
under the ledge at the first point and come to the top again at the
second.Once the first thread is laid, the road to be pursued is
permanently established.If the road does not vary, the speed does.I measure nine centimetres
(3 1/2 inches.--Translator's Note.)But there are more or less lengthy halts; the pace slackens at
times, especially when the temperature falls.At ten o'clock in the
evening the walk is little more than a lazy swaying of the body.I
foresee an early halt, in consequence of the cold, of fatigue and
doubtless also of hunger.The caterpillars have come crowding from all
the nests in the greenhouse to browse upon the pine-branches planted by
myself beside the silken purses.Those in the garden do the same, for
the temperature is mild.The others, lined up along the earthenware
cornice, would gladly take part in the feast; they are bound to have an
appetite after a ten hours' walk.The branch stands green and tempting
not a hand's-breadth away.To reach it they need but go down; and the
poor wretches, foolish slaves of their ribbon that they are, cannot
make up their minds to do so.I leave the famished ones at half-past
ten, persuaded that they will take counsel with their pillow and that
on the morrow things will have resumed their ordinary course.I was expecting too much of them when I accorded them that
faint gleam of intelligence which the tribulations of a distressful
stomach ought, one would think, to have aroused.They are lined up as on the day before, but motionless.When the air
grows a little warmer, they shake off their torpor, revive and start
walking again.The circular procession begins anew, like that which I
have already seen.There is nothing more and nothing less to be noted
in their machine-like obstinacy.A cold snap has supervened, was indeed
foretold in the evening by the garden caterpillars, who refused to come
out despite appearances which to my duller senses seemed to promise a
continuation of the fine weather.At daybreak the rosemary-walks are
all asparkle with rime and for the second time this year there is a
sharp frost.The large pond in the garden is frozen over.What can the
caterpillars in the conservatory be doing?All are ensconced in their nests, except the stubborn processionists on
the edge of the vase, who, deprived of shelter as they are, seem to
have spent a very bad night.I find them clustered in two heaps,
without any attempt at order.They have suffered less from the cold,
thus huddled together.'Tis an ill wind that blows nobody any good.The severity of the night
has caused the ring to break into two segments which will, perhaps,
afford a chance of safety.Each group, as it survives and resumes its
walk, will presently be headed by a leader who, not being obliged to
follow a caterpillar in front of him, will possess some liberty of
movement and perhaps be able to make the procession swerve to one side.Remember that, in the ordinary processions, the caterpillar walking
ahead acts as a scout.While the others, if nothing occurs to create
excitement, keep to their ranks, he attends to his duties as a leader
and is continually turning his head to this side and that,
investigating, seeking, groping, making his choice.And things happen
as he decides: the band follows him faithfully.Remember also that,
even on a road which has already been travelled and beribboned, the
guiding caterpillar continues to explore.There is reason to believe that the Processionaries who have lost their
way on the ledge will find a chance of safety here.On recovering from their torpor, the two groups line up by degrees into
two distinct files.There are therefore two leaders, free to go where
they please, independent of each other.Will they succeed in leaving
the enchanted circle?At the sight of their large black heads swaying
anxiously from side to side, I am inclined to think so for a moment.As the ranks fill out, the two sections of
the chain meet and the circle is reconstituted.The momentary leaders
once more become simple subordinates; and again the caterpillars march
round and round all day.For the second time in succession, the night, which is very calm and
magnificently starry, brings a hard frost.In the morning the
Processionaries on the tub, the only ones who have camped unsheltered,
are gathered into a heap which largely overflows both sides of the
fatal ribbon.I am present at the awakening of the numbed ones.The
first to take the road is, as luck will have it, outside the track.Hesitatingly he ventures into unknown ground.He reaches the top of the
rim and descends upon the other side on the earth in the vase.He is
followed by six others, no more.Perhaps the rest of the troop, who
have not fully recovered from their nocturnal torpor, are too lazy to
bestir themselves.The result of this brief delay is a return to the old track.The
caterpillars embark on the silken trail and the circular march is
resumed, this time in the form of a ring with a gap in it.There is no
attempt, however, to strike a new course on the part of the guide whom
this gap has placed at the head.A chance of stepping outside the magic
circle has presented itself at last; and he does not know how to avail
himself of it.As for the caterpillars who have made their way to the inside of the
vase, their lot is hardly improved.They climb to the top of the palm,
starving and seeking for food.Finding nothing to eat that suits them,
they retrace their steps by following the thread which they have left
on the way, climb the ledge of the pot, strike the procession again
and, without further anxiety, slip back into the ranks.Once more the
ring is complete, once more the circle turns and turns.There is a legend that tells of
poor souls dragged along in an endless round until the hellish charm is
broken by a drop of holy water.What drop will good fortune sprinkle on
my Processionaries to dissolve their circle and bring them back to the
nest?I see only two means of conjuring the spell and obtaining a
release from the circuit.A
strange linking of cause and effect: from sorrow and wretchedness good
is to come.And, first, shriveling as the result of cold, the caterpillars gather
together without any order, heap themselves some on the path, some,
more numerous these, outside it.Among the latter there may be, sooner
or later, some revolutionary who, scorning the beaten track, will trace
out a new road and lead the troop back home.We have just seen an
instance of it.Seven penetrated to the interior of the vase and
climbed the palm.True, it was an attempt with no result but still an
attempt.For complete success, all that need be done would have been to
take the opposite <DW72>.In the second place, the exhaustion due to fatigue and hunger.A lame
one stops, unable to go farther.In front of the defaulter the
procession still continues to wend its way for a short time.The ranks
close up and an empty space appears.On coming to himself and resuming
the march, the caterpillar who has caused the breach becomes a leader,
having nothing before him.The least desire for emancipation is all
that he wants to make him launch the band into a new path which perhaps
will be the saving path.In short, when the Processionaries' train is in difficulties, what it
needs, unlike ours, is to run off the rails.The side-tracking is left
to the caprice of a leader who alone is capable of turning to the right
or left; and this leader is absolutely non-existent so long as the ring
remains unbroken.Lastly, the breaking of the circle, the one stroke of
luck, is the result of a chaotic halt, caused principally by excess of
fatigue or cold.The liberating accident, especially that of fatigue, occurs fairly
often.In the course of the same day, the moving circumference is cut
up several times into two or three sections; but continuity soon
returns and no change takes place.The bold
innovator who is to save the situation has not yet had his inspiration.There is nothing new on the fourth day, after an icy night like the
previous one; nothing to tell except the following detail.Yesterday I
did not remove the trace left by the few caterpillars who made their
way to the inside of the vase.This trace, together with a junction
connecting it with the circular road, is discovered in the course of
the morning.Half the troop takes advantage of it to visit the earth in
the pot and climb the palm; the other half remains on the ledge and
continues to walk along the old rail.In the afternoon the band of
emigrants rejoins the others, the circuit is completed and things
return to their original condition.The night frost becomes more intense, without
however as yet reaching the greenhouse.It is followed by bright
sunshine in a calm and limpid sky.As soon as the sun's rays have
warmed the panes a little, the caterpillars, lying in heaps, wake up
and resume their evolutions on the ledge of the vase.This time the
fine order of the beginning is disturbed and a certain disorder becomes
manifest, apparently an omen of deliverance near at hand.The
scouting-path inside the vase, which was upholstered in silk yesterday
and the day before, is to-day followed to its origin on the rim by a
part of the band and is then deserted after a short loop.The other
caterpillars follow the usual ribbon.The result of this bifurcation is
two almost equal files, walking along the ledge in the same direction,
at a short distance from each other, sometimes meeting, separating
farther on, in every case with some lack of order.The crippled, who refuse to go on,
are many.Breaches increase; files are split up into sections each of
which has its leader, who pokes the front of his body this way and that
to explore the ground.Everything seems to point to the disintegration
which will bring safety.Before
the night the single file is reconstituted and the invincible gyration
resumed.Heat comes, just as suddenly as the cold did.To-day, the 4th of
February, is a beautiful, mild day.Numerous festoons of caterpillars, issuing from the nests, meander
along the sand on the shelf.Above them, at every moment, the ring on
the ledge of the vase breaks up and comes together again.For the first
time I see daring leaders who, drunk with heat, standing only on their
hinder prolegs at the extreme edge of the earthenware rim, fling
themselves forward into space, twisting about, sounding the depths.The
endeavour is frequently repeated, while the whole troop stops.The
caterpillars' heads give sudden jerks, their bodies wriggle.One of the pioneers decides to take the plunge.The others, still confiding in the perfidious
silken path, dare not copy him and continue to go along the old road.The short string detached from the general chain gropes about a great
deal, hesitates long on the side of the vase; it goes half-way down,
then climbs up again slantwise, rejoins and takes its place in the
procession.This time the attempt has failed, though at the foot of the
vase, not nine inches away, there lay a bunch of pine-needles which I
had placed there with the object of enticing the hungry ones.Near as they were to the goal, they went up
again.Threads were laid on the way and
will serve as a lure to further enterprise.The road of deliverance has
its first landmarks.And, two days later, on the eighth day of the
experiment, the caterpillars--now singly, anon in small groups, then
again in strings of some length--come down from the ledge by following
the staked-out path.At sunset the last of the laggards is back in the
nest.For seven times twenty-four hours the
caterpillars have remained on the ledge of the vase.To make an ample
allowance for stops due to the weariness of this one or that and above
all for the rest taken during the colder hours of the night, we will
deduct one-half of the time.The average pace is nine centimetres a minute.(3 1/2
inches.--Translator's Note.)The aggregate distance covered, therefore,
is 453 metres, a good deal more than a quarter of a mile, which is a
great walk for these little crawlers.The circumference of the vase,
the perimeter of the track, is exactly 1 metre 35.(4 feet 5
inches.--Translator's Note.)Therefore the circle covered, always in
the same direction and always without result, was described three
hundred and thirty-five times.These figures surprise me, though I am already familiar with the
abysmal stupidity of insects as a class whenever the least accident
occurs.I feel inclined to ask myself whether the Processionaries were
not kept up there so long by the difficulties and dangers of the
descent rather than by the lack of any gleam of intelligence in their
benighted minds.The facts, however, reply that the descent is as easy
as the ascent.The caterpillar has a very supple back, well adapted for twisting round
projections or slipping underneath.He can walk with the same ease
vertically or horizontally, with his back down or up.Besides, he never
moves forward until he has fixed his thread to the ground.With this
support to his feet, he has no falls to fear, no matter what his
position.I had a proof of this before my eyes during a whole week.As I have
already said, the track, instead of keeping on one level, bends twice,
dips at a certain point under the ledge of the vase and reappears at
the top a little farther on.At one part of the circuit, therefore, the
procession walks on the lower surface of the rim; and this inverted
position implies so little discomfort or danger that it is renewed at
each turn for all the caterpillars from first to last.It is out of the question then to suggest the dread of a false step on
the edge of the rim which is so nimbly turned at each point of
inflexion.The caterpillars in distress, starved, shelterless, chilled
with cold at night, cling obstinately to the silk ribbon covered
hundreds of times, because they lack the rudimentary glimmers of reason
which would advise them to abandon it.The ordeal of a
five hundred yards' march and three to four hundred turns teach them
nothing; and it takes casual circumstances to bring them back to the
nest.They would perish on their insidious ribbon if the disorder of
the nocturnal encampments and the halts due to fatigue did not cast a
few threads outside the circular path.Some three or four move along
these trails, laid without an object, stray a little way and, thanks to
their wanderings, prepare the descent, which is at last accomplished in
short strings favoured by chance.The school most highly honoured to-day is very anxious to find the
origin of reason in the dregs of the animal kingdom.Let me call its
attention to the Pine Processionary.THE NARBONNE LYCOSA, OR BLACK-BELLIED TARANTULA.Michelet has told us how, as a printer's apprentice in a cellar, he
established amicable relations with a Spider.(Jules Michelet
(1798-1874), author of "L'Oiseau" and "L'Insecte," in addition to the
historical works for which he is chiefly known.As a lad, he helped his
father, a printer by trade, in setting type.--Translator's Note.)At a
certain hour of the day, a ray of sunlight would glint through the
window of the gloomy workshop and light up the little compositor's
case.Then his eight-legged neighbour would come down from her web and
on the edge of the case take her share of the sunshine.The boy did not
interfere with her; he welcomed the trusting visitor as a friend and as
a pleasant diversion from the long monotony.When we lack the society
of our fellow-men, we take refuge in that of animals, without always
losing by the change.I do not, thank God, suffer from the melancholy of a cellar: my
solitude is gay with light and verdure; I attend, whenever I please,
the fields' high festival, the Thrushes' concert, the Crickets'
symphony; and yet my friendly commerce with the Spider is marked by an
even greater devotion than the young type-setter's.I admit her to the
intimacy of my study, I make room for her among my books, I set her in
the sun on my window-ledge, I visit her assiduously at her home, in the
country.The object of our relations is not to create a means of escape
from the petty worries of life, pin-pricks whereof I have my share like
other men, a very large share, indeed; I propose to submit to the
Spider a host of questions whereto, at times, she condescends to reply.To what fair problems does not the habit of frequenting her give rise!To set them forth worthily, the marvellous art which the little printer
was to acquire were not too much.One needs the pen of a Michelet; and
I have but a rough, blunt pencil.Let us try, nevertheless: even when
poorly clad, truth is still beautiful.The most robust Spider in my district is the Narbonne Lycosa, or
Black-bellied Tarantula, clad in black velvet on the lower surface,
especially under the belly, with brown chevrons on the abdomen and grey
and white rings around the legs.Her favourite home is the dry, pebbly
ground, covered with sun-scorched thyme.In my harmas laboratory there
are quite twenty of this Spider's burrows.Rarely do I pass by one of
these haunts without giving a glance down the pit where gleam, like
diamonds, the four great eyes, the four telescopes, of the hermit.The
four others, which are much smaller, are not visible at that depth.Would I have greater riches, I have but to walk a hundred yards from my
house, on the neighbouring plateau, once a shady forest, to-day a
dreary solitude where the Cricket browses and the Wheat-ear flits from
stone to stone.The love of lucre has laid waste the land.Because wine
paid handsomely, they pulled up the forest to plant the vine.Then came
the Phylloxera, the vine-stocks perished and the once green table-land
is now no more than a desolate stretch where a few tufts of hardy
grasses sprout among the pebbles.This waste-land is the Lycosa's
paradise: in an hour's time, if need were, I should discover a hundred
burrows within a limited range.These dwellings are pits about a foot deep, perpendicular at first and
then bent elbow-wise.On the edge of
the hole stands a kerb, formed of straw, bits and scraps of all sorts
and even small pebbles, the size of a hazel-nut.The whole is kept in
place and cemented with silk.Often, the Spider confines herself to
drawing together the dry blades of the nearest grass, which she ties
down with the straps from her spinnerets, without removing the blades
from the stems; often, also, she rejects this scaffolding in favour of
a masonry constructed of small stones.The nature of the kerb is
decided by the nature of the materials within the Lycosa's reach, in
the close neighbourhood of the building-yard.There is no selection:
everything meets with approval, provided that it be near at hand.The direction is perpendicular, in so far as obstacles, frequent in a
soil of this kind, permit.A bit of gravel can be extracted and hoisted
outside; but a flint is an immovable boulder which the Spider avoids by
giving a bend to her gallery.If more such are met with, the residence
becomes a winding cave, with stone vaults, with lobbies communicating
by means of sharp passages.This lack of plan has no attendant drawbacks, so well does the owner,
from long habit, know every corner and storey of her mansion.If any
interesting buzz occur overhead, the Lycosa climbs up from her rugged
manor with the same speed as from a vertical shaft.Perhaps she even
finds the windings and turnings an advantage, when she has to drag into
her den a prey that happens to defend itself.As a rule, the end of the burrow widens into a side-chamber, a lounge
or resting-place where the Spider meditates at length and is content to
lead a life of quiet when her belly is full.When she reaches maturity and is once settled, the Lycosa becomes
eminently domesticated.I have been living in close communion with her
for the last three years.I have installed her in large earthen pans on
the window-sills of my study and I have her daily under my eyes.Well,
it is very rarely that I happen on her outside, a few inches from her
hole, back to which she bolts at the least alarm.We may take it then that, when not in captivity, the Lycosa does not go
far afield to gather the wherewithal to build her parapet and that she
makes shift with what she finds upon her threshold.In these
conditions, the building-stones are soon exhausted and the masonry
ceases for lack of materials.The wish came over me to see what dimensions the circular edifice would
assume, if the Spider were given an unlimited supply.With captives to
whom I myself act as purveyor the thing is easy enough.Were it only
with a view to helping whoso may one day care to continue these
relations with the big Spider of the waste-lands, let me describe how
my subjects are housed.A good-sized earthenware pan, some nine inches deep, is filled with a
red, clayey earth, rich in pebbles, similar, in short, to that of the
places haunted by the Lycosa.Properly moistened into a paste, the
artificial soil is heaped, layer by layer, around a central reed, of a
bore equal to that of the animal's natural burrow.When the receptacle
is filled to the top, I withdraw the reed, which leaves a yawning,
perpendicular shaft.I thus obtain the abode which shall replace that
of the fields.To find the hermit to inhabit it is merely the matter of a walk in the
neighbourhood.When removed from her own dwelling, which is turned
topsy-turvy by my trowel, and placed in possession of the den produced
by my art, the Lycosa at once disappears into that den.She does not
come out again, seeks nothing better elsewhere.A large wire-gauze
cover rests on the soil in the pan and prevents escape.In any case, the watch, in this respect, makes no demand upon my
diligence.The prisoner is satisfied with her new abode and manifests
no regret for her natural burrow.There is no attempt at flight on her
part.Let me not omit to add that each pan must receive not more than
one inhabitant.To her a neighbour is
fair game, to be eaten without scruple when one has might on one's
side.Time was when, unaware of this fierce intolerance, which is more
savage still at breeding time, I saw hideous orgies perpetrated in my
overstocked cages.I shall have occasion to describe those tragedies
later.Let us meanwhile consider the isolated Lycosae.They do not touch up
the dwelling which I have moulded for them with a bit of reed; at most,
now and again, perhaps with the object of forming a lounge or bedroom
at the bottom, they fling out a few loads of rubbish.But all, little
by little, build the kerb that is to edge the mouth.I have given them plenty of first-rate materials, far superior to those
which they use when left to their own resources.These consist, first,
for the foundations, of little smooth stones, some of which are as
large as an almond.With this road-metal are mingled short strips of
raphia, or palm-fibre, flexible ribbons, easily bent.These stand for
the Spider's usual basket-work, consisting of slender stalks and dry
blades of grass.Lastly, by way of an unprecedented treasure, never yet
employed by a Lycosa, I place at my captives' disposal some thick
threads of wool, cut into inch lengths.As I wish, at the same time, to find out whether my animals, with the
magnificent lenses of their eyes, are able to distinguish colours and
prefer one colour to another, I mix up bits of wool of different hues:
there are red, green, white, and yellow pieces.If the Spider have any
preference, she can choose where she pleases.The Lycosa always works at night, a regrettable circumstance, which
does not allow me to follow the worker's methods.I see the result; and
that is all.Were I to visit the building-yard by the light of a
lantern, I should be no wiser.The Spider, who is very shy, would at
once dive into her lair; and I should have lost my sleep for nothing.Furthermore, she is not a very diligent labourer; she likes to take her
time.Two or three bits of wool or raphia placed in position represent
a whole night's work.And to this slowness we must add long spells of
utter idleness.Two months pass; and the result of my liberality surpasses my
expectations.Possessing more windfalls than they know what to do with,
all picked up in their immediate neighbourhood, my Lycosae have built
themselves donjon-keeps the like of which their race has not yet known.Around the orifice, on a slightly sloping bank, small, flat, smooth
stones have been laid to form a broken, flagged pavement.The larger
stones, which are Cyclopean blocks compared with the size of the animal
that has shifted them, are employed as abundantly as the others.It is an interlacing of raphia and
bits of wool, picked up at random, without distinction of shade.Red
and white, green and yellow are mixed without any attempt at order.The
Lycosa is indifferent to the joys of colour.The ultimate result is a sort of muff, a couple of inches high.Bands
of silk, supplied by the spinnerets, unite the pieces, so that the
whole resembles a coarse fabric.Without being absolutely faultless,
for there are always awkward pieces on the outside, which the worker
could not handle, the gaudy building is not devoid of merit.The bird
lining its nest would do no better.Whoso sees the curious,
many- productions in my pans takes them for an outcome of my
industry, contrived with a view to some experimental mischief; and his
surprise is great when I confess who the real author is.No one would
ever believe the Spider capable of constructing such a monument.It goes without saying that, in a state of liberty, on our barren
waste-lands, the Lycosa does not indulge in such sumptuous
architecture.I have given the reason: she is too great a stay-at-home
to go in search of materials and she makes use of the limited resources
which she finds around her.Bits of earth, small chips of stone, a few
twigs, a few withered grasses: that is all, or nearly all.Wherefore
the work is generally quite modest and reduced to a parapet that hardly
attracts attention.My captives teach us that, when materials are plentiful, especially
textile materials that remove all fears of landslip, the Lycosa
delights in tall turrets.She understands the art of donjon-building
and puts it into practice as often as she possesses the means.An
enthusiastic votary of the chase, so long as she is not permanently
fixed, the Lycosa, once she has set up house, prefers to lie in ambush
and wait for the quarry.Every day, when the heat is greatest, I see my
captives come up slowly from under ground and lean upon the battlements
of their woolly castle-keep.They are then really magnificent in their
stately gravity.With their swelling belly contained within the
aperture, their head outside, their glassy eyes staring, their legs
gathered for a spring, for hours and hours they wait, motionless,
bathing voluptuously in the sun.Should a tit-bit to her liking happen to pass, forthwith the watcher
darts from her tall tower, swift as an arrow from the bow.With a
dagger-thrust in the neck, she stabs the jugular of the Locust,
Dragon-fly or other prey whereof I am the purveyor; and she as quickly
scales the donjon and retires with her capture.The performance is a
wonderful exhibition of skill and speed.Very seldom is a quarry missed, provided that it pass at a convenient
distance, within the range of the huntress' bound.But, if the prey be
at some distance, for instance on the wire of the cage, the Lycosa
takes no notice of it.Scorning to go in pursuit, she allows it to roam
at will.She never strikes except when sure of her stroke.She achieves
this by means of her tower.Hiding behind the wall, she sees the
stranger advancing, keeps her eyes on him and suddenly pounces when he
comes within reach.Though he were winged and swift of flight, the unwary one who
approaches the ambush is lost.This presumes, it is true, an exemplary patience on the Lycosa's part;
for the burrow has naught that can serve to entice victims.At best,
the ledge provided by the turret may, at rare intervals, tempt some
weary wayfarer to use it as a resting-place.But, if the quarry do not
come to-day, it is sure to come to-morrow, the next day, or later, for
the Locusts hop innumerable in the waste-land, nor are they always able
to regulate their leaps.Some day or other, chance is bound to bring
one of them within the purlieus of the burrow.This is the moment to
spring upon the pilgrim from the ramparts.Until then, we maintain a
stoical vigilance.We shall dine when we can; but we shall end by
dining.The Lycosa, therefore, well aware of these lingering eventualities,
waits and is not unduly distressed by a prolonged abstinence.She has
an accommodating stomach, which is satisfied to be gorged to-day and to
remain empty afterwards for goodness knows how long.I have sometimes
neglected my catering duties for weeks at a time; and my boarders have
been none the worse for it.After a more or less protracted fast, they
do not pine away, but are smitten with a wolf-like hunger.All these
ravenous eaters are alike: they guzzle to excess to-day, in
anticipation of to-morrow's dearth.Chance, a poor stand-by, sometimes contrives very well.At the
beginning of the month of August, the children call me to the far side
of the enclosure, rejoicing in a find which they have made under the
rosemary-bushes.It is a magnificent Lycosa, with an enormous belly,
the sign of an impending delivery.Early one morning, ten days later, I find her preparing for her
confinement.A silk network is first spun on the ground, covering an
extent about equal to the palm of one's hand.It is coarse and
shapeless, but firmly fixed.This is the floor on which the Spider
means to operate.On this foundation, which acts as a protection from the sand, the
Lycosa fashions a round mat, the size of a two-franc piece and made of
superb white silk.With a gentle, uniform movement, which might be
regulated by the wheels of a delicate piece of clockwork, the tip of
the abdomen rises and falls, each time touching the supporting base a
little farther away, until the extreme scope of the mechanism is
attained.Then, without the Spider's moving her position, the oscillation is
resumed in the opposite direction.By means of this alternate motion,
interspersed with numerous contacts, a segment of the sheet is
obtained, of a very accurate texture.When this is done, the Spider
moves a little along a circular line and the loom works in the same
manner on another segment.The silk disk, a sort of hardy concave paten, now no longer receives
anything from the spinnerets in its centre; the marginal belt alone
increases in thickness.The piece thus becomes a bowl-shaped porringer,
surrounded by a wide, flat edge.With one quick emission, the viscous,
pale-yellow eggs are laid in the basin, where they heap together in the
shape of a globe which projects largely outside the cavity.The
spinnerets are once more set going.With short movements, as the tip of
the abdomen rises and falls to weave the round mat, they cover up the
exposed hemisphere.The result is a pill set in the middle of a
circular carpet.The legs, hitherto idle, are now working.They take up and break off
one by one the threads that keep the round mat stretched on the coarse
supporting network.At the same time the fangs grip this sheet, lift it
by degrees, tear it from its base and fold it over upon the globe of
eggs.The whole edifice totters, the floor
collapses, fouled with sand.By a movement of the legs, those soiled
shreds are cast aside.Briefly, by means of violent tugs of the fangs,
which pull, and broom-like efforts of the legs, which clear away, the
Lycosa extricates the bag of eggs and removes it as a clear-cut mass,
free from any adhesion.It is a white-silk pill, soft to the touch and glutinous.Its size is
that of an average cherry.An observant eye will notice, running
horizontally around the middle, a fold which a needle is able to raise
without breaking it.This hem, generally undistinguishable from the
rest of the surface, is none other than the edge of the circular mat,
drawn over the lower hemisphere.The other hemisphere, through which
the youngsters will go out, is less well fortified: its only wrapper is
the texture spun over the eggs immediately after they were laid.The work of spinning, followed by that of tearing, is continued for a
whole morning, from five to nine o'clock.Worn out with fatigue, the
mother embraces her dear pill and remains motionless.I shall see no
more to-day.Next morning, I find the Spider carrying the bag of eggs
slung from her stern.Henceforth, until the hatching, she does not leave go of the precious
burden, which, fastened to the spinnerets by a short ligament, drags
and bumps along the ground.With this load banging against her heels,
she goes about her business; she walks or rests, she seeks her prey,
attacks it and devours it.Should some accident cause the wallet to
drop off, it is soon replaced.The spinnerets touch it somewhere,
anywhere, and that is enough: adhesion is at once restored.When the work is done, some of them emancipate themselves, think they
will have a look at the country before retiring for good and all.It is
these whom we meet at times, wandering aimlessly and dragging their bag
behind them.Sooner or later, however, the vagrants return home; and
the month of August is not over before a straw rustled in any burrow
will bring the mother up, with her wallet slung behind her.I am able
to procure as many as I want and, with them, to indulge in certain
experiments of the highest interest.It is a sight worth seeing, that of the Lycosa dragging her treasure
after her, never leaving it, day or night, sleeping or waking, and
defending it with a courage that strikes the beholder with awe.If I
try to take the bag from her, she presses it to her breast in despair,
hangs on to my pincers, bites them with her poison-fangs.I can hear
the daggers grating on the steel.No, she would not allow herself to be
robbed of the wallet with impunity, if my fingers were not supplied
with an implement.By dint of pulling and shaking the pill with the forceps, I take it
from the Lycosa, who protests furiously.I fling her in exchange a pill
taken from another Lycosa.It is at once seized in the fangs, embraced
by the legs and hung on to the spinneret.Her own or another's: it is
all one to the Spider, who walks away proudly with the alien wallet.This was to be expected, in view of the similarity of the pills
exchanged.A test of another kind, with a second subject, renders the mistake more
striking.I substitute, in the place of the lawful bag which I have
removed, the work of the Silky Epeira.The colour and softness of the
material are the same in both cases; but the shape is quite different.The stolen object is a globe; the object presented in exchange is an
elliptical conoid studded with angular projections along the edge of
the base.The Spider takes no account of this dissimilarity.She
promptly glues the queer bag to her spinnerets and is as pleased as
though she were in possession of her real pill.My experimental
villainies have no other consequence beyond an ephemeral carting.When
hatching-time arrives, early in the case of Lycosa, late in that of the
Epeira, the gulled Spider abandons the strange bag and pays it no
further attention.Let us penetrate yet deeper into the wallet-bearer's stupidity.After
depriving the Lycosa of her eggs, I throw her a ball of cork, roughly
polished with a file and of the same size as the stolen pill.She
accepts the corky substance, so different from the silk purse, without
the least demur.One would have thought that she would recognize her
mistake with those eight eyes of hers, which gleam like precious
stones.Lovingly she embraces the
cork ball, fondles it with her palpi, fastens it to her spinnerets and
thenceforth drags it after her as though she were dragging her own bag.Let us give another the choice between the imitation and the real.The
rightful pill and the cork ball are placed together on the floor of the
jar.Will the Spider be able to know the one that belongs to her?The
fool is incapable of doing so.She makes a wild rush and seizes
haphazard at one time her property, at another my sham product.Whatever is first touched becomes a good capture and is forthwith hung
up.If I increase the number of cork balls, if I put in four or five of
them, with the real pill among them, it is seldom that the Lycosa
recovers her own property.Attempts at inquiry, attempts at selection
there are none.Whatever she snaps up at random she sticks to, be it
good or bad.As there are more of the sham pills of cork, these are the
most often seized by the Spider.Can the animal be deceived by the soft
contact of the cork?I replace the cork balls by pellets of cotton or
paper, kept in their round shape with a few bands of thread.Both are
very readily accepted instead of the real bag that has been removed.Can the illusion be due to the colouring, which is light in the cork
and not unlike the tint of the silk globe when soiled with a little
earth, while it is white in the paper and the cotton, when it is
identical with that of the original pill?I give the Lycosa, in
exchange for her work, a pellet of silk thread, chosen of a fine red,
the brightest of all colours.The uncommon pill is as readily accepted
and as jealously guarded as the others.For three weeks and more the Lycosa trails the bag of eggs hanging to
her spinnerets.The reader will remember the experiments described in
the preceding section, particularly those with the cork ball and the
thread pellet which the Spider so foolishly accepts in exchange for the
real pill.Well, this exceedingly dull-witted mother, satisfied with
aught that knocks against her heels, is about to make us wonder at her
devotion.Whether she come up from her shaft to lean upon the kerb and bask in
the sun, whether she suddenly retire underground in the face of danger,
or whether she be roaming the country before settling down, never does
she let go her precious bag, that very cumbrous burden in walking,
climbing or leaping.If, by some accident, it become detached from the
fastening to which it is hung, she flings herself madly on her treasure
and lovingly embraces it, ready to bite whoso would take it from her.I then hear the points of the
poison-fangs grinding against the steel of my pincers, which tug in one
direction while the Lycosa tugs in the other.But let us leave the
animal alone: with a quick touch of the spinnerets, the pill is
restored to its place; and the Spider strides off, still menacing.Towards the end of summer, all the householders, old or young, whether
in captivity on the window-sill or at liberty in the paths of the
enclosure, supply me daily with the following improving sight.In the
morning, as soon as the sun is hot and beats upon their burrow, the
anchorites come up from the bottom with their bag and station
themselves at the opening.Long siestas on the threshold in the sun are
the order of the day throughout the fine season; but, at the present
time, the position adopted is a different one.Formerly, the Lycosa
came out into the sun for her own sake.Leaning on the parapet, she had
the front half of her body outside the pit and the hinder half inside.The eyes took their fill of light; the belly remained in the dark.When
carrying her egg-bag, the Spider reverses the posture: the front is in
the pit, the rear outside.With her hind-legs she holds the white pill
bulging with germs lifted above the entrance; gently she turns and
turns it, so as to present every side to the life-giving rays.And this
goes on for half the day, so long as the temperature is high; and it is
repeated daily, with exquisite patience, during three or four weeks.To
hatch its eggs, the bird covers them with the quilt of its breast; it
strains them to the furnace of its heart.The Lycosa turns hers in
front of the hearth of hearths: she gives them the sun as an incubator.In the early days of September the young ones, who have been some time
hatched, are ready to come out.The whole family emerges from the bag straightway.Then and there, the
youngsters climb to the mother's back.As for the empty bag, now a
worthless shred, it is flung out of the burrow; the Lycosa does not
give it a further thought.Huddled together, sometimes in two or three
layers, according to their number, the little ones cover the whole back
of the mother, who, for seven or eight months to come, will carry her
family night and day.Nowhere can we hope to see a more edifying
domestic picture than that of the Lycosa clothed in her young.From time to time I meet a little band of gipsies passing along the
high-road on their way to some neighbouring fair.The new-born babe
mewls on the mother's breast, in a hammock formed out of a kerchief.The last-weaned is carried pick-a-back; a third toddles clinging to its
mother's skirts; others follow closely, the biggest in the rear,
ferreting in the blackberry-laden hedgerows.It is a magnificent
spectacle of happy-go-lucky fruitfulness.They go their way, penniless
and rejoicing.The sun is hot and the earth is fertile.But how this picture pales before that of the Lycosa, that incomparable
gipsy whose brats are numbered by the hundred!And one and all of them,
from September to April, without a moment's respite, find room upon the
patient creature's back, where they are content to lead a tranquil life
and to be carted about.The little ones are very good; none moves, none seeks a quarrel with
his neighbours.Clinging together, they form a continuous drapery, a
shaggy ulster under which the mother becomes unrecognizable.Is it an
animal, a fluff of wool, a cluster of small seeds fastened to one
another?'Tis impossible to tell at the first glance.The equilibrium of this living blanket is not so firm but that falls
often occur, especially when the mother climbs from indoors and comes
to the threshold to let the little ones take the sun.The least brush
against the gallery unseats a part of the family.The Hen, fidgeting about her Chicks, looks for the strays,
calls them, gathers them together.The Lycosa knows not these maternal
alarms.Impassively, she leaves those who drop off to manage their own
difficulty, which they do with wonderful quickness.Commend me to those
youngsters for getting up without whining, dusting themselves and
resuming their seat in the saddle!The unhorsed ones promptly find a
leg of the mother, the usual climbing-pole; they swarm up it as fast as
they can and recover their places on the bearer's back.The living bark
of animals is reconstructed in the twinkling of an eye.To speak here of mother-love were, I think, extravagant.The Lycosa's
affection for her offspring hardly surpasses that of the plant, which
is unacquainted with any tender feeling and nevertheless bestows the
nicest and most delicate care upon its seeds.The animal, in many
cases, knows no other sense of motherhood.What cares the Lycosa for
her brood!She accepts another's as readily as her own; she is
satisfied so long as her back is burdened with a swarming crowd,
whether it issue from her ovaries or elsewhere.There is no question
here of real maternal affection.I have described elsewhere the prowess of the Copris watching over
cells that are not her handiwork and do not contain her offspring.With
a zeal which even the additional labour laid upon her does not easily
weary, she removes the mildew from the alien dung-balls, which far
exceed the regular nests in number; she gently scrapes and polishes and
repairs them; she listens attentively and enquires by ear into each
nurseling's progress.Her real collection could not receive greater
care.Her own family or another's: it is all one to her.I take a hair-pencil and sweep the
living burden from one of my Spiders, making it fall close to another
covered with her little ones.The evicted youngsters scamper about,
find the new mother's legs outspread, nimbly clamber up these and mount
on the back of the obliging creature, who quietly lets them have their
way.They slip in among the others, or, when the layer is too thick,
push to the front and pass from the abdomen to the thorax and even to
the head, though leaving the region of the eyes uncovered.It does not
do to blind the bearer: the common safety demands that.They know this
and respect the lenses of the eyes, however populous the assembly be.The whole animal is now covered with a swarming carpet of young, all
except the legs, which must preserve their freedom of action, and the
under part of the body, where contact with the ground is to be feared.My pencil forces a third family upon the already over-burdened Spider;
and this too is peacefully accepted.The youngsters huddle up closer,
lie one on top of the other in layers and room is found for all.The
Lycosa has lost the last semblance of an animal, has become a nameless
bristling thing that walks about.Falls are frequent and are followed
by continual climbings.I perceive that I have reached the limits, not of the bearer's
good-will, but of equilibrium.The Spider would adopt an indefinite
further number of foundlings, if the dimensions of her back afforded
them a firm hold.Let us restore each
family to its mother, drawing at random from the lot.There must
necessarily be interchanges, but that is of no importance: real
children and adopted children are the same thing in the Lycosa's eyes.One would like to know if, apart from my artifices, in circumstances
where I do not interfere, the good-natured dry-nurse sometimes burdens
herself with a supplementary family; it would also be interesting to
learn what comes of this association of lawful offspring and strangers.I have ample materials wherewith to obtain an answer to both questions.I have housed in the same cage two elderly matrons laden with
youngsters.Each has her home as far removed from the other's as the
size of the common pan permits.Proximity soon kindles fierce jealousies between those
intolerant creatures, who are obliged to live far apart so as to secure
adequate hunting-grounds.One morning I catch the two harridans fighting out their quarrel on the
floor.The loser is laid flat upon her back; the victress, belly to
belly with her adversary, clutches her with her legs and prevents her
from moving a limb.Both have their poison-fangs wide open, ready to
bite without yet daring, so mutually formidable are they.After a
certain period of waiting, during which the pair merely exchange
threats, the stronger of the two, the one on top, closes her lethal
engine and grinds the head of the prostrate foe.Then she calmly
devours the deceased by small mouthfuls.Now what do the youngsters do, while their mother is being eaten?Easily consoled, heedless of the atrocious scene, they climb on the
conqueror's back and quietly take their places among the lawful family.The ogress raises no objection, accepts them as her own.She makes a
meal off the mother and adopts the orphans.Let us add that, for many months yet, until the final emancipation
comes, she will carry them without drawing any distinction between them
and her own young.Henceforth the two families, united in so tragic a
fashion, will form but one.We see how greatly out of place it would be
to speak, in this connection, of mother-love and its fond
manifestations.Does the Lycosa at least feed the younglings who, for seven months,
swarm upon her back?Does she invite them to the banquet when she has
secured a prize?I thought so at first; and, anxious to assist at the
family repast, I devoted special attention to watching the mothers eat.As a rule, the prey is consumed out of sight, in the burrow; but
sometimes also a meal is taken on the threshold, in the open air.Besides, it is easy to rear the Lycosa and her family in a wire-gauze
cage, with a layer of earth wherein the captive will never dream of
sinking a well, such work being out of season.Well, while the mother munches, chews, expresses the juices and
swallows, the youngsters do not budge from their camping-ground on her
back.Not one quits its place nor gives a sign of wishing to slip down
and join in the meal.Nor does the mother extend an invitation to them
to come and recruit themselves, nor put any broken victuals aside for
them.She feeds and the others look on, or rather remain indifferent to
what is happening.Their perfect quiet during the Lycosa's feast points
to the possession of a stomach that knows no cravings.Then with what are they sustained, during their seven months'
upbringing on the mother's back?One conceives a notion of exudations
supplied by the bearer's body, in which case the young would feed on
their mother, after the manner of parasitic vermin, and gradually drain
her strength.Never are they seen to put their mouths to
the skin that should be a sort of teat to them.On the other hand, the
Lycosa, far from being exhausted and shrivelling, keeps perfectly well
and plump.She has the same pot-belly when she finishes rearing her
young as when she began.She has not lost weight: far from it; on the
contrary, she has put on flesh: she has gained the wherewithal to beget
a new family next summer, one as numerous as to-day's.Once more, with what do the little ones keep up their strength?We do
not like to suggest reserves supplied by the egg as rectifying the
animal's expenditure of vital force, especially when we consider that
those reserves, themselves so close to nothing, must be economized in
view of the silk, a material of the highest importance, of which a
plentiful use will be made presently.There must be other powers at
play in the tiny animal's machinery.Total abstinence from food could be understood, if it were accompanied
by inertia: immobility is not life.But the young Lycosae, though
usually quiet on their mother's back, are at all times ready for
exercise and for agile swarming.When they fall from the maternal
perambulator, they briskly pick themselves up, briskly scramble up a
leg and make their way to the top.It is a splendidly nimble and
spirited performance.Besides, once seated, they have to keep a firm
balance in the mass; they have to stretch and stiffen their little
limbs in order to hang on to their neighbours.As a matter of fact,
there is no absolute rest for them.Now physiology teaches us that not
a fibre works without some expenditure of energy.The animal, which can
be likened, in no small measure, to our industrial machines, demands,
on the one hand, the renovation of its organism, which wears out with
movement, and, on the other, the maintenance of the heat transformed
into action.We can compare it with the locomotive-engine.As the iron
horse performs its work, it gradually wears out its pistons, its rods,
its wheels, its boiler-tubes, all of which have to be made good from
time to time.The founder and the smith repair it, supply it, so to
speak, with 'plastic food,' the food that becomes embodied with the
whole and forms part of it.But, though it have just come from the
engine-shop, it is still inert.To acquire the power of movement it
must receive from the stoker a supply of 'energy-producing food'; in
other words, he lights a few shovelfuls of coal in its inside.As nothing is made from nothing, the egg
supplies first the materials of the new-born animal; then the plastic
food, the smith of living creatures, increases the body, up to a
certain limit, and renews it as it wears away.The stoker works at the
same time, without stopping.Fuel, the source of energy, makes but a
short stay in the system, where it is consumed and furnishes heat,
whence movement is derived.Warmed by its food, the
animal machine moves, walks, runs, jumps, swims, flies, sets its
locomotory apparatus going in a thousand manners.To return to the young Lycosae, they grow no larger until the period of
their emancipation.I find them at the age of seven months the same as
when I saw them at their birth.The egg supplied the materials
necessary for their tiny frames; and, as the loss of waste substance
is, for the moment, excessively small, or even nil, additional plastic
food is not needed so long as the wee creature does not grow.In this
respect, the prolonged abstinence presents no difficulty.But there
remains the question of energy-producing food, which is indispensable,
for the little Lycosa moves, when necessary, and very actively at that.To what shall we attribute the heat expended upon action, when the
animal takes absolutely no nourishment?We say to ourselves that, without being life,
a machine is something more than matter, for man has added a little of
his mind to it.Now the iron beast, consuming its ration of coal, is
really browsing the ancient foliage of arborescent ferns in which solar
energy has accumulated.Beasts of flesh and blood act no otherwise.Whether they mutually
devour one another or levy tribute on the plant, they invariably
quicken themselves with the stimulant of the sun's heat, a heat stored
in grass, fruit, seed and those which feed on such.The sun, the soul
of the universe, is the supreme dispenser of energy.Instead of being served up through the intermediary of food and passing
through the ignominious circuit of gastric chemistry, could not this
solar energy penetrate the animal directly and charge it with activity,
even as the battery charges an accumulator with power?Why not live on
sun, seeing that, after all, we find naught but sun in the fruits which
we consume?Chemical science, that bold revolutionary, promises to provide us with
synthetic foodstuffs.The laboratory and the factory will take the
place of the farm.Why should not physical science step in as well?It
would leave the preparation of plastic food to the chemist's retorts;
it would reserve for itself that of energy-producing food which,
reduced to its exact terms, ceases to be matter.With the aid of some
ingenious apparatus, it would pump into us our daily ration of solar
energy, to be later expended in movement, whereby the machine would be
kept going without the often painful assistance of the stomach and its
adjuncts.What a delightful world, where one could lunch off a ray of
sunshine!Is it a dream, or the anticipation of a remote reality?The problem is
one of the most important that science can set us.Let us first hear
the evidence of the young Lycosae regarding its possibilities.For seven months, without any material nourishment, they expend
strength in moving.To wind up the mechanism of their muscles, they
recruit themselves direct with heat and light.During the time when she
was dragging the bag of eggs behind her, the mother, at the best
moments of the day, came and held up her pill to the sun.With her two
hind-legs she lifted it out of the ground into the full light; slowly
she turned it and turned it, so that every side might receive its share
of the vivifying rays.Well, this bath of life, which awakened the
germs, is now prolonged to keep the tender babes active.Daily, if the sky be clear, the Lycosa, carrying her young, comes up
from the burrow, leans on the kerb and spends long hours basking in the
sun.Here, on their mother's back, the youngsters stretch their limbs
delightedly, saturate themselves with heat, take in reserves of
motor-power, absorb energy.They are motionless; but, if I only blow upon them, they stampede as
nimbly as though a hurricane were passing.Hurriedly, they disperse;
hurriedly, they reassemble: a proof that, without material nourishment,
the little animal machine is always at full pressure, ready to work.When the shade comes, mother and sons go down again, surfeited with
solar emanations.The feast of energy at the Sun Tavern is finished for
the day.The fowling-snare is one of man's ingenious villainies.With lines,
pegs and poles, two large, earth- nets are stretched upon the
ground, one to the right, the other to the left of a bare surface.A
long cord, pulled at the right moment by the fowler, who hides in a
brushwood hut, works them and brings them together suddenly, like a
pair of shutters.Divided between the two nets are the cages of the decoy-birds--Linnets
and Chaffinches, Greenfinches and Yellowhammers, Buntings and
Ortolans--sharp-eared creatures which, on perceiving the distant
passage of a flock of their own kind, forthwith utter a short calling
note.One of them, the Sambe, an irresistible tempter, hops about and
flaps his wings in apparent freedom.A bit of twine fastens him to his
convict's stake.When, worn with fatigue and driven desperate by his
vain attempts to get away, the sufferer lies down flat and refuses to
do his duty, the fowler is able to stimulate him without stirring from
his hut.A long string sets in motion a little lever working on a
pivot.Raised from the ground by this diabolical contrivance, the bird
flies, falls down and flies up again at each jerk of the cord.The fowler waits, in the mild sunlight of the autumn morning.The Chaffinches chirp their rallying
cry:

"Pinck!They are
coming, the simpletons; they swoop down upon the treacherous floor.With a rapid movement, the man in ambush pulls his string.The nets
close and the whole flock is caught.Man has wild beast's blood in his veins.The fowler hastens to the
slaughter.With his thumb he stifles the beating of the captives'
hearts, staves in their skulls.The little birds, so many piteous heads
of game, will go to market, strung in dozens on a wire passed through
their nostrils.For scoundrelly ingenuity, the Epeira's net can bear comparison with
the fowler's; it even surpasses it when, on patient study, the main
features of its supreme perfection stand revealed.What refinement of
art for a mess of Flies!Nowhere, in the whole animal kingdom, has the
need to eat inspired a more cunning industry.If the reader will
meditate upon the description that follows, he will certainly share my
admiration.In bearing and colouring, Epeira fasciata is the handsomest of the
Spiders of the South.On her fat belly, a mighty silk-warehouse nearly
as large as a hazel-nut, are alternate yellow, black and silver sashes,
to which she owes her epithet of Banded.Around that portly abdomen the
eight long legs, with their dark- and pale-brown rings, radiate like
spokes.Any small prey suits her; and, as long as she can find supports for her
web, she settles wherever the Locust hops, wherever the Fly hovers,
wherever the Dragon-fly dances or the Butterfly flits.As a rule,
because of the greater abundance of game, she spreads her toils across
some brooklet, from bank to bank among the rushes.She also stretches
them, but not so assiduously, in the thickets of evergreen oak, on the
<DW72>s with the scrubby greenswards, dear to the Grasshoppers.Her hunting-weapon is a large upright web, whose outer boundary, which
varies according to the disposition of the ground, is fastened to the
neighbouring branches by a number of moorings.Let us see, first of
all, how the ropes which form the framework of the building are
obtained.All day invisible, crouching amid the cypress-leaves, the Spider, at
about eight o'clock in the evening, solemnly emerges from her retreat
and makes for the top of a branch.In this exalted position she sits
for sometime laying her plans with due regard to the locality; she
consults the weather, ascertains if the night will be fine.Then,
suddenly, with her eight legs widespread, she lets herself drop
straight down, hanging to the line that issues from her spinnerets.Just as the rope-maker obtains the even output of his hemp by walking
backwards, so does the Epeira obtain the discharge of hers by falling.It is extracted by the weight of her body.The descent, however, has not the brute speed which the force of
gravity would give it, if uncontrolled.It is governed by the action of
the spinnerets, which contract or expand their pores, or close them
entirely, at the faller's pleasure.And so, with gentle moderation, she
pays out this living plumb-line, of which my lantern clearly shows me
the plumb, but not always the line.The great squab seems at such times
to be sprawling in space, without the least support.She comes to an abrupt stop two inches from the ground; the silk-reel
ceases working.The Spider turns round, clutches the line which she has
just obtained and climbs up by this road, still spinning.But, this
time, as she is no longer assisted by the force of gravity, the thread
is extracted in another manner.The two hind-legs, with a quick
alternate action, draw it from the wallet and let it go.On returning to her starting-point, at a height of six feet or more,
the Spider is now in possession of a double line, bent into a loop and
floating loosely in a current of air.She fixes her end where it suits
her and waits until the other end, wafted by the wind, has fastened its
loop to the adjacent twigs.Feeling her thread fixed, the Epeira runs along it repeatedly, from end
to end, adding a fibre to it on each journey.Whether I help or not,
this forms the "suspension cable," the main piece of the framework.I
call it a cable, in spite of its extreme thinness, because of its
structure.It looks as though it were single, but, at the two ends, it
is seen to divide and spread, tuft-wise, into numerous constituent
parts, which are the product of as many crossings.These diverging
fibres, with their several contact-points, increase the steadiness of
the two extremities.The suspension-cable is incomparably stronger than the rest of the work
and lasts for an indefinite time.The web is generally shattered after
the night's hunting and is nearly always rewoven on the following
evening.After the removal of the wreckage, it is made all over again,
on the same site, cleared of everything except the cable from which the
new network is to hang.Once the cable is laid, in this way or in that, the Spider is in
possession of a base that allows her to approach or withdraw from the
leafy piers at will.From the height of the cable she lets herself slip
to a slight depth, varying the points of her fall.In this way she
obtains, to right and left, a few slanting cross-bars, connecting the
cable with the branches.These cross-bars, in their turn, support others in ever changing
directions.When there are enough of them, the Epeira need no longer
resort to falls in order to extract her threads; she goes from one cord
to the next, always wire-drawing with her hind-legs.This results in a
combination of straight lines owning no order, save that they are kept
in one nearly perpendicular plane.Thus is marked out a very irregular
polygonal area, wherein the web, itself a work of magnificent
regularity, shall presently be woven.In the lower part of the web, starting from the centre, a wide opaque
ribbon descends zigzag-wise across the radii.This is the Epeira's
trade-mark, the flourish of an artist initialling his creation."Fecit
So-and-so," she seems to say, when giving the last throw of the shuttle
to her handiwork.That the Spider feels satisfied when, after passing and repassing from
spoke to spoke, she finishes her spiral, is beyond a doubt: the work
achieved ensures her food for a few days to come.But, in this
particular case, the vanity of the spinstress has naught to say to the
matter: the strong silk zigzag is added to impart greater firmness to
the web.The spiral network of the Epeirae possesses contrivances of fearsome
cunning.The thread that forms it is seen with the naked eye to differ
from that of the framework and the spokes.It glitters in the sun,
looks as though it were knotted and gives the impression of a chaplet
of atoms.To examine it through the lens on the web itself is scarcely
feasible, because of the shaking of the fabric, which trembles at the
least breath.By passing a sheet of glass under the web and lifting it,
I take away a few pieces of thread to study, pieces that remain fixed
to the glass in parallel lines.Lens and microscope can now play their
part.Those threads, on the borderland
between the visible and the invisible, are very closely twisted twine,
similar to the gold cord of our officers' sword-knots.The infinitely slender is a tube, a channel full of a
viscous moisture resembling a strong solution of gum arabic.I can see
a diaphanous trail of this moisture trickling through the broken ends.Under the pressure of the thin glass slide that covers them on the
stage of the microscope, the twists lengthen out, become crinkled
ribbons, traversed from end to end, through the middle, by a dark
streak, which is the empty container.The fluid contents must ooze slowly through the side of those tubular
threads, rolled into twisted strings, and thus render the network
sticky.It is sticky, in fact, and in such a way as to provoke
surprise.I bring a fine straw flat down upon three or four rungs of a
sector.However gentle the contact, adhesion is at once established.When I lift the straw, the threads come with it and stretch to twice or
three times their length, like a thread of india-rubber.At last, when
over-taut, they loosen without breaking and resume their original form.They lengthen by unrolling their twist, they shorten by rolling it
again; lastly, they become adhesive by taking the glaze of the gummy
moisture wherewith they are filled.In short, the spiral thread is a capillary tube finer than any that our
physics will ever know.It is rolled into a twist so as to possess an
elasticity that allows it, without breaking, to yield to the tugs of
the captured prey; it holds a supply of sticky matter in reserve in its
tube, so as to renew the adhesive properties of the surface by
incessant exudation, as they become impaired by exposure to the air.The Epeira hunts not with springs, but with lime-snares.Everything is caught in them, down to the dandelion-plume
that barely brushes against them.Nevertheless, the Epeira, who is in
constant touch with her web, is not caught in them.Because the
Spider has contrived for herself, in the middle of her trap, a floor in
whose construction the sticky spiral thread plays no part.There is
here, covering a space which, in the larger webs, is about equal to the
palm of one's hand, a neutral fabric in which the exploring straw finds
no adhesiveness anywhere.Here, on this central resting-floor, and here only, the Epeira takes
her stand, waiting whole days for the arrival of the game.However
close, however prolonged her contact with this portion of the web, she
runs no risk of sticking to it, because the gummy coating is lacking,
as is the twisted and tubular structure, throughout the length of the
spokes and throughout the extent of the auxiliary spiral.These pieces,
together with the rest of the framework, are made of plain, straight,
solid thread.But when a victim is caught, sometimes right at the edge of the web,
the Spider has to rush up quickly, to bind it and overcome its attempts
to free itself.She is walking then upon her network; and I do not find
that she suffers the least inconvenience.The lime-threads are not even
lifted by the movements of her legs.In my boyhood, when a troop of us would go, on Thursdays (The weekly
half-day in French schools.--Translator's Note.), to try and catch a
Goldfinch in the hemp-fields, we used, before covering the twigs with
glue, to grease our fingers with a few drops of oil, lest we should get
them caught in the sticky matter.Does the Epeira know the secret of
fatty substances?I rub my exploring straw with slightly oiled paper.When applied to the
spiral thread of the web, it now no longer sticks to it.I pull out the leg of a live Epeira.Brought just as it
is into contact with the lime-threads, it does not stick to them any
more than to the neutral cords, whether spokes or part of the
framework.We were entitled to expect this, judging by the Spider's
general immunity.But here is something that wholly alters the result.I put the leg to
soak for a quarter of an hour in disulphide of carbon, the best solvent
of fatty matters.I wash it carefully with a brush dipped in the same
fluid.When this washing is finished, the leg sticks to the
snaring-thread quite easily and adheres to it just as well as anything
else would, the unoiled straw, for instance.Did I guess aright when I judged that it was a fatty substance that
preserved the Epeira from the snares of her sticky Catherine-wheel?The
action of the carbon-disulphide seems to say yes.Besides, there is no
reason why a substance of this kind, which plays so frequent a part in
animal economy, should not coat the Spider very slightly by the mere
act of perspiration.We used to rub our fingers with a little oil
before handling the twigs in which the Goldfinch was to be caught; even
so the Epeira varnishes herself with a special sweat, to operate on any
part of her web without fear of the lime-threads.However, an unduly protracted stay on the sticky threads would have its
drawbacks.In the long run, continual contact with those threads might
produce a certain adhesion and inconvenience to the Spider, who must
preserve all her agility in order to rush upon the prey before it can
release itself.For this reason, gummy threads are never used in
building the post of interminable waiting.It is only on her resting-floor that the Epeira sits, motionless and
with her eight legs outspread, ready to mark the least quiver in the
net.It is here, again, that she takes her meals, often long-drawn out,
when the joint is a substantial one; it is hither that, after trussing
and nibbling it, she drags her prey at the end of a thread, to consume
it at her ease on a non-viscous mat.As a hunting-post and refectory,
the Epeira has contrived a central space, free from glue.As for the glue itself, it is hardly possible to study its chemical
properties, because the quantity is so slight.The microscope shows it
trickling from the broken threads in the form of a transparent and more
or less granular streak.The following experiment will tell us more
about it.With a sheet of glass passed across the web, I gather a series of
lime-threads which remain fixed in parallel lines.I cover this sheet
with a bell-jar standing in a depth of water.Soon, in this atmosphere
saturated with humidity, the threads become enveloped in a watery
sheath, which gradually increases and begins to flow.The twisted shape
has by this time disappeared; and the channel of the thread reveals a
chaplet of translucent orbs, that is to say, a series of extremely fine
drops.In twenty-four hours the threads have lost their contents and are
reduced to almost invisible streaks.If I then lay a drop of water on
the glass, I get a sticky solution similar to that which a particle of
gum arabic might yield.The conclusion is evident: the Epeira's glue is
a substance that absorbs moisture freely.In an atmosphere with a high
degree of humidity, it becomes saturated and percolates by sweating
through the side of the tubular threads.These data explain certain facts relating to the work of the net.The
Epeirae weave at very early hours, long before dawn.Should the air
turn misty, they sometimes leave that part of the task unfinished: they
build the general framework, they lay the spokes, they even draw the
auxiliary spiral, for all these parts are unaffected by excess of
moisture; but they are very careful not to work at the lime-threads,
which, if soaked by the fog, would dissolve into sticky shreds and lose
their efficacy by being wetted.The net that was started will be
finished to-morrow, if the atmosphere be favourable.While the highly-absorbent character of the snaring-thread has its
drawbacks, it also has compensating advantages.The Epeirae, when
hunting by day, affect those hot places, exposed to the fierce rays of
the sun, wherein the Crickets delight.In the torrid heats of the
dog-days, therefore, the lime-threads, but for special provisions,
would be liable to dry up, to shrivel into stiff and lifeless
filaments.At the most scorching times
of the day they continue supple, elastic and more and more adhesive.The
moisture of which the air is never deprived penetrates them slowly; it
dilutes the thick contents of their tubes to the requisite degree and
causes it to ooze through, as and when the earlier stickiness
decreases.What bird-catcher could vie with the Garden Spider in the
art of laying lime-snares?And all this industry and cunning for the
capture of a Moth!I should like an anatomist endowed with better implements than mine and
with less tired eyesight to explain to us the work of the marvellous
rope-yard.How is the silken matter moulded into a capillary tube?How
is this tube filled with glue and tightly twisted?And how does this
same mill also turn out plain threads, wrought first into a framework
and then into muslin and satin?What a number of products to come from
that curious factory, a Spider's belly!I behold the results, but fail
to understand the working of the machine.I leave the problem to the
masters of the microtome and the scalpel.The Epeirae are monuments of patience in their lime-snare.With her
head down and her eight legs widespread, the Spider occupies the centre
of the web, the receiving-point of the information sent along the
spokes.If anywhere, behind or before, a vibration occur, the sign of a
capture, the Epeira knows about it, even without the aid of sight.Until then, not a movement: one would think that the animal was
hypnotized by her watching.At most, on the appearance of anything
suspicious, she begins shaking her nest.This is her way of inspiring
the intruder with awe.If I myself wish to provoke the singular alarm,
I have but to tease the Epeira with a bit of straw.You cannot have a
swing without an impulse of some sort.The terror-stricken Spider, who
wishes to strike terror into others, has hit upon something much
better.With nothing to push her, she swings with the floor of ropes.There is no effort, no visible exertion.Not a single part of the
animal moves; and yet everything trembles.When calm is restored, she resumes her attitude, ceaselessly pondering
the harsh problem of life:

"Shall I dine to-day, or not?"Certain privileged beings, exempt from those anxieties, have food in
abundance and need not struggle to obtain it.Such is the Gentle, who
swims blissfully in the broth of the putrefying Adder.Others--and, by
a strange irony of fate, these are generally the most gifted--only
manage to eat by dint of craft and patience.You are of their company, O my industrious Epeirae!So that you may
dine, you spend your treasures of patience nightly; and often without
result.I sympathize with your woes, for I, who am as concerned as you
about my daily bread, I also doggedly spread my net, the net for
catching ideas, a more elusive and less substantial prize than the
Moth.The best part of life is not in the
present, still less in the past; it lies in the future, the domain of
hope.All day long, the sky, of a uniform grey, has appeared to be brewing a
storm.In spite of the threatened downpour, my neighbour, who is a
shrewd weather-prophet, has come out of the cypress-tree and begun to
renew her web at the regular hour.Her forecast is correct: it will be
a fine night.See, the steaming-pan of the clouds splits open; and,
through the apertures, the moon peeps, inquisitively.I too, lantern in
hand, am peeping.A gust of wind from the north clears the realms on
high; the sky becomes magnificent; perfect calm reigns below.The
Spider will dine to-day.What happens next, in an uncertain light, does not lend itself to
accurate observation.It is better to turn to those Garden Spiders who
never leave their web and who hunt mainly in the daytime.The Banded
and the Silky Epeira, both of whom live on the rosemaries in the
enclosure, shall show us in broad daylight the innermost details of the
tragedy.I myself place on the lime-snare a victim of my selecting.Its six legs
are caught without more ado.If the insect raises one of its tarsi and
pulls towards itself, the treacherous thread follows, unwinds slightly
and, without letting go or breaking, yields to the captive's desperate
jerks.Any limb released only tangles the others still more and is
speedily recaptured by the sticky matter.There is no means of escape,
except by smashing the trap with a sudden effort whereof even powerful
insects are not always capable.Warned by the shaking of the net, the Epeira hastens up; she turns
round about the quarry; she inspects it at a distance, so as to
ascertain the extent of the danger before attacking.The strength of
the snareling will decide the plan of campaign.Let us first suppose
the usual case, that of an average head of game, a Moth or Fly of some
sort.Facing her prisoner, the Spider contracts her abdomen slightly
and touches the insect for a moment with the end of her spinnerets;
then, with her front tarsi, she sets her victim spinning.The Squirrel,
in the moving cylinder of his cage, does not display a more graceful or
nimbler dexterity.A cross-bar of the sticky spiral serves as an axis
for the tiny machine, which turns, turns swiftly, like a spit.It is a
treat to the eyes to see it revolve.It is this: the brief
contact of the spinnerets has given a starting-point for a thread,
which the Spider must now draw from her silk warehouse and gradually
roll around the captive, so as to swathe him in a winding-sheet which
will overpower any effort made.It is the exact process employed in our
wire-mills: a motor-driven spool revolves and, by its action, draws the
wire through the narrow eyelet of a steel plate, making it of the
fineness required, and, with the same movement, winds it round and
round its collar.Even so with the Epeira's work.The Spider's front tarsi are the motor;
the revolving spool is the captured insect; the steel eyelet is the
aperture of the spinnerets.To bind the subject with precision and
dispatch nothing could be better than this inexpensive and highly
effective method.With a quick movement,
the Spider herself turns round about the motionless insect, crossing
the web first at the top and then at the bottom and gradually placing
the fastenings of her line.The great elasticity of the lime-threads
allows the Epeira to fling herself time after time right into the web
and to pass through it without damaging the net.Let us now suppose the case of some dangerous game: a Praying Mantis,
for instance, brandishing her lethal limbs, each hooked and fitted with
a double saw; an angry Hornet, darting her awful sting; a sturdy
Beetle, invincible under his horny armour.These are exceptional
morsels, hardly ever known to the Epeirae.Will they be accepted, if
supplied by my stratagems?The game is seen to be perilous of
approach and the Spider turns her back upon it instead of facing it;
she trains her rope-cannon upon it.Quickly the hind-legs draw from the
spinnerets something much better than single cords.The whole
silk-battery works at one and the same time, firing a regular volley of
ribbons and sheets, which a wide movement of the legs spreads fan-wise
and flings over the entangled prisoner.Guarding against sudden starts,
the Epeira casts her armfuls of bands on the front- and hind-parts,
over the legs and over the wings, here, there and everywhere,
extravagantly.The most fiery prey is promptly mastered under this
avalanche.In vain the Mantis tries to open her saw-toothed arm-guards;
in vain the Hornet makes play with her dagger; in vain the Beetle
stiffens his legs and arches his back: a fresh wave of threads swoops
down and paralyses every effort.The ancient retiarius, when pitted against a powerful wild beast,
appeared in the arena with a rope-net folded over his left shoulder.The man, with a sudden movement of his
right arm, cast the net after the manner of the fisherman; he covered
the beast and tangled it in the meshes.A thrust of the trident gave
the quietus to the vanquished foe.The Epeira acts in like fashion, with this advantage, that she is able
to renew her armful of fetters.Should the first not suffice, a second
instantly follows and another and yet another, until the reserves of
silk become exhausted.When all movement ceases under the snowy winding-sheet, the Spider goes
up to her bound prisoner.She has a better weapon than the bestiarius'
trident: she has her poison-fangs.She gnaws at the Locust, without
undue persistence, and then withdraws, leaving the torpid patient to
pine away.These lavished, far-flung ribbons threaten to exhaust the factory; it
would be much more economical to resort to the method of the spool;
but, to turn the machine, the Spider would have to go up to it and work
it with her leg.This is too risky; and hence the continuous spray of
silk, at a safe distance.When all is used up, there is more to come.Still, the Epeira seems concerned at this excessive outlay.When
circumstances permit, she gladly returns to the mechanism of the
revolving spool.I saw her practice this abrupt change of tactics on a
big Beetle, with a smooth, plump body, which lent itself admirably to
the rotary process.After depriving the beast of all power of movement,
she went up to it and turned her corpulent victim as she would have
done with a medium-sized Moth.But with the Praying Mantis, sticking out her long legs and her
spreading wings, rotation is no longer feasible.Then, until the quarry
is thoroughly subdued, the spray of bandages goes on continuously, even
to the point of drying up the silk glands.A capture of this kind is
ruinous.It is true that, except when I interfered, I have never seen
the Spider tackle that formidable provender.Be it feeble or strong, the game is now neatly trussed, by one of the
two methods.The bound insect is bitten,
without persistency and without any wound that shows.The Spider next
retires and allows the bite to act, which it soon does.If the victim be small, a Clothes-moth, for instance, it is consumed on
the spot, at the place where it was captured.But, for a prize of some
importance, on which she hopes to feast for many an hour, sometimes for
many a day, the Spider needs a sequestered dining-room, where there is
naught to fear from the stickiness of the network.Before going to it,
she first makes her prey turn in the converse direction to that of the
original rotation.Her object is to free the nearest spokes, which
supplied pivots for the machinery.They are essential factors which it
behoves her to keep intact, if need be by sacrificing a few cross-bars.It is done; the twisted ends are put back into position.The
well-trussed game is at last removed from the web and fastened on
behind with a thread.The Spider then marches in front and the load is
trundled across the web and hoisted to the resting-floor, which is both
an inspection-post and a dining-hall.When the Spider is of a species
that shuns the light and possesses a telegraph-line, she mounts to her
daytime hiding-place along this line, with the game bumping against her
heels.While she is refreshing herself, let us enquire into the effects of the
little bite previously administered to the silk-swathed captive.Does
the Spider kill the patient with a view to avoiding unseasonable jerks,
protests so disagreeable at dinner-time?In the first place, the attack is so much veiled as to have all the
appearance of a mere kiss.Besides, it is made anywhere, at the first
spot that offers.The expert slayers employ methods of the highest
precision: they give a stab in the neck, or under the throat; they
wound the cervical nerve-centres, the seat of energy.The paralysers,
those accomplished anatomists, poison the motor nerve-centres, of which
they know the number and position.The Epeira possesses none of this
fearsome knowledge.She inserts her fangs at random, as the Bee does
her sting.She does not select one spot rather than another; she bites
indifferently at whatever comes within reach.This being so, her poison
would have to possess unparalleled virulence to produce a corpse-like
inertia no matter which the point attacked.I can scarcely believe in
instantaneous death resulting from the bite, especially in the case of
insects, with their highly-resistant organisms.Besides, is it really a corpse that the Epeira wants, she who feeds on
blood much more than on flesh?It were to her advantage to suck a live
body, wherein the flow of the liquids, set in movement by the pulsation
of the dorsal vessel, that rudimentary heart of insects, must act more
freely than in a lifeless body, with its stagnant fluids.The game
which the Spider means to suck dry might very well not be dead.I place some Locusts of different species on the webs in my menagerie,
one on this, another on that.The Spider comes rushing up, binds the
prey, nibbles at it gently and withdraws, waiting for the bite to take
effect.I then take the insect and carefully strip it of its silken
shroud.The Locust is not dead; far from it; one would even think that
he had suffered no harm.I examine the released prisoner through the
lens in vain; I can see no trace of a wound.Can he be unscathed, in spite of the sort of kiss which I saw given to
him just now?You would be ready to say so, judging by the furious way
in which he kicks in my fingers.Nevertheless, when put on the ground,
he walks awkwardly, he seems reluctant to hop.Perhaps it is a
temporary trouble, caused by his terrible excitement in the web.It
looks as though it would soon pass.I lodge my Locusts in cages, with a lettuce-leaf to console them for
their trials; but they will not be comforted.A day elapses, followed
by a second.Not one of them touches the leaf of salad; their appetite
has disappeared.Their movements become more uncertain, as though
hampered by irresistible torpor.On the second day they are dead,
everyone irrecoverably dead.The Epeira, therefore, does not incontinently kill her prey with her
delicate bite; she poisons it so as to produce a gradual weakness,
which gives the blood-sucker ample time to drain her victim, without
the least risk, before the rigor mortis stops the flow of moisture.The meal lasts quite twenty-four hours, if the joint be large; and to
the very end the butchered insect retains a remnant of life, a
favourable condition for the exhausting of the juices.Once again, we
see a skilful method of slaughter, very different from the tactics in
use among the expert paralysers or slayers.Here there is no display of
anatomical science.Unacquainted with the patient's structure, the
Spider stabs at random.The virulence of the poison does the rest.There are, however, some very few cases in which the bite is speedily
mortal.My notes speak of an Angular Epeira grappling with the largest
Dragon-fly in my district (Aeshna grandis, Lin.)I myself had entangled
in the web this head of big game, which is not often captured by the
Epeirae.The net shakes violently, seems bound to break its moorings.The Spider rushes from her leafy villa, runs boldly up to the giantess,
flings a single bundle of ropes at her and, without further
precautions, grips her with her legs, tries to subdue her and then digs
her fangs into the Dragon-fly's back.The bite is prolonged in such a
way as to astonish me.This is not the perfunctory kiss with which I am
already familiar; it is a deep, determined wound.After striking her
blow, the Spider retires to a certain distance and waits for her poison
to take effect.Laid upon my table and left alone for twenty-four hours, she makes not
the slightest movement.A prick of which my lens cannot see the marks,
so sharp-pointed are the Epeira's weapons, was enough, with a little
insistence, to kill the powerful animal.Proportionately, the
Rattlesnake, the Horned Viper, the Trigonocephalus and other ill-famed
serpents produce less paralysing effects upon their victims.And these Epeirae, so terrible to insects, I am able to handle without
any fear.If I persuaded them to bite me,
what would happen to me?We have more cause to dread
the sting of a nettle than the dagger which is fatal to Dragon-flies.The same virus acts differently upon this organism and that, is
formidable here and quite mild there.What kills the insect may easily
be harmless to us.Let us not, however, generalize too far.The
Narbonne Lycosa, that other enthusiastic insect-huntress, would make us
pay dearly if we attempted to take liberties with her.It is not uninteresting to watch the Epeira at dinner.I light upon
one, the Banded Epeira, at the moment, about three o'clock in the
afternoon, when she has captured a Locust.Planted in the centre of the
web, on her resting-floor, she attacks the venison at the joint of a
haunch.There is no movement, not even of the mouth-parts, so far as I
am able to discover.The mouth lingers, close-applied, at the point
originally bitten.There are no intermittent mouthfuls, with the
mandibles moving backwards and forwards.I
visit her for the last time at nine o'clock in the evening.Matters
stand exactly as they did: after six hours' consumption, the mouth is
still sucking at the lower end of the right haunch.The fluid contents
of the victim are transferred to the ogress's belly, I know not how.Next morning, the Spider is still at table.Naught remains of the Locust but his skin, hardly altered in shape, but
utterly drained and perforated in several places.The method,
therefore, was changed during the night.To extract the non-fluent
residue, the viscera and muscles, the stiff cuticle had to be tapped
here, there and elsewhere, after which the tattered husk, placed bodily
in the press of the mandibles, would have been chewed, re-chewed and
finally reduced to a pill, which the sated Spider throws up.This would
have been the end of the victim, had I not taken it away before the
time.Whether she wound or kill, the Epeira bites her captive somewhere or
other, no matter where.This is an excellent method on her part,
because of the variety of the game that comes her way.I see her
accepting with equal readiness whatever chance may send her:
Butterflies and Dragon-flies, Flies and Wasps, small Dung-beetles and
Locusts.If I offer her a Mantis, a Bumble-bee, an Anoxia--the
equivalent of the common Cockchafer--and other dishes probably unknown
to her race, she accepts all and any, large and small, thin-skinned and
horny-skinned, that which goes afoot and that which takes winged
flight.She is omnivorous, she preys on everything, down to her own
kind, should the occasion offer.Had she to operate according to individual structure, she would need an
anatomical dictionary; and instinct is essentially unfamiliar with
generalities: its knowledge is always confined to limited points.The
Cerceres know their Weevils and their Buprestis-beetles absolutely; the
Sphex their Grasshoppers, their Crickets and their Locusts; the Scoliae
their Cetonia- and Oryctes-grubs.(The Scolia is a Digger-wasp, like
the Cerceris and the Sphex, and feeds her larvae on the grubs of the
Cetonia, or Rose-chafer, and the Oryctes, or
Rhinoceros-beetle.--Translator's Note.)Each has her own victim and knows nothing of any of the others.The same exclusive tastes prevail among the slayers.Let us remember,
in this connection, Philanthus apivorus and, especially, the Thomisus,
the comely Spider who cuts Bees' throats.They understand the fatal
blow, either in the neck or under the chin, a thing which the Epeira
does not understand; but, just because of this talent, they are
specialists.Animals are a little like ourselves: they excel in an art only on
condition of specializing in it.The Epeira, who, being omnivorous, is
obliged to generalize, abandons scientific methods and makes up for
this by distilling a poison capable of producing torpor and even death,
no matter what the point attacked.Recognizing the large variety of game, we wonder how the Epeira manages
not to hesitate amid those many diverse forms, how, for instance, she
passes from the Locust to the Butterfly, so different in appearance.To
attribute to her as a guide an extensive zoological knowledge were
wildly in excess of what we may reasonably expect of her poor
intelligence.The thing moves, therefore it is worth catching: this
formula seems to sum up the Spider's wisdom.Of the six Garden Spiders that form the object of my observations, two
only, the Banded and the Silky Epeira, remain constantly in their webs,
even under the blinding rays of a fierce sun.The others, as a rule, do
not show themselves until nightfall.At some distance from the net they
have a rough-and-ready retreat in the brambles, an ambush made of a few
leaves held together by stretched threads.It is here that, for the
most part, they remain in the daytime, motionless and sunk in
meditation.But the shrill light that vexes them is the joy of the fields.At such
times the Locust hops more nimbly than ever, more gaily skims the
Dragon-fly.Besides, the limy web, despite the rents suffered during
the night, is still in serviceable condition.If some giddy-pate allow
himself to be caught, will the Spider, at the distance whereto she has
retired, be unable to take advantage of the windfall?The alarm is given by the vibration of the web, much more than by the
sight of the captured object.I lay upon a Banded Epeira's lime-threads a Locust that second
asphyxiated with carbon disulphide.The carcass is placed in front, or
behind, or at either side of the Spider, who sits moveless in the
centre of the net.If the test is to be applied to a species with a
daytime hiding-place amid the foliage, the dead Locust is laid on the
web, more or less near the centre, no matter how.The Epeira remains in her
motionless attitude, even when the morsel is at a short distance in
front of her.She is indifferent to the presence of the game, does not
seem to perceive it, so much so that she ends by wearing out my
patience.Then, with a long straw, which enables me to conceal myself
slightly, I set the dead insect trembling.The Banded Epeira and the Silky Epeira hasten to
the central floor; the others come down from the branch; all go to the
Locust, swathe him with tape, treat him, in short, as they would treat
a live prey captured under normal conditions.It took the shaking of
the web to decide them to attack.Perhaps the grey colour of the Locust is not sufficiently conspicuous
to attract attention by itself.Then let us try red, the brightest
colour to our retina and probably also to the Spiders'.None of the
game hunted by the Epeirae being clad in scarlet, I make a small bundle
out of red wool, a bait of the size of a Locust.As long as the parcel is stationary, the Spider
is not roused; but, the moment it trembles, stirred by my straw, she
runs up eagerly.There are silly ones who just touch the thing with their legs and,
without further enquiries, swathe it in silk after the manner of the
usual game.They even go so far as to dig their fangs into the bait,
following the rule of the preliminary poisoning.Then and then only the
mistake is recognized and the tricked Spider retires and does not come
back, unless it be long afterwards, when she flings the lumbersome
object out of the web.Like the others, these hasten to the
red-woollen lure, which my straw insidiously keeps moving; they come
from their tent among the leaves as readily as from the centre of the
web; they explore it with their palpi and their legs; but, soon
perceiving that the thing is valueless, they are careful not to spend
their silk on useless bonds.Still, the clever ones, like the silly ones, run even from a distance,
from their leafy ambush.Before recognizing their mistake, they have to hold the object between
their legs and even to nibble at it a little.At a hand's-breadth's distance, the lifeless prey,
unable to shake the web, remains unperceived.Besides, in many cases,
the hunting takes place in the dense darkness of the night, when sight,
even if it were good, would not avail.If the eyes are insufficient guides, even close at hand, how will it be
when the prey has to be spied from afar?In that case, an intelligence
apparatus for long-distance work becomes indispensable.We have no
difficulty in detecting the apparatus.Let us look attentively behind the web of any Epeira with a daytime
hiding-place: we shall see a thread that starts from the centre of the
network, ascends in a slanting line outside the plane of the web and
ends at the ambush where the Spider lurks all day.Except at the
central point, there is no connection between this thread and the rest
of the work, no interweaving with the scaffolding-threads.Free of
impediment, the line runs straight from the centre of the net to the
ambush-tent.The Angular Epeira,
settled high up in the trees, has shown me some as long as eight or
nine feet.There is no doubt that this slanting line is a foot-bridge which allows
the Spider to repair hurriedly to the web, when summoned by urgent
business, and then, when her round is finished, to return to her hut.In fact, it is the road which I see her follow, in going and coming.No; for, if the Epeira had no aim in view but a means
of rapid transit between her tent and the net, the foot-bridge would be
fastened to the upper edge of the web.The journey would be shorter and
the <DW72> less steep.Why, moreover, does this line always start in the centre of the sticky
network and nowhere else?Because that is the point where the spokes
meet and, therefore, the common centre of vibration.Anything that
moves upon the web sets it shaking.All then that is needed is a thread
issuing from this central point to convey to a distance the news of a
prey struggling in some part or other of the net.The slanting cord,
extending outside the plane of the web, is more than a foot-bridge: it
is, above all, a signalling-apparatus, a telegraph-wire.Caught in the
sticky toils, he plunges about.Forthwith, the Spider issues
impetuously from her hut, comes down the foot-bridge, makes a rush for
the Locust, wraps him up and operates on him according to rule.Soon
after, she hoists him, fastened by a line to her spinneret, and drags
him to her hiding-place, where a long banquet will be held.So far,
nothing new: things happen as usual.I leave the Spider to mind her own affairs for some days before I
interfere with her.I again propose to give her a Locust; but this time
I first cut the signalling-thread with a touch of the scissors, without
shaking any part of the edifice.Complete success: the entangled insect struggles, sets the net
quivering; the Spider, on her side, does not stir, as though heedless
of events.The idea might occur to one that, in this business, the Epeira stays
motionless in her cabin since she is prevented from hurrying down,
because the foot-bridge is broken.Let us undeceive ourselves: for one
road open to her there are a hundred, all ready to bring her to the
place where her presence is now required.The network is fastened to
the branches by a host of lines, all of them very easy to cross.Well,
the Epeira embarks upon none of them, but remains moveless and
self-absorbed.Because her telegraph, being out of order, no longer tells her of
the shaking of the web.The captured prey is too far off for her to see
it; she is all unwitting.A good hour passes, with the Locust still
kicking, the Spider impassive, myself watching.Nevertheless, in the
end, the Epeira wakes up: no longer feeling the signalling-thread,
broken by my scissors, as taut as usual under her legs, she comes to
look into the state of things.The web is reached, without the least
difficulty, by one of the lines of the framework, the first that
offers.The Locust is then perceived and forthwith enswathed, after
which the signalling-thread is remade, taking the place of the one
which I have broken.Along this road the Spider goes home, dragging her
prey behind her.My neighbour, the mighty Angular Epeira, with her telegraph-wire nine
feet long, has even better things in store for me.One morning I find
her web, which is now deserted, almost intact, a proof that the night's
hunting has not been good.With a piece of
game for a bait, I hope to bring her down from her lofty retreat.I entangle in the web a rare morsel, a Dragon-fly, who struggles
desperately and sets the whole net a-shaking.The other, up above,
leaves her lurking-place amid the cypress-foliage, strides swiftly down
along her telegraph-wire, comes to the Dragon-fly, trusses her and at
once climbs home again by the same road, with her prize dangling at her
heels by a thread.The final sacrifice will take place in the quiet of
the leafy sanctuary.A few days later I renew my experiment under the same conditions, but,
this time, I first cut the signalling-thread.In vain I select a large
Dragon-fly, a very restless prisoner; in vain I exert my patience: the
Spider does not come down all day.Her telegraph being broken, she
receives no notice of what is happening nine feet below.The entangled
morsel remains where it lies, not despised, but unknown.At nightfall
the Epeira leaves her cabin, passes over the ruins of her web, finds
the Dragon-fly and eats him on the spot, after which the net is
renewed.The Epeirae, who occupy a distant retreat by day, cannot do without a
private wire that keeps them in permanent communication with the
deserted web.All of them have one, in point of fact, but only when age
comes, age prone to rest and to long slumbers.In their youth, the
Epeirae, who are then very wide awake, know nothing of the art of
telegraphy.Besides, their web, a short-lived work whereof hardly a
trace remains on the morrow, does not allow of this kind of industry.It is no use going to the expense of a signalling-apparatus for a
ruined snare wherein nothing can now be caught.Only the old Spiders,
meditating or dozing in their green tent, are warned from afar, by
telegraph, of what takes place on the web.To save herself from keeping a close watch that would degenerate into
drudgery and to remain alive to events even when resting, with her back
turned on the net, the ambushed Spider always has her foot upon the
telegraph-wire.Of my observations on this subject, let me relate the
following, which will be sufficient for our purpose.An Angular Epeira, with a remarkably fine belly, has spun her web
between two laurustine-shrubs, covering a width of nearly a yard.The
sun beats upon the snare, which is abandoned long before dawn.The
Spider is in her day manor, a resort easily discovered by following the
telegraph-wire.It is a vaulted chamber of dead leaves, joined together
with a few bits of silk.The refuge is deep: the Spider disappears in
it entirely, all but her rounded hind-quarters, which bar the entrance
to her donjon.With her front half plunged into the back of her hut, the Epeira
certainly cannot see her web.Even if she had good sight, instead of
being purblind, her position could not possibly allow her to keep the
prey in view.Does she give up hunting during this period of bright
sunlight?One of her hind-legs is stretched outside the leafy cabin;
and the signalling-thread ends just at the tip of that leg.Whoso has
not seen the Epeira in this attitude, with her hand, so to speak, on
the telegraph-receiver, knows nothing of one of the most curious
instances of animal cleverness.Let any game appear upon the scene; and
the slumberer, forthwith aroused by means of the leg receiving the
vibrations, hastens up.A Locust whom I myself lay on the web procures
her this agreeable shock and what follows.If she is satisfied with her
bag, I am still more satisfied with what I have learnt.The different parts
of the framework, tossed and teased by the eddying air-currents, cannot
fail to transmit their vibration to the signalling-thread.Nevertheless, the Spider does not quit her hut and remains indifferent
to the commotion prevailing in the net.Her line, therefore, is
something better than a bell-rope that pulls and communicates the
impulse given: it is a telephone capable, like our own, of transmitting
infinitesimal waves of sound.Clutching her telephone-wire with a toe,
the Spider listens with her leg; she perceives the innermost
vibrations; she distinguishes between the vibration proceeding from a
prisoner and the mere shaking caused by the wind.A wasp-like garb of motley black and yellow; a slender and graceful
figure; wings not spread out flat, when resting, but folded lengthwise
in two; the abdomen a sort of chemist's retort, which swells into a
gourd and is fastened to the thorax by a long neck, first distending
into a pear, then shrinking to a thread; a leisurely and silent flight;
lonely habits.There we have a summary sketch of the Eumenes.My part
of the country possesses two species: the larger, Eumenes Amedei, Lep.,
measures nearly an inch in length; the other, Eumenes pomiformis,
Fabr., is a reduction of the first to the scale of one-half.(I include
three species promiscuously under this one name, that is to say,
Eumenes pomiformis, Fabr., E. bipunctis, Sauss., and E. dubius, Sauss.As I did not distinguish between them in my first investigations, which
date a very long time back, it is not possible for me to ascribe to
each of them its respective nest.But their habits are the same, for
which reason this confusion does not injuriously affect the order of
ideas in the present chapter.--Author's Note.)Similar in form and colouring, both possess a like talent for
architecture; and this talent is expressed in a work of the highest
perfection which charms the most untutored eye.The Eumenes follow the profession of arms, which is
unfavourable to artistic effort; they stab a prey with their sting;
they pillage and plunder.They are predatory Hymenoptera, victualling
their grubs with caterpillars.It will be interesting to compare their
habits with those of the operator on the Grey Worm.(Ammophila hirsuta,
who hunts the Grey Worm, the caterpillar of Noctua segetum, the Dart or
Turnip Moth.--Translator's Note.)Though the quarry--caterpillars in
either case--remain the same, perhaps instinct, which is liable to vary
with the species, has fresh glimpses in store for us.Besides, the
edifice built by the Eumenes in itself deserves inspection.The Hunting Wasps whose story we have described in former volumes are
wonderfully well versed in the art of wielding the lancet; they astound
us with their surgical methods, which they seem to have learnt from
some physiologist who allows nothing to escape him; but those skilful
slayers have no merit as builders of dwelling-houses.What is their
home, in point of fact?An underground passage, with a cell at the end
of it; a gallery, an excavation, a shapeless cave.It is miner's work,
navvy's work: vigorous sometimes, artistic never.They use the pick-axe
for loosening, the crowbar for shifting, the rake for extracting the
materials, but never the trowel for laying.Now in the Eumenes we see
real masons, who build their houses bit by bit with stone and mortar
and run them up in the open, either on the firm rock or on the shaky
support of a bough.Hunting alternates with architecture; the insect is
a Nimrod or a Vitruvius by turns.(Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, the Roman
architect and engineer.--Translator's Note.)And, first of all, what sites do these builders select for their homes?Should you pass some little garden-wall, facing south, in a
sun-scorched corner, look at the stones that are not covered with
plaster, look at them one by one, especially the largest; examine the
masses of boulders, at no great height from the ground, where the
fierce rays have heated them to the temperature of a Turkish bath; and,
perhaps, if you seek long enough, you will light upon the structure of
Eumenes Amedei.The insect is scarce and lives apart; a meeting is an
event upon which we must not count with too great confidence.It is an
African species and loves the heat that ripens the carob and the date.It haunts the sunniest spots and selects rocks or firm stones as a
foundation for its nest.Sometimes also, but seldom, it copies the
Chalicodoma of the Walls and builds upon an ordinary pebble.(Or
Mason-bee.--Translator's Note.)Eumenes pomiformis is much more common and is comparatively indifferent
to the nature of the foundation whereon she erects her cells.She
builds on walls, on isolated stones, on the wood of the inner surface
of half-closed shutters; or else she adopts an aerial base, the slender
twig of a shrub, the withered sprig of a plant of some sort.Less
chilly than her African cousin, she does not shun the unprotected
spaces exposed to every wind that blows.When erected on a horizontal surface, where nothing interferes with it,
the structure of Eumenes Amedei is a symmetrical cupola, a spherical
skull-cap, with, at the top, a narrow passage just wide enough for the
insect, and surmounted by a neatly funnelled neck.It suggests the
round hut of the Eskimo or of the ancient Gael, with its central
chimney.Two centimetres and a half (.97 inch.--Translator's Note.),
more or less, represent the diameter, and two centimetres the height.(.78 inch.--Translator's Note.)When the support is a perpendicular
plane, the building still retains the domed shape, but the entrance-
and exit-funnel opens at the side, upwards.The floor of this apartment
calls for no labour: it is supplied direct by the bare stone.Having chosen the site, the builder erects a circular fence about three
millimetres thick.(.118 inch.--Translator's Note.)The materials
consist of mortar and small stones.The insect selects its stone-quarry
in some well-trodden path, on some neighbouring road, at the driest,
hardest spots.With its mandibles, it scrapes together a small quantity
of dust and saturates it with saliva until the whole becomes a regular
hydraulic mortar which soon sets and is no longer susceptible to water.The Mason-bees have shown us a similar exploitation of the beaten paths
and of the road-mender's macadam.All these open-air builders, all
these erectors of monuments exposed to wind and weather require an
exceedingly dry stone-dust; otherwise the material, already moistened
with water, would not properly absorb the liquid that is to give it
cohesion; and the edifice would soon be wrecked by the rains.They
possess the sense of discrimination of the plasterer, who rejects
plaster injured by damp.We shall see presently how the insects that
build under shelter avoid this laborious macadam-scraping and give the
preference to fresh earth already reduced to a paste by its own
dampness.When common lime answers our purpose, we do not trouble about
Roman cement.Now Eumenes Amedei requires a first-class cement, even
better than that of the Chalicodoma of the Walls, for the work, when
finished, does not receive the thick covering wherewith the Mason-bee
protects her cluster of cells.And therefore the cupola-builder, as
often as she can, uses the highway as her stone-pit.These are bits of gravel of an
almost unvarying size--that of a peppercorn--but of a shape and kind
differing greatly, according to the places worked.Some are
sharp-cornered, with facets determined by chance fractures; some are
round, polished by friction under water.Some are of limestone, others
of silicic matter.The favourite stones, when the neighbourhood of the
nest permits, are little nodules of quartz, smooth and semitransparent.The insect weighs them, so to say,
measures them with the compass of its mandibles and does not accept
them until after recognizing in them the requisite qualities of size
and hardness.A circular fence, we were saying, is begun on the bare rock.Before the
mortar sets, which does not take long, the mason sticks a few stones
into the soft mass, as the work advances.She dabs them half-way into
the cement, so as to leave them jutting out to a large extent, without
penetrating to the inside, where the wall must remain smooth for the
sake of the larva's comfort.If necessary, a little plaster is added,
to tone down the inner protuberances.The solidly embedded stonework
alternates with the pure mortarwork, of which each fresh course
receives its facing of tiny encrusted pebbles.As the edifice is
raised, the builder <DW72>s the construction a little towards the centre
and fashions the curve which will give the spherical shape.We employ
arched centrings to support the masonry of a dome while building: the
Eumenes, more daring than we, erects her cupola without any
scaffolding.A round orifice is contrived at the summit; and, on this orifice, rises
a funnelled mouthpiece built of pure cement.It might be the graceful
neck of some Etruscan vase.When the cell is victualled and the egg
laid, this mouthpiece is closed with a cement plug; and in this plug is
set a little pebble, one alone, no more: the ritual never varies.This
work of rustic architecture has naught to fear from the inclemency of
the weather; it does not yield to the pressure of the fingers; it
resists the knife that attempts to remove it without breaking it.Its
nipple shape and the bits of gravel wherewith it bristles all over the
outside remind one of certain cromlechs of olden time, of certain
tumuli whose domes are strewn with Cyclopean stones.Such is the appearance of the edifice when the cell stands alone; but
the Hymenopteron nearly always fixes other domes against her first, to
the number of five, six, or more.This shortens the labour by allowing
her to use the same partition for two adjoining rooms.The original
elegant symmetry is lost and the whole now forms a cluster which, at
first sight, appears to be merely a clod of dry mud, sprinkled with
tiny pebbles.But let us examine the shapeless mass more closely and we
shall perceive the number of chambers composing the habitation with the
funnelled mouths, each quite distinct and each furnished with its
gravel stopper set in the cement.The Chalicodoma of the Walls employs the same building methods as
Eumenes Amedei: in the courses of cement she fixes, on the outside,
small stones of minor bulk.Her work begins by being a turret of rustic
art, not without a certain prettiness; then, when the cells are placed
side by side, the whole construction degenerates into a lump governed
apparently by no architectural rule.Moreover, the Mason-bee covers her
mass of cells with a thick layer of cement, which conceals the original
rockwork edifice.The Eumenes does not resort to this general coating:
her building is too strong to need it; she leaves the pebbly facings
uncovered, as well as the entrances to the cells.The two sorts of
nests, although constructed of similar materials, are therefore easily
distinguished.The Eumenes' cupola is the work of an artist; and the artist would be
sorry to cover his masterpiece with whitewash.I crave forgiveness for
a suggestion which I advance with all the reserve befitting so delicate
a subject.Would it not be possible for the cromlech-builder to take a
pride in her work, to look upon it with some affection and to feel
gratified by this evidence of her cleverness?Might there not be an
insect science of aesthetics?I seem at least to catch a glimpse, in
the Eumenes, of a propensity to beautify her work.The nest must be,
before all, a solid habitation, an inviolable stronghold; but, should
ornament intervene without jeopardizing the power of resistance, will
the worker remain indifferent to it?The orifice at the top, if left as a mere
hole, would suit the purpose quite as well as an elaborate door: the
insect would lose nothing in regard to facilities for coming and going
and would gain by shortening the labour.Yet we find, on the contrary,
the mouth of an amphora, gracefully curved, worthy of a potter's wheel.A choice cement and careful work are necessary for the confection of
its slender, funnelled shaft.Why this nice finish, if the builder be
wholly absorbed in the solidity of her work?Here is another detail: among the bits of gravel employed for the outer
covering of the cupola, grains of quartz predominate.They are polished
and translucent; they glitter slightly and please the eye.Why are
these little pebbles preferred to chips of lime-stone, when both
materials are found in equal abundance around the nest?A yet more remarkable feature: we find pretty often, encrusted on the
dome, a few tiny, empty snail-shells, bleached by the sun.The species
usually selected by the Eumenes is one of the smaller Helices--Helix
strigata--frequent on our parched <DW72>s.I have seen nests where this
Helix took the place of pebbles almost entirely.They were like boxes
made of shells, the work of a patient hand.Certain Australian birds, notably the
Bower-birds, build themselves covered walks, or playhouses, with
interwoven twigs, and decorate the two entrances to the portico by
strewing the threshold with anything that they can find in the shape of
glittering, polished, or bright- objects.Every door-sill is a
cabinet of curiosities where the collector gathers smooth pebbles,
variegated shells, empty snail-shells, parrot's feathers, bones that
have come to look like sticks of ivory.The odds and ends mislaid by
man find a home in the bird's museum, where we see pipe-stems, metal
buttons, strips of cotton stuff and stone axe-heads.The collection at either entrance to the bower is large enough to fill
half a bushel.As these objects are of no use to the bird, its only
motive for accumulating them must be an art-lover's hobby.Our common
Magpie has similar tastes: any shiny thing that he comes upon he picks
up, hides and hoards.Well, the Eumenes, who shares this passion for bright pebbles and empty
snail-shells, is the Bower-bird of the insect world; but she is a more
practical collector, knows how to combine the useful and the ornamental
and employs her finds in the construction of her nest, which is both a
fortress and a museum.When she finds nodules of translucent quartz,
she rejects everything else: the building will be all the prettier for
them.When she comes across a little white shell, she hastens to
beautify her dome with it; should fortune smile and empty snail-shells
abound, she encrusts the whole fabric with them, until it becomes the
supreme expression of her artistic taste.The nest of Eumenes pomiformis is the size of an average cherry and
constructed of pure mortar, without the least outward pebblework.Its
shape is exactly similar to that which we have just described.When
built upon a horizontal base of sufficient extent, it is a dome with a
central neck, funnelled like the mouth of an urn.But when the
foundation is reduced to a mere point, as on the twig of a shrub, the
nest becomes a spherical capsule, always, of course, surmounted by a
neck.It is then a miniature specimen of exotic pottery, a paunchy
alcarraza.Its thickens is very slight, less than that of a sheet of
paper; it crushes under the least effort of the fingers.It displays wrinkles and seams, due to the different
courses of mortar, or else knotty protuberances distributed almost
concentrically.Both Hymenoptera accumulate caterpillars in their coffers, whether
domes or jars.Let us give an abstract of the bill of fare.These
documents, for all their dryness, possess a value; they will enable
whoso cares to interest himself in the Eumenes to perceive to what
extent instinct varies the diet, according to the place and season.The
food is plentiful, but lacks variety.It consists of tiny caterpillars,
by which I mean the grubs of small Butterflies.We learn this from the
structure, for we observe in the prey selected by either Hymenopteran
the usual caterpillar organism.The body is composed of twelve
segments, not including the head.The first three have true legs, the
next two are legless, then come two segments with prolegs, two legless
segments and, lastly, a terminal segment with prolegs.It is exactly
the same structure which we saw in the Ammophila's Grey Worm.My old notes give the following description of the caterpillars found
in the nest of Eumenes Amedei: "a pale green or, less often, a
yellowish body, covered with short white hairs; head wider than the
front segment, dead-black and also bristling with hairs.Length: 16 to
18 millimetres (.63 to.7 inch.--Translator's Note.); width: about 3
millimetres."(.12 inch.--Translator's Note.)A quarter of a century
and more has elapsed since I jotted down this descriptive sketch; and
to-day, at Serignan, I find in the Eumenes' larder the same game which
I noticed long ago at Carpentras.Time and distance have not altered
the nature of the provisions.The number of morsels served for the meal of each larva interests us
more than the quality.In the cells of Eumenes Amedei, I find sometimes
five caterpillars and sometimes ten, which means a difference of a
hundred per cent in the quantity of the food, for the morsels are of
exactly the same size in both cases.Why this unequal supply, which
gives a double portion to one larva and a single portion to another?The diners have the same appetite: what one nurseling demands a second
must demand, unless we have here a different menu, according to the
sexes.In the perfect stage the males are smaller than the females, are
hardly half as much in weight or volume.The amount of victuals,
therefore, required to bring them to their final development may be
reduced by one-half.In that case, the well-stocked cells belong to
females; the others, more meagrely supplied, belong to males.But the egg is laid when the provisions are stored; and this egg has a
determined sex, though the most minute examination is not able to
discover the differences which will decide the hatching of a female or
a male.We are therefore needs driven to this strange conclusion: the
mother knows beforehand the sex of the egg which she is about to lay;
and this knowledge allows her to fill the larder according to the
appetite of the future grub.What a strange world, so wholly different
from ours!We fall back upon a special sense to explain the Ammophila's
hunting; what can we fall back upon to account for this intuition of
the future?Can the theory of chances play a part in the hazy problem?If nothing is logically arranged with a foreseen object, how is this
clear vision of the invisible acquired?The capsules of Eumenes pomiformis are literally crammed with game.It
is true that the morsels are very small.My notes speak of fourteen
green caterpillars in one cell and sixteen in a second cell.I have no
other information about the integral diet of this Wasp, whom I have
neglected somewhat, preferring to study her cousin, the builder of
rockwork domes.As the two sexes differ in size, although to a lesser
degree than in the case of Eumenes Amedei, I am inclined to think that
those two well-filled cells belonged to females and that the males'
cells must have a less sumptuous table.Not having seen for myself, I
am content to set down this mere suspicion.What I have seen and often seen is the pebbly nest, with the larva
inside and the provisions partly consumed.To continue the rearing at
home and follow my charge's progress from day to day was a business
which I could not resist; besides, as far as I was able to see, it was
easily managed.I had had some practice in this foster-father's trade;
my association with the Bembex, the Ammophila, the Sphex (three species
of Digger-wasps.--Translator's Note.)and many others had turned me
into a passable insect-rearer.I was no novice in the art of dividing
an old pen-box into compartments in which I laid a bed of sand and, on
this bed, the larva and her provisions delicately removed from the
maternal cell.Success was almost certain at each attempt: I used to
watch the larvae at their meals, I saw my nurselings grow up and spin
their cocoons.Relying upon the experience thus gained, I reckoned upon
success in raising my Eumenes.The results, however, in no way answered to my expectations.All my
endeavours failed; and the larva allowed itself to die a piteous death
without touching its provisions.I ascribed my reverse to this, that and the other cause: perhaps I had
injured the frail grub when demolishing the fortress; a splinter of
masonry had bruised it when I forced open the hard dome with my knife;
a too sudden exposure to the sun had surprised it when I withdrew it
from the darkness of its cell; the open air might have dried up its
moisture.I did the best I could to remedy all these probable reasons
of failure.I went to work with every possible caution in breaking open
the home; I cast the shadow of my body over the nest, to save the grub
from sunstroke; I at once transferred larva and provisions into a glass
tube and placed this tube in a box which I carried in my hand, to
minimize the jolting on the journey.Nothing was of avail: the larva,
when taken from its dwelling, always allowed itself to pine away.For a long time I persisted in explaining my want of success by the
difficulties attending the removal.Eumenes Amedei's cell is a strong
casket which cannot be forced without sustaining a shock; and the
demolition of a work of this kind entails such varied accidents that we
are always liable to think that the worm has been bruised by the
wreckage.As for carrying home the nest intact on its support, with a
view to opening it with greater care than is permitted by a
rough-and-ready operation in the fields, that is out of the question:
the nest nearly always stands on an immovable rock or on some big stone
forming part of a wall.If I failed in my attempts at rearing, it was
because the larva had suffered when I was breaking up her house.The
reason seemed a good one; and I let it go at that.In the end, another idea occurred to me and made me doubt whether my
rebuffs were always due to clumsy accidents.The Eumenes' cells are
crammed with game: there are ten caterpillars in the cell of Eumenes
Amedei and fifteen in that of Eumenes pomiformis.These caterpillars,
stabbed no doubt, but in a manner unknown to me, are not entirely
motionless.The mandibles seize upon what is presented to them, the
body buckles and unbuckles, the hinder half lashes out briskly when
stirred with the point of a needle.At what spot is the egg laid amid
that swarming mass, where thirty mandibles can make a hole in it, where
a hundred and twenty pairs of legs can tear it?When the victuals
consist of a single head of game, these perils do not exist; and the
egg is laid on the victim not at hazard, but upon a judiciously chosen
spot.Thus, for instance, Ammophila hirsuta fixes hers, by one end,
cross-wise, on the Grey Worm, on the side of the first prolegged
segment.The eggs hang over the caterpillar's back, away from the legs,
whose proximity might be dangerous.The worm, moreover, stung in the
greater number of its nerve-centres, lies on one side, motionless and
incapable of bodily contortions or said an jerks of its hinder
segments.If the mandibles try to snap, if the legs give a kick or two,
they find nothing in front of them: the Ammophila's egg is at the
opposite side.The tiny grub is thus able, as soon as it hatches, to
dig into the giant's belly in full security.How different are the conditions in the Eumenes' cell.The caterpillars
are imperfectly paralysed, perhaps because they have received but a
single stab; they toss about when touched with a pin; they are bound to
wriggle when bitten by the larva.If the egg is laid on one of them,
the first morsel will, I admit, be consumed without danger, on
condition that the point of attack be wisely chosen; but there remain
others which are not deprived of every means of defence.Let a movement
take place in the mass; and the egg, shifted from the upper layer, will
tumble into a pitfall of legs and mandibles.The least thing is enough
to jeopardize its existence; and this least thing has every chance of
being brought about in the disordered heap of caterpillars.The egg, a
tiny cylinder, transparent as crystal, is extremely delicate: a touch
withers it, the least pressure crushes it.No, its place is not in the mass of provisions, for the caterpillars, I
repeat, are not sufficiently harmless.Their paralysis is incomplete,
as is proved by their contortions when I irritate them and shown, on
the other hand, by a very important fact.I have sometimes taken from
Eumenes Amedei's cell a few heads of game half transformed into
chrysalids.It is evident that the transformation was effected in the
cell itself and, therefore, after the operation which the Wasp had
performed upon them.I cannot say
precisely, never having seen the huntress at work.The sting most
certainly has played its part; but where?What we are able to declare is that the torpor is not
very deep, inasmuch as the patient sometimes retains enough vitality to
shed its skin and become a chrysalid.Everything thus tends to make us
ask by what stratagem the egg is shielded from danger.This stratagem I longed to discover; I would not be put off by the
scarcity of nests, by the irksomeness of the searches, by the risk of
sunstroke, by the time taken up, by the vain breaking open of
unsuitable cells; I meant to see and I saw.Here is my method: with the
point of a knife and a pair of nippers, I make a side opening, a
window, beneath the dome of Eumenes Amedei and Eumenes pomiformis.I
work with the greatest care, so as not to injure the recluse.Formerly
I attacked the cupola from the top, now I attack it from the side.I
stop when the breach is large enough to allow me to see the state of
things within.I pause to give the reader time to
reflect and to think out for himself a means of safety that will
protect the egg and afterwards the grub in the perilous conditions
which I have set forth.Seek, think and contrive, such of you as have
inventive minds.The egg is not laid upon the provisions; it is hung from the top of the
cupola by a thread which vies with that of a Spider's web for
slenderness.The dainty cylinder quivers and swings to and fro at the
least breath; it reminds me of the famous pendulum suspended from the
dome of the Pantheon to prove the rotation of the earth.The victuals
are heaped up underneath.In order to witness it, we must
open a window in cell upon cell until fortune deigns to smile upon us.The larva is hatched and already fairly large.Like the egg, it hangs
perpendicularly, by the rear, from the ceiling; but the suspensory cord
has gained considerably in length and consists of the original thread
eked out by a sort of ribbon.The grub is at dinner: head downwards, it
is digging into the limp belly of one of the caterpillars.I touch up
the game that is still intact with a straw.The grub forthwith retires from the fray.Marvel is
added to marvels: what I took for a flat cord, for a ribbon, at the
lower end of the suspensory thread, is a sheath, a scabbard, a sort of
ascending gallery wherein the larva crawls backwards and makes its way
up.The cast shell of the egg, retaining its cylindrical form and
perhaps lengthened by a special operation on the part of the new-born
grub, forms this safety-channel.At the least sign of danger in the
heap of caterpillars, the larva retreats into its sheath and climbs
back to the ceiling, where the swarming rabble cannot reach it.When
peace is restored, it slides down its case and returns to table, with
its head over the viands and its rear upturned and ready to withdraw in
case of need.Strength has come; the larva is brawny enough not
to dread the movements of the caterpillars' bodies.Besides, the
caterpillars, mortified by fasting and weakened by a prolonged torpor,
become more and more incapable of defence.The perils of the tender
babe are succeeded by the security of the lusty stripling; and the
grub, henceforth scorning its sheathed lift, lets itself drop upon the
game that remains.That is what I saw in the nests of both species of the Eumenes and that
is what I showed to friends who were even more surprised than I by
these ingenious tactics.The egg hanging from the ceiling, at a
distance from the provisions, has naught to fear from the caterpillars,
which flounder about below.The new-hatched larva, whose suspensory
cord is lengthened by the sheath of the egg, reaches the game and takes
a first cautious bite at it.If there be danger, it climbs back to the
ceiling by retreating inside the scabbard.This explains the failure of
my earlier attempts.Not knowing of the safety-thread, so slender and
so easily broken, I gathered at one time the egg, at another the young
larva, after my inroads at the top had caused them to fall into the
middle of the live victuals.Neither of them was able to thrive when
brought into direct contact with the dangerous game.If any one of my readers, to whom I appealed just now, has thought out
something better than the Eumenes' invention, I beg that he will let me
know: there is a curious parallel to be drawn between the inspirations
of reason and the inspirations of instinct.February has its sunny days, heralding spring, to which rude winter
will reluctantly yield place.In snug corners, among the rocks, the
great spurge of our district, the characias of the Greeks, the jusclo
of the Provencals, begins to lift its drooping inflorescence and
discreetly opens a few sombre flowers.Here the first midges of the
year will come to slake their thirst.By the time that the tip of the
stalks reaches the perpendicular, the worst of the cold weather will be
over.Another eager one, the almond-tree, risking the loss of its fruit,
hastens to echo these preludes to the festival of the sun, preludes
which are too often treacherous.A few days of soft skies and it
becomes a glorious dome of white flowers, each twinkling with a roseate
eye.The country, which still lacks green, seems dotted everywhere with
white-satin pavilions.'Twould be a callous heart indeed that could
resist the magic of this awakening.The insect nation is represented at these rites by a few of its more
zealous members.There is first of all the Honey-bee, the sworn enemy
of strikes, who profits by the least lull of winter to find out if some
rosemary or other is not beginning to open somewhere near the hive.The
droning of the busy swarms fills the flowery vault, while a snow of
petals falls softly to the foot of the tree.Together with the population of harvesters there mingles another, less
numerous, of mere drinkers, whose nesting-time has not yet begun.This
is the colony of the Osmiae, those exceedingly pretty solitary bees,
with their copper-<DW52> skin and bright-red fleece.Two species have
come hurrying up to take part in the joys of the almond-tree: first,
the Horned Osmia, clad in black velvet on the head and breast, with red
velvet on the abdomen; and, a little later, the Three-horned Osmia,
whose livery must be red and red only.These are the first delegates
despatched by the pollen-gleaners to ascertain the state of the season
and attend the festival of the early blooms.'Tis but a moment since they burst their cocoon, the winter abode: they
have left their retreats in the crevices of the old walls; should the
north wind blow and set the almond-tree shivering, they will hasten to
return to them.Hail to you, O my dear Osmiae, who yearly, from the far
end of the harmas, opposite snow-capped Ventoux (A mountain in the
Provencal Alps, near Carpentras and Serignan 6,271 feet.--Translator's
Note.), bring me the first tidings of the awakening of the insect
world!I am one of your friends; let us talk about you a little.Most of the Osmiae of my region do not themselves prepare the dwelling
destined for the laying.They want ready-made lodgings, such as the old
cells and old galleries of Anthophorae and Chalicodomae.If these
favourite haunts are lacking, then a hiding-place in the wall, a round
hole in some bit of wood, the tube of a reed, the spiral of a dead
Snail under a heap of stones are adopted, according to the tastes of
the several species.The retreat selected is divided into chambers by
partition-walls, after which the entrance to the dwelling receives a
massive seal.That is the sum-total of the building done.For this plasterer's rather than mason's work, the Horned and the
Three-horned Osmia employ soft earth.This material is a sort of dried
mud, which turns to pap on the addition of a drop of water.The two
Osmiae limit themselves to gathering natural soaked earth, mud in
short, which they allow to dry without any special preparation on their
part; and so they need deep and well-sheltered retreats, into which the
rain cannot penetrate, or the work would fall to pieces.Latreille's Osmia uses different materials for her partitions and her
doors.She chews the leaves of some mucilaginous plant, some mallow
perhaps, and then prepares a sort of green putty with which she builds
her partitions and finally closes the entrance to the dwelling.When
she settles in the spacious cells of the Masked Anthophora (Anthophora
personata, Illig.), the entrance to the gallery, which is wide enough
to admit a man's finger, is closed with a voluminous plug of this
vegetable paste.On the earthy banks, hardened by the sun, the home is
then betrayed by the gaudy colour of the lid.It is as though the
authorities had closed the door and affixed to it their great seals of
green wax.So far then as their building-materials are concerned, the Osmiae whom
I have been able to observe are divided into two classes: one building
compartments with mud, the other with a green-tinted vegetable putty.To the latter belongs Latreille's Osmia.The first section includes the
Horned Osmia and the Three-horned Osmia, both so remarkable for the
horny tubercles on their faces.The great reed of the south, Arundo donax, is often used, in the
country, for making rough garden-shelters against the mistral or just
for fences.These reeds, the ends of which are chopped off to make them
all the same length, are planted perpendicularly in the earth.I have
often explored them in the hope of finding Osmia-nests.The partitions
and the closing-plug of the Horned and of the Three-horned Osmia are
made, as we have seen, of a sort of mud which water instantly reduces
to pap.With the upright position of the reeds, the stopper of the
opening would receive the rain and would become diluted; the ceilings
of the storeys would fall in and the family would perish by drowning.Therefore the Osmia, who knew of these drawbacks before I did, refuses
the reeds when they are placed perpendicularly.The same reed is used for a second purpose.We make canisses of it,
that is to say, hurdles, which, in spring, serve for the rearing of
Silkworms and, in autumn, for the drying of figs.At the end of April
and during May, which is the time when the Osmiae work, the canisses
are indoors, in the Silkworm nurseries, where the Bee cannot take
possession of them; in autumn, they are outside, exposing their layers
of figs and peeled peaches to the sun; but by that time the Osmiae have
long disappeared.If, however, during the spring, an old, disused
hurdle is left out of doors, in a horizontal position, the Three-horned
Osmia often takes possession of it and makes use of the two ends, where
the reeds lie truncated and open.There are other quarters that suit the Three-horned Osmia, who is not
particular, it seems to me, and will make shift with any hiding-place,
so long as it have the requisite conditions of diameter, solidity,
sanitation and kindly darkness.The most original dwellings that I know
her to occupy are disused Snail-shells, especially the house of the
Common Snail (Helix aspersa).Let us go to the <DW72> of the hills thick
with olive-trees and inspect the little supporting-walls which are
built of dry stones and face the south.In the crevices of this
insecure masonry we shall reap a harvest of old Snail-shells, plugged
with earth right up to the orifice.The family of the Three-horned
Osmia is settled in the spiral of those shells, which is subdivided
into chambers by mud partitions.The Three-pronged Osmia (O. Tridentata, Duf.alone creates a
home of her own, digging herself a channel with her mandibles in dry
bramble and sometimes in danewort.She wants a dark retreat, hidden from the eye.I would like, nevertheless, to watch her in the privacy of her home and
to witness her work with the same facility as if she were nest-building
in the open air.Perhaps there are some interesting characteristics to
be picked up in the depths of her retreats.It remains to be seen
whether my wish can be realized.When studying the insect's mental capacity, especially its very
retentive memory for places, I was led to ask myself whether it would
not be possible to make a suitably-chosen Bee build in any place that I
wished, even in my study.And I wanted, for an experiment of this sort,
not an individual but a numerous colony.My preference lent towards the
Three-horned Osmia, who is very plentiful in my neighbourhood, where,
together with Latreille's Osmia, she frequents in particular the
monstrous nests of the Chalicodoma of the Sheds.I therefore thought
out a scheme for making the Three-horned Osmia accept my study as her
settlement and build her nest in glass tubes, through which I could
easily watch the progress.To these crystal galleries, which might well
inspire a certain distrust, were to be added more natural retreats:
reeds of every length and thickness and disused Chalicodoma-nests taken
from among the biggest and the smallest.I admit it, while mentioning that perhaps none ever succeeded so well
with me.All I ask is that the birth of my
insects, that is to say, their first seeing the light, their emerging
from the cocoon, should take place on the spot where I propose to make
them settle.Here there must be retreats of no matter what nature, but
of a shape similar to that in which the Osmia delights.The first
impressions of sight, which are the most long-lived of any, shall bring
back my insects to the place of their birth.And not only will the
Osmiae return, through the always open windows, but they will also
nidify on the natal spot, if they find something like the necessary
conditions.And so, all through the winter, I collect Osmia-cocoons picked up in
the nests of the Mason-bee of the Sheds; I go to Carpentras to glean a
more plentiful supply in the nests of the Anthophora.I spread out my
stock in a large open box on a table which receives a bright diffused
light but not the direct rays of the sun.The table stands between two
windows facing south and overlooking the garden.When the moment of
hatching comes, those two windows will always remain open to give the
swarm entire liberty to go in and out as it pleases.The glass tubes
and reed-stumps are laid here and there, in fine disorder, close to the
heaps of cocoons and all in a horizontal position, for the Osmia will
have nothing to do with upright reeds.Although such a precaution is
not indispensable, I take care to place some cocoons in each cylinder.The hatching of some of the Osmiae will therefore take place under
cover of the galleries destined to be the building-yard later; and the
site will be all the more deeply impressed on their memory.When I have
made these comprehensive arrangements, there is nothing more to be
done; and I wait patiently for the building-season to open.My Osmiae leave their cocoons in the second half of April.Under the
immediate rays of the sun, in well-sheltered nooks, the hatching would
occur a month earlier, as we can see from the mixed population of the
snowy almond-tree.The constant shade in my study has delayed the
awakening, without, however, making any change in the nesting-period,
which synchronizes with the flowering of the thyme.We now have, around
my working-table, my books, my jars and my various appliances, a
buzzing crowd that goes in and out of the windows at every moment.I
enjoin the household henceforth not to touch a thing in the insects'
laboratory, to do no more sweeping, no more dusting.They might disturb
a swarm and make it think that my hospitality was not to be trusted.During four or five weeks I witness the work of a number of Osmiae
which is much too large to allow my watching their individual
operations.I content myself with a few, whom I mark with
different- spots to distinguish them; and I take no notice of
the others, whose finished work will have my attention later.If the sun is bright, they flutter
around the heap of tubes as if to take careful note of the locality;
blows are exchanged and the rival swains indulge in mild skirmishing on
the floor, then shake the dust off their wings.They fly assiduously
from tube to tube, placing their heads in the orifices to see if some
female will at last make up her mind to emerge.She is covered with dust and has the
disordered toilet that is inseparable from the hard work of the
deliverance.A lover has seen her, so has a second, likewise a third.The lady responds to their advances by clashing
her mandibles, which open and shut rapidly, several times in
succession.The suitors forthwith fall back; and they also, no doubt to
keep up their dignity, execute savage mandibular grimaces.Then the
beauty retires into the arbour and her wooers resume their places on
the threshold.A fresh appearance of the female, who repeats the play
with her jaws; a fresh retreat of the males, who do the best they can
to flourish their own pincers.The Osmiae have a strange way of
declaring their passion: with that fearsome gnashing of their
mandibles, the lovers look as though they meant to devour each other.It suggests the thumps affected by our yokels in their moments of
gallantry.The females, who grow more numerous
from day to day, inspect the premises; they buzz outside the glass
galleries and the reed dwellings; they go in, stay for a while, come
out, go in again and then fly away briskly into the garden.They
return, first one, then another.They halt outside, in the sun, or on
the shutters fastened back against the wall; they hover in the
window-recess, come inside, go to the reeds and give a glance at them,
only to set off again and to return soon after.Thus do they learn to
know their home, thus do they fix their birthplace in their memory.The
village of our childhood is always a cherished spot, never to be
effaced from our recollection.The Osmia's life endures for a month;
and she acquires a lasting remembrance of her hamlet in a couple of
days.'Twas there that she was born; 'twas there that she loved; 'tis
there that she will return.Dulces reminiscitur Argos.(Now falling by another's wound, his eyes
  He casts to heaven, on Argos thinks and dies.--"Aeneid" Book 10, Dryden's translation.)The work of construction begins; and
my expectations are fulfilled far beyond my wishes.The Osmiae build
nests in all the retreats which I have placed at their disposal.And
now, O my Osmiae, I leave you a free field!The work begins with a thorough spring-cleaning of the home.Remnants
of cocoons, dirt consisting of spoilt honey, bits of plaster from
broken partitions, remains of dried Mollusc at the bottom of a shell:
these and much other insanitary refuse must first of all disappear.Violently the Osmia tugs at the offending object and tears it out; and
then off she goes in a desperate hurry, to dispose of it far away from
the study.They are all alike, these ardent sweepers: in their
excessive zeal, they fear lest they should block up the speck of dust
which they might drop in front of the new house.The glass tubes, which
I myself have rinsed under the tap, are not exempt from a scrupulous
cleaning.The Osmia dusts them, brushes them thoroughly with her tarsi
and then sweeps them out backwards.It makes no difference: as a conscientious housewife, she gives the
place a touch of the broom nevertheless.Now for the provisions and the partition-walls.Here the order of the
work changes according to the diameter of the cylinder.My glass tubes
vary greatly in dimensions.The largest have an inner width of a dozen
millimetres (Nearly half an inch.--Translator's Note.); the narrowest
measure six or seven.(About a quarter of an inch.--Translator's Note.)In the latter, if the bottom suit her, the Osmia sets to work bringing
pollen and honey.If the bottom do not suit her, if the sorghum-pith
plug with which I have closed the rear-end of the tube be too irregular
and badly-joined, the Bee coats it with a little mortar.When this
small repair is made, the harvesting begins.In the wider tubes, the work proceeds quite differently.At the moment
when the Osmia disgorges her honey and especially at the moment when,
with her hind-tarsi, she rubs the pollen-dust from her ventral brush,
she needs a narrow aperture, just big enough to allow of her passage.I
imagine that in a straitened gallery the rubbing of her whole body
against the sides gives the harvester a support for her brushing-work.In a spacious cylinder this support fails her; and the Osmia starts
with creating one for herself, which she does by narrowing the channel.Whether it be to facilitate the storing of the victuals or for any
other reason, the fact remains that the Osmia housed in a wide tube
begins with the partitioning.Her division is made by a dab of clay placed at right angles to the
axis of the cylinder, at a distance from the bottom determined by the
ordinary length of a cell.The wad is not a complete round; it is more
crescent-shaped, leaving a circular space between it and one side of
the tube.Fresh layers are swiftly added to the dab of clay; and soon
the tube is divided by a partition which has a circular opening at the
side of it, a sort of dog-hole through which the Osmia will proceed to
knead the Bee-bread.When the victualling is finished and the egg laid
upon the heap, the whole is closed and the filled-up partition becomes
the bottom of the next cell.Then the same method is repeated, that is
to say, in front of the just completed ceiling a second partition is
built, again with a side-passage, which is stouter, owing to its
distance from the centre, and better able to withstand the numerous
comings and goings of the housewife than a central orifice, deprived of
the direct support of the wall, could hope to be.When this partition
is ready, the provisioning of the second cell is effected; and so on
until the wide cylinder is completely stocked.The building of this preliminary party-wall, with a narrow, round
dog-hole, for a chamber to which the victuals will not be brought until
later is not restricted to the Three-horned Osmia; it is also
frequently found in the case of the Horned Osmia and of Latreille's
Osmia.Nothing could be prettier than the work of the last-named, who
goes to the plants for her material and fashions a delicate sheet in
which she cuts a graceful arch.The Chinaman partitions his house with
paper screens; Latreille's Osmia divides hers with disks of thin green
cardboard perforated with a serving-hatch which remains until the room
is completely furnished.When we have no glass houses at our disposal,
we can see these little architectural refinements in the reeds of the
hurdles, if we open them at the right season.By splitting the bramble-stumps in the course of July, we perceive also
that the Three-pronged Osmia notwithstanding her narrow gallery,
follows the same practice as Latreille's Osmia, with a difference.She
does not build a party-wall, which the diameter of the cylinder would
not permit; she confines herself to putting up a frail circular pad of
green putty, as though to limit, before any attempt at harvesting, the
space to be occupied by the Bee-bread, whose depth could not be
calculated afterwards if the insect did not first mark out its
confines.If, in order to see the Osmia's nest as a whole, we split a reed
lengthwise, taking care not to disturb its contents; or, better still,
if we select for examination the string of cells built in a glass tube,
we are forthwith struck by one detail, namely, the uneven distances
between the partitions, which are placed almost at right angles to the
axis of the cylinder.It is these distances which fix the size of the
chambers, which, with a similar base, have different heights and
consequently unequal holding-capacities.The bottom partitions, the
oldest, are farther apart; those of the front part, near the orifice,
are closer together.Moreover, the provisions are plentiful in the
loftier cells, whereas they are niggardly and reduced to one-half or
even one-third in the cells of lesser height.Let me say at once that
the large cells are destined for the females and the small ones for the
males.DISTRIBUTION OF THE SEXES.Does the insect which stores up provisions proportionate to the needs
of the egg which it is about to lay know beforehand the sex of that
egg?What we have to do is to
turn this suspicion into a certainty demonstrated by experiment.And
first let us find out how the sexes are arranged.It is not possible to ascertain the chronological order of a laying,
except by going to suitably-chosen species.Fortunately there are a few
species in which we do not find this difficulty: these are the Bees who
keep to one gallery and build their cells in storeys.Among the number
are the different inhabitants of the bramble-stumps, notably the
Three-pronged Osmiae, who form an excellent subject for observation,
partly because they are of imposing size--bigger than any other
bramble-dwellers in my neighbourhood--partly because they are so
plentiful.Let us briefly recall the Osmia's habits.Amid the tangle of a hedge, a
bramble-stalk is selected, still standing, but a mere withered stump.In this the insect digs a more or less deep tunnel, an easy piece of
work owing to the abundance of soft pith.Provisions are heaped up
right at the bottom of the tunnel and an egg is laid on the surface of
the food: that is the first-born of the family.At a height of some
twelve millimetres (About half an inch.--Translator's Note.This gives a second storey, which in its turn
receives provisions and an egg, the second in order of primogeniture.And so it goes on, storey by storey, until the cylinder is full.Then
the thick plug of the same green material of which the partitions are
formed closes the home and keeps out marauders.In this common cradle, the chronological order of births is perfectly
clear.The first-born of the family is at the bottom of the series; the
last-born is at the top, near the closed door.The others follow from
bottom to top in the same order in which they followed in point of
time.The laying is numbered automatically; each cocoon tells us its
respective age by the place which it occupies.A number of eggs bordering on fifteen represents the entire family of
an Osmia, and my observations enable me to state that the distribution
of the sexes is not governed by any rule.All that I can say in general
is that the complete series begins with females and nearly always ends
with males.The incomplete series--those which the insect has laid in
various places--can teach us nothing in this respect, for they are only
fragments starting we know not whence; and it is impossible to tell
whether they should be ascribed to the beginning, to the end, or to an
intermediate period of the laying.To sum up: in the laying of the
Three-pronged Osmia, no order governs the succession of the sexes;
only, the series has a marked tendency to begin with females and to
finish with males.The mother occupies herself at the start with the stronger sex, the
more necessary, the better-gifted, the female sex, to which she devotes
the first flush of her laying and the fullness of her vigour; later,
when she is perhaps already at the end of her strength, she bestows
what remains of her maternal solicitude upon the weaker sex, the
less-gifted, almost negligible male sex.There are, however, other
species where this law becomes absolute, constant and regular.In order to go more deeply into this curious question I installed some
hives of a new kind on the sunniest walls of my enclosure.They
consisted of stumps of the great reed of the south, open at one end,
closed at the other by the natural knot and gathered into a sort of
enormous pan-pipe, such as Polyphemus might have employed.The
invitation was accepted: Osmiae came in fairly large numbers, to
benefit by the queer installation.Three Osmiae especially (O. Tricornis, Latr., O. cornuta, Latr., O.
Latreillii, Spin.)gave me splendid results, with reed-stumps arranged
either against the wall of my garden, as I have just said, or near
their customary abode, the huge nests of the Mason-bee of the Sheds.One of them, the Three-horned Osmia, did better still: as I have
described, she built her nests in my study, as plentifully as I could
wish.We will consult this last, who has furnished me with documents beyond
my fondest hopes, and begin by asking her of how many eggs her average
laying consists.Of the whole heap of colonized tubes in my study, or
else out of doors, in the hurdle-reeds and the pan-pipe appliances, the
best-filled contains fifteen cells, with a free space above the series,
a space showing that the laying is ended, for, if the mother had any
more eggs available, she would have lodged them in the room which she
leaves unoccupied.This string of fifteen appears to be rare; it was
the only one that I found.My attempts at indoor rearing, pursued
during two years with glass tubes or reeds, taught me that the
Three-horned Osmia is not much addicted to long series.As though to
decrease the difficulties of the coming deliverance, she prefers short
galleries, in which only a part of the laying is stacked.We must then
follow the same mother in her migration from one dwelling to the next
if we would obtain a complete census of her family.A spot of colour,
dropped on the Bee's thorax with a paint-brush while she is absorbed in
closing up the mouth of the tunnel, enables us to recognize the Osmia
in her various homes.In this way, the swarm that resided in my study furnished me, in the
first year, with an average of twelve cells.Next year, the summer
appeared to be more favourable and the average became rather higher,
reaching fifteen.The most numerous laying performed under my eyes, not
in a tube, but in a succession of Snail-shells, reached the figure of
twenty-six.On the other hand, layings of between eight and ten are not
uncommon.Lastly, taking all my records together, the result is that
the family of the Osmia fluctuates roundabout fifteen in number.I have already spoken of the great differences in size apparent in the
cells of one and the same series.The partitions, at first widely
spaced, draw gradually nearer to one another as they come closer to the
aperture, which implies roomy cells at the back and narrow cells in
front.The contents of these compartments are no less uneven between
one portion and another of the string.Without any exception known to
me, the large cells, those with which the series starts, have more
abundant provisions than the straitened cells with which the series
ends.The heap of honey and pollen in the first is twice or even thrice
as large as that in the second.In the last cells, the most recent in
date, the victuals are but a pinch of pollen, so niggardly in amount
that we wonder what will become of the larva with that meagre ration.One would think that the Osmia, when nearing the end of the laying,
attaches no importance to her last-born, to whom she doles out space
and food so sparingly.The first-born receive the benefit of her early
enthusiasm: theirs is the well-spread table, theirs the spacious
apartments.The work has begun to pall by the time that the last eggs
are laid; and the last-comers have to put up with a scurvy portion of
food and a tiny corner.The difference shows itself in another way after the cocoons are spun.The large cells, those at the back, receive the bulky cocoons; the
small ones, those in front, have cocoons only half or a third as big.Before opening them and ascertaining the sex of the Osmia inside, let
us wait for the transformation into the perfect insect, which will take
place towards the end of summer.If impatience get the better of us, we
can open them at the end of July or in August.The insect is then in
the nymphal stage; and it is easy, under this form, to distinguish the
two sexes by the length of the antennae, which are larger in the males,
and by the glassy protuberances on the forehead, the sign of the future
armour of the females.Well, the small cocoons, those in the narrow
front cells, with their scanty store of provisions, all belong to
males; the big cocoons, those in the spacious and well-stocked cells at
the back, all belong to females.The conclusion is definite: the laying of the Three-horned Osmia
consists of two distinct groups, first a group of females and then a
group of males.With my pan-pipe apparatus displayed on the walls of my enclosure and
with old hurdle-reeds left lying flat out of doors, I obtained the
Horned Osmia in fair quantities.I persuaded Latreille's Osmia to build
her nest in reeds, which she did with a zeal which I was far from
expecting.All that I had to do was to lay some reed-stumps
horizontally within her reach, in the immediate neighbourhood of her
usual haunts, namely, the nests of the Mason-bee of the Sheds.Lastly,
I succeeded without difficulty in making her build her nests in the
privacy of my study, with glass tubes for a house.With both these Osmiae, the division of the gallery is the same as with
the Three-horned Osmia.At the back are large cells with plentiful
provisions and widely-spaced partitions; in front, small cells, with
scanty provisions and partitions close together.Also, the larger cells
supplied me with big cocoons and females; the smaller cells gave me
little cocoons and males.The conclusion therefore is exactly the same
in the case of all three Osmiae.These conclusions, as my notes show, apply likewise, in every respect,
to the various species of Mason-bees; and one clear and simple rule
stands out from this collection of facts.Apart from the strange
exception of the Three-pronged Osmia, who mixes the sexes without any
order, the Bees whom I studied and probably a crowd of others produce
first a continuous series of females and then a continuous series of
males, the latter with less provisions and smaller cells.This
distribution of the sexes agrees with what we have long known of the
Hive-bee, who begins her laying with a long sequence of workers, or
sterile females, and ends it with a long sequence of males.The analogy
continues down to the capacity of the cells and the quantities of
provisions.The real females, the Queen-bees, have wax cells
incomparably more spacious than the cells of the males and receive a
much larger amount of food.Everything therefore demonstrates that we
are here in the presence of a general rule.OPTIONAL DETERMINATION OF THE SEXES.Is there nothing beyond a
laying in two series?Are the Osmiae, the Chalicodomae and the rest of
them fatally bound by this distribution of the sexes into two distinct
groups, the male group following upon the female group, without any
mixing of the two?Is the mother absolutely powerless to make a change
in this arrangement, should circumstances require it?The Three-pronged Osmia already shows us that the problem is far from
being solved.In the same bramble-stump, the two sexes occur very
irregularly, as though at random.Why this mixture in the series of
cocoons of a Bee closely related to the Horned Osmia and the
Three-horned Osmia, who stack theirs methodically by separate sexes in
the hollow of a reed?What the Bee of the brambles does cannot her
kinswomen of the reeds do too?Nothing, so far as I know, explains this
fundamental difference in a physiological act of primary importance.The three Bees belong to the same genus; they resemble one another in
general outline, internal structure and habits; and, with this close
similarity, we suddenly find a strange dissimilarity.There is just one thing that might possibly arouse a suspicion of the
cause of this irregularity in the Three-pronged Osmia's laying.If I
open a bramble-stump in the winter to examine the Osmia's nest, I find
it impossible, in the vast majority of cases, to distinguish positively
between a female and a male cocoon: the difference in size is so small.The cells, moreover, have the same capacity: the diameter of the
cylinder is the same throughout and the partitions are almost always
the same distance apart.If I open it in July, the victualling-period,
it is impossible for me to distinguish between the provisions destined
for the males and those destined for the females.The measurement of
the column of honey gives practically the same depth in all the cells.We find an equal quantity of space and food for both sexes.This result makes us foresee what a direct examination of the two sexes
in the adult form tells us.The male does not differ materially from
the female in respect of size.If he is a trifle smaller, it is
scarcely noticeable, whereas, in the Horned Osmia and the Three-horned
Osmia, the male is only half or a third the size of the female, as we
have seen from the respective bulk of their cocoons.In the Mason-bee
of the Walls there is also a difference in size, though less
pronounced.The Three-pronged Osmia has not therefore to trouble about adjusting
the dimensions of the dwelling and the quantity of the food to the sex
of the egg which she is about to lay; the measure is the same from one
end of the series to the other.It does not matter if the sexes
alternate without order: one and all will find what they need, whatever
their position in the row.The two other Osmiae, with their great
disparity in size between the two sexes, have to be careful about the
twofold consideration of board and lodging.The more I thought about this curious question, the more probable it
appeared to me that the irregular series of the Three-pronged Osmia and
the regular series of the other Osmiae and of the Bees in general were
all traceable to a common law.It seemed to me that the arrangement in
a succession first of females and then of males did not account for
everything.And I was right: that
arrangement in series is only a tiny fraction of the reality, which is
remarkable in a very different way.This is what I am going to prove by
experiment.The succession first of females and then of males is not, in fact,
invariable.Thus, the Chalicodoma, whose nests serve for two or three
generations, ALWAYS lays male eggs in the old male cells, which can be
recognized by their lesser capacity, and female eggs in the old female
cells of more spacious dimensions.This presence of both sexes at a time, even when there are but two
cells free, one spacious and the other small, proves in the plainest
fashion that the regular distribution observed in the complete nests of
recent production is here replaced by an irregular distribution,
harmonizing with the number and holding-capacity of the chambers to be
stocked.The Mason-bee has before her, let me suppose, only five vacant
cells: two larger and three smaller.The total space at her disposal
would do for about a third of the laying.Well, in the two large cells,
she puts females; in the three small cells she puts males.As we find the same sort of thing in all the old nests, we must needs
admit that the mother knows the sex of the eggs which she is going to
lay, because that egg is placed in a cell of the proper capacity.We
can go further, and admit that the mother alters the order of
succession of the sexes at her pleasure, because her layings, between
one old nest and another, are broken up into small groups of males and
females according to the exigencies of space in the actual nest which
she happens to be occupying.Here then is the Chalicodoma, when mistress of an old nest of which she
has not the power to alter the arrangement, breaking up her laying into
sections comprising both sexes just as required by the conditions
imposed upon her.She therefore decides the sex of the egg at will,
for, without this prerogative, she could not, in the chambers of the
nest which she owes to chance, deposit unerringly the sex for which
those chambers were originally built; and this happens however small
the number of chambers to be filled.When the mother herself founds the dwelling, when she lays the first
rows of bricks, the females come first and the males at the finish.But, when she is in the presence of an old nest, of which she is quite
unable to alter the general arrangement, how is she to make use of a
few vacant rooms, the large and small alike, if the sex of the egg be
already irrevocably fixed?She can only do so by abandoning the
arrangement in two consecutive rows and accommodating her laying to the
varied exigencies of the home.Either she finds it impossible to make
an economical use of the old nest, a theory refuted by the evidence, or
else she determines at will the sex of the egg which she is about to
lay.The Osmiae themselves will furnish the most conclusive evidence on the
latter point.We have seen that these Bees are not generally miners,
who themselves dig out the foundation of their cells.They make use of
the old structures of others, or else of natural retreats, such as
hollow stems, the spirals of empty shells and various hiding-places in
walls, clay or wood.Their work is confined to repairs to the house,
such as partitions and covers.There are plenty of these retreats; and
the insects would always find first-class ones if it thought of going
any distance to look for them.But the Osmia is a stay-at-home: she
returns to her birthplace and clings to it with a patience extremely
difficult to exhaust.It is here, in this little familiar corner, that
she prefers to settle her progeny.But then the apartments are few in
number and of all shapes and sizes.There are long and short ones,
spacious ones and narrow.Short of expatriating herself, a Spartan
course, she has to use them all, from first to last, for she has no
choice.Guided by these considerations, I embarked on the experiments
which I will now describe.I have said how my study became a populous hive, in which the
Three-horned Osmia built her nests in the various appliances which I
had prepared for her.Among these appliances, tubes, either of glass or
reed, predominated.There were tubes of all lengths and widths.In the
long tubes, entire or almost entire layings, with a series of females
followed by a series of males, were deposited.As I have already
referred to this result, I will not discuss it again.The short tubes
were sufficiently varied in length to lodge one or other portion of the
total laying.Basing my calculations on the respective lengths of the
cocoons of the two sexes, on the thickness of the partitions and the
final lid, I shortened some of these to the exact dimensions required
for two cocoons only, of different sexes.Well, these short tubes, whether of glass or reed, were seized upon as
eagerly as the long tubes.Moreover, they yielded this splendid result:
their contents, only a part of the total laying, always began with
female and ended with male cocoons.This order was invariable; what
varied was the number of cells in the long tubes and the proportion
between the two sorts of cocoons, sometimes males predominating and
sometimes females.When confronted with tubes too small to receive all her family, the
Osmia is in the same plight as the Mason-bee in the presence of an old
nest.She thereupon acts exactly as the Chalicodoma does.She breaks up
her laying, divides it into series as short as the room at her disposal
demands; and each series begins with females and ends with males.This
breaking up, on the one hand, into sections in all of which both sexes
are represented and the division, on the other hand, of the entire
laying into just two groups, one female, the other male, when the
length of the tube permits, surely provide us with ample evidence of
the insect's power to regulate the sex of the egg according to the
exigencies of space.And besides the exigencies of space one might perhaps venture to add
those connected with the earlier development of the males.These burst
their cocoons a couple of weeks or more before the females; they are
the first who hasten to the sweets of the almond-tree.In order to
release themselves and emerge into the glad sunlight without disturbing
the string of cocoons wherein their sisters are still sleeping, they
must occupy the upper end of the row; and this, no doubt, is the reason
that makes the Osmia end each of her broken layings with males.Being
next to the door, these impatient ones will leave the home without
upsetting the shells that are slower in hatching.I had offered at the same time to the Osmiae in my study some old nests
of the Mason-bee of the Shrubs, which are clay spheroids with
cylindrical cavities in them.These cavities are formed, as in the old
nests of the Mason-bee of the Pebbles, of the cell properly so-called
and of the exit-way which the perfect insect cut through the outer
coating at the time of its deliverance.The diameter is about 7
millimetres (.273 inch.--Translator's Note.); their depth at the centre
of the heap is 23 millimetres (.897 inch.--Translator's Note.)and at
the edge averages 14 millimetres.(.546 inch.--Translator's Note.)The deep central cells receive only the females of the Osmia; sometimes
even the two sexes together, with a partition in the middle, the female
occupying the lower and the male the upper storey.Lastly, the deeper
cavities on the circumference are allotted to females and the shallower
to males.We know that the Three-horned Osmia prefers to haunt the habitations of
the Bees who nidify in populous colonies, such as the Mason-bee of the
Sheds and the Hairy-footed Anthophora, in whose nests I have noted
similar facts.The choice rests with the mother,
who is guided by considerations of space and, according to the
accommodation at her disposal, which is frequently fortuitous and
incapable of modification, places a female in this cell and a male in
that, so that both may have a dwelling of a size suited to their
unequal development.This is the unimpeachable evidence of the numerous
and varied facts which I have set forth.People unfamiliar with insect
anatomy--the public for whom I write--would probably give the following
explanation of this marvellous prerogative of the Bee: the mother has
at her disposal a certain number of eggs, some of which are irrevocably
female and the others irrevocably male: she is able to pick out of
either group the one which she wants at the actual moment; and her
choice is decided by the holding capacity of the cell that has to be
stocked.Everything would then be limited to a judicious selection from
the heap of eggs.Should this idea occur to him, the reader must hasten to reject it.Nothing could be more false, as the most casual reference to anatomy
will show.The female reproductive apparatus of the Hymenoptera
consists generally of six ovarian tubes, something like glove-fingers,
divided into bunches of three and ending in a common canal, the
oviduct, which carries the eggs outside.Each of these glove-fingers is
fairly wide at the base, but tapers sharply towards the tip, which is
closed.It contains, arranged in a row, one after the other, like beads
on a string, a certain number of eggs, five or six for instance, of
which the lower ones are more or less developed, the middle ones
halfway towards maturity, and the upper ones very rudimentary.Every
stage of evolution is here represented, distributed regularly from
bottom to top, from the verge of maturity to the vague outlines of the
embryo.The sheath clasps its string of ovules so closely that any
inversion of the order is impossible.Besides, an inversion would
result in a gross absurdity: the replacing of a riper egg by another in
an earlier stage of development.Therefore, in each ovarian tube, in each glove-finger, the emergence of
the eggs occurs according to the order governing their arrangement in
the common sheath; and any other sequence is absolutely impossible.Moreover, at the nesting-period, the six ovarian sheaths, one by one
and each in its turn, have at their base an egg which in a very short
time swells enormously.Some hours or even a day before the laying,
that egg by itself represents or even exceeds in bulk the whole of the
ovigerous apparatus.This is the egg which is on the point of being
laid.It is about to descend into the oviduct, in its proper order, at
its proper time; and the mother has no power to make another take its
place.It is this egg, necessarily this egg and no other, that will
presently be laid upon the provisions, whether these be a mess of honey
or a live prey; it alone is ripe, it alone lies at the entrance to the
oviduct; none of the others, since they are farther back in the row and
not at the right stage of development, can be substituted at this
crisis.What will it yield, a male or a female?No lodging has been prepared,
no food collected for it; and yet both food and lodging have to be in
keeping with the sex that will proceed from it.And here is a much more
puzzling condition: the sex of that egg, whose advent is predestined,
has to correspond with the space which the mother happens to have found
for a cell.There is therefore no room for hesitation, strange though
the statement may appear: the egg, as it descends from its ovarian
tube, has no determined sex.It is perhaps during the few hours of its
rapid development at the base of its ovarian sheath, it is perhaps on
its passage through the oviduct that it receives, at the mother's
pleasure, the final impress that will produce, to match the cradle
which it has to fill, either a female or a male.Let us admit that,
when the normal conditions remain, a laying would have yielded m
females and n males.Then, if my conclusions are correct, it must be in
the mother's power, when the conditions are different, to take from the
m group and increase the n group to the same extent; it must be
possible for her laying to be represented as m - 1, m - 2, m - 3, etc.females and by n + 1, n + 2, n + 3, etc.males, the sum of m + n
remaining constant, but one of the sexes being partly permuted into the
other.The ultimate conclusion even cannot be disregarded: we must
admit a set of eggs represented by m - m, or zero, females and of n + m
males, one of the sexes being completely replaced by the other.Conversely, it must be possible for the feminine series to be augmented
from the masculine series to the extent of absorbing it entirely.It
was to solve this question and some others connected with it that I
undertook, for the second time, to rear the Three-horned Osmia in my
study.The problem on this occasion is a more delicate one; but I am also
better-equipped.My apparatus consists of two small closed
packing-cases, with the front side of each pierced with forty holes, in
which I can insert my glass tubes and keep them in a horizontal
position.I thus obtain for the Bees the darkness and mystery which
suit their work and for myself the power of withdrawing from my hive,
at any time, any tube that I wish, with the Osmia inside, so as to
carry it to the light and follow, if need be with the aid of the lens,
the operations of the busy worker.My investigations, however frequent
and minute, in no way hinder the peaceable Bee, who remains absorbed in
her maternal duties.I mark a plentiful number of my guests with a variety of dots on the
thorax, which enables me to follow any one Osmia from the beginning to
the end of her laying.The tubes and their respective holes are
numbered; a list, always lying open on my desk, enables me to note from
day to day, sometimes from hour to hour, what happens in each tube and
particularly the actions of the Osmiae whose backs bear distinguishing
marks.As soon as one tube is filled, I replace it by another.Moreover, I have scattered in front of either hive a few handfuls of
empty Snail-shells, specially chosen for the object which I have in
view.Reasons which I will explain later led me to prefer the shells of
Helix caespitum.Each of the shells, as and when stocked, received the
date of the laying and the alphabetical sign corresponding with the
Osmia to whom it belonged.In this way, I spent five or six weeks in
continual observation.To succeed in an enquiry, the first and foremost
condition is patience.This condition I fulfilled; and it was rewarded
with the success which I was justified in expecting.The first, which are cylindrical
and of the same width throughout, will be of use for confirming the
facts observed in the first year of my experiments in indoor rearing.The others, the majority, consist of two cylinders which are of very
different diameters, set end to end.The front cylinder, the one which
projects a little way outside the hive and forms the entrance-hole,
varies in width between 8 and 12 millimetres.(Between.312 and.468
inch.--Translator's Note.)The second, the back one, contained entirely
within my packing-case, is closed at its far end and is 5 to 6
millimetres in diameter.(.195 to.234 inch.--Translator's Note.)Each
of the two parts of the double-galleried tunnel, one narrow and one
wide, measures at most a decimetre in length.(3.9
inches.--Translator's Note.)I thought it advisable to have these short
tubes, as the Osmia is thus compelled to select different lodgings,
each of them being insufficient in itself to accommodate the total
laying.In this way I shall obtain a greater variety in the
distribution of the sexes.Lastly, at the mouth of each tube, which
projects slightly outside the case, there is a little paper tongue,
forming a sort of perch on which the Osmia alights on her arrival and
giving easy access to the house.With these facilities, the swarm
colonized fifty-two double-galleried tubes, thirty-seven cylindrical
tubes, seventy-eight Snail-shells and a few old nests of the Mason-bee
of the Shrubs.From this rich mine of material I will take what I want
to prove my case.Every series, even when incomplete, begins with females and ends with
males.To this rule I have not yet found an exception, at least in
galleries of normal diameter.In each new abode the mother busies
herself first of all with the more important sex.Bearing this point in
mind, would it be possible for me, by manoeuvring, to obtain an
inversion of this order and make the laying begin with males?I think
so, from the results already ascertained and the irresistible
conclusions to be drawn from them.The double-galleried tubes are
installed in order to put my conjectures to the proof.The back gallery, 5 or 6 millimetres wide (.195 to.234
inch.--Translator's Note.), is too narrow to serve as a lodging for
normally developed females.If, therefore, the Osmia, who is very
economical of her space, wishes to occupy them, she will be obliged to
establish males there.And her laying must necessarily begin here,
because this corner is the rear-most part of the tube.The foremost
gallery is wide, with an entrance-door on the front of the hive.Here,
finding the conditions to which she is accustomed, the mother will go
on with her laying in the order which she prefers.Of the fifty-two double-galleried
tubes, about a third did not have their narrow passage colonized.The
Osmia closed its aperture communicating with the large passage; and the
latter alone received the eggs.The
female Osmiae, though nearly always larger than the males, present
marked differences among one another: some are bigger, some are
smaller.I had to adjust the width of the narrow galleries to Bees of
average dimensions.It may happen therefore that a gallery is too small
to admit the large-sized mothers to whom chance allots it.When the
Osmia is unable to enter the tube, obviously she will not colonize it.She then closes the entrance to this space which she cannot use and
does her laying beyond it, in the wide tube.Had I tried to avoid these
useless apparatus by choosing tubes of larger calibre, I should have
encountered another drawback: the medium-sized mothers, finding
themselves almost comfortable, would have decided to lodge females
there.I had to be prepared for it: as each mother selected her house
at will and as I was unable to interfere in her choice, a narrow tube
would be colonized or not, according as the Osmia who owned it was or
was not able to make her way inside.There remain some forty pairs of tubes with both galleries colonized.In these there are two things to take into consideration.The narrow
rear tubes of 5 or 5 1/2 millimetres (.195 to.214 inch.--Translator's
Note.)--and these are the most numerous--contain males and males only,
but in short series, between one and five.The mother is here so much
hampered in her work that they are rarely occupied from end to end; the
Osmia seems in a hurry to leave them and to go and colonize the front
tube, whose ample space will leave her the liberty of movement
necessary for her operations.The other rear tubes, the minority, whose
diameter is about 6 millimetres (.234 inch.--Translator's Note.),
contain sometimes only females and sometimes females at the back and
males towards the opening.One can see that a tube a trifle wider and a
mother slightly smaller would account for this difference in the
results.Nevertheless, as the necessary space for a female is barely
provided in this case, we see that the mother avoids as far as she can
a two-sex arrangement beginning with males and that she adopts it only
in the last extremity.Finally, whatever the contents of the small tube
may be, those of the large one, following upon it, never vary and
consist of females at the back and males in front.Though incomplete, because of circumstances very difficult to control,
the result of the experiment is none the less very remarkable.Twenty-five apparatus contain only males in their narrow gallery, in
numbers varying from a minimum of one to a maximum of five.After these
comes the colony of the large gallery, beginning with females and
ending with males.And the layings in these apparatus do not always
belong to late summer or even to the intermediate period: a few small
tubes contain the earliest eggs of the entire swarm.A couple of
Osmiae, more forward than the others, set to work on the 23rd of April.Both of them started their laying by placing males in the narrow tubes.The meagre supply of provisions was enough in itself to show the sex,
which proved later to be in accordance with my anticipations.We see
then that, by my artifices, the whole swarm starts with the converse of
the normal order.This inversion is continued, at no matter what
period, from the beginning to the end of the operations.The series
which, according to rule, would begin with females now begins with
males.Once the larger gallery is reached, the laying is pursued in the
usual order.We have advanced one step and that no small one: we have seen that the
Osmia, when circumstances require it, is capable of reversing the
sequence of the sexes.Would it be possible, provided that the tube
were long enough, to obtain a complete inversion, in which the entire
series of the males should occupy the narrow gallery at the back and
the entire series of the females the roomy gallery in front?I think
not; and I will tell you why.Long and narrow cylinders are by no means to the Osmia's taste, not
because of their narrowness but because of their length.Observe that
for each load of honey brought the worker is obliged to move backwards
twice.She enters, head first, to begin by disgorging the honey-syrup
from her crop.Unable to turn in a passage which she blocks entirely,
she goes out backwards, crawling rather than walking, a laborious
performance on the polished surface of the glass and a performance
which, with any other surface, would still be very awkward, as the
wings are bound to rub against the wall with their free end and are
liable to get rumpled or bent.She goes out backwards, reaches the
outside, turns round and goes in again, but this time the opposite way,
so as to brush off the load of pollen from her abdomen on to the heap.If the gallery is at all long, this crawling backwards becomes
troublesome after a time; and the Osmia soon abandons a passage that is
too small to allow of free movement.I have said that the narrow tubes
of my apparatus are, for the most part, only very incompletely
colonized.The Bee, after lodging a small number of males in them,
hastens to leave them.In the wide front gallery she can stay where she
is and still be able to turn round easily for her different
manipulations; she will avoid those two long journeys backwards, which
are so exhausting and so bad for her wings.Another reason no doubt prompts her not to make too great a use of the
narrow passage, in which she would establish males, followed by females
in the part where the gallery widens.The males have to leave their
cells a couple of weeks or more before the females.If they occupy the
back of the house they will die prisoners or else they will overturn
everything on their way out.This risk is avoided by the order which
the Osmia adopts.In my tubes, with their unusual arrangement, the mother might well find
the dilemma perplexing: there is the narrowness of the space at her
disposal and there is the emergence later on.In the narrow tubes, the
width is insufficient for the females; on the other hand, if she lodges
males there, they are liable to perish, since they will be prevented
from issuing at the proper moment.This would perhaps explain the
mother's hesitation and her obstinacy in settling females in some of my
apparatus which looked as if they could suit none but males.A suspicion occurs to me, a suspicion aroused by my attentive
examination of the narrow tubes.All, whatever the number of their
inmates, are carefully plugged at the opening, just as separate tubes
would be.It might therefore be the case that the narrow gallery at the
back was looked upon by the Osmia not as the prolongation of the large
front gallery, but as an independent tube.The facility with which the
worker turns as soon as she reaches the wide tube, her liberty of
action, which is now as great as in a doorway communicating with the
outer air, might well be misleading and cause the Osmia to treat the
narrow passage at the back as though the wide passage in front did not
exist.This would account for the placing of the female in the large
tube above the males in the small tube, an arrangement contrary to her
custom.I will not undertake to decide whether the mother really appreciates
the danger of my snares, or whether she makes a mistake in considering
only the space at her disposal and beginning with males, who are liable
to remain imprisoned.At any rate, I perceive a tendency to deviate as
little as possible from the order which safeguards the emergence of
both sexes.This tendency is demonstrated by her repugnance to
colonizing my narrow tubes with long series of males.However, so far
as we are concerned, it does not matter much what passes at such times
in the Osmia's little brain.Enough for us to know that she dislikes
narrow and long tubes, not because they are narrow, but because they
are at the same time long.And, in fact, she does very well with a short tube of the same
diameter.Such are the cells in the old nests of the Mason-bee of the
Shrubs and the empty shells of the Garden Snail.With the short tube
the two disadvantages of the long tube are avoided.She has very little
of that crawling backwards to do when she has a Snail-shell for the
home of her eggs and scarcely any when the home is the cell of the
Mason-bee.Moreover, as the stack of cocoons numbers two or three at
most, the deliverance will be exempt from the difficulties attached to
a long series.To persuade the Osmia to nidify in a single tube long
enough to receive the whole of her laying and at the same time narrow
enough to leave her only just the possibility of admittance appears to
me a project without the slightest chance of success: the Bee would
stubbornly refuse such a dwelling or would content herself with
entrusting only a very small portion of her eggs to it.On the other
hand, with narrow but short cavities, success, without being easy,
seems to me at least quite possible.Guided by these considerations, I
embarked upon the most arduous part of my problem: to obtain the
complete or almost complete permutation of one sex with the other; to
produce a laying consisting only of males by offering the mother a
series of lodgings suited only to males.Let us in the first place consult the old nests of the Mason-bee of the
Shrubs.I have said that these mortar spheroids, pierced all over with
little cylindrical cavities, are a adopted pretty eagerly by the
Three-horned Osmia, who colonizes them before my eyes with females in
the deep cells and males in the shallow cells.That is how things go
when the old nest remains in its natural state.With a grater, however,
I scrape the outside of another nest so as to reduce the depth of the
cavities to some ten millimetres.(About two-fifths of an
inch.--Translator's Note.)This leaves in each cell just room for one
cocoon, surmounted by the closing stopper.Of the fourteen cavities in
the nests, I leave two intact, measuring fifteen millimetres in depth.(.585 inch.--Translator's Note.)Nothing could be more striking than
the result of this experiment, made in the first year of my home
rearing.The twelve cavities whose depth had been reduced all received
males; the two cavities left untouched received females.A year passes and I repeat the experiment with a nest of fifteen cells;
but this time all the cells are reduced to the minimum depth with the
grater.Well, the fifteen cells, from first to last, are occupied by
males.It must be quite understood that, in each case, all the
offspring belonged to one mother, marked with her distinguishing dot
and kept in sight as long as her laying lasted.He would indeed be
difficult to please who refused to bow before the results of these two
experiments.If, however, he is not yet convinced, here is something to
remove his last doubts.The Three-horned Osmia often settles her family in old shells,
especially those of the Common Snail (Helix aspersa), who is so common
under the stone-heaps and in the crevices of the little unmortared
walls that support our terraces.In this species the spiral is wide
open, so that the Osmia, penetrating as far down as the helical passage
permits, finds, immediately above the point which is too narrow to
pass, the space necessary for the cell of a female.This cell is
succeeded by others, wider still, always for females, arranged in a
line in the same way as in a straight tube.In the last whorl of the
spiral, the diameter would be too great for a single row.Then
longitudinal partitions are added to the transverse partitions, the
whole resulting in cells of unequal dimensions in which males
predominate, mixed with a few females in the lower storeys.The
sequence of the sexes is therefore what it would be in a straight tube
and especially in a tube with a wide bore, where the partitioning is
complicated by subdivisions on the same level.A single Snail-shell
contains room for six or eight cells.A large, rough earthen stopper
finishes the nest at the entrance to the shell.As a dwelling of this sort could show us nothing new, I chose for my
swarm the Garden Snail (Helix caespitum), whose shell, shaped like a
small swollen Ammonite, widens by slow degrees, the diameter of the
usable portion, right up to the mouth, being hardly greater than that
required by a male Osmia-cocoon.Moreover, the widest part, in which a
female might find room, has to receive a thick stopping-plug, below
which there will often be a free space.Under all these conditions, the
house will hardly suit any but males arranged one after the other.The collection of shells placed at the foot of each hive includes
specimens of different sizes.The smallest are 18 millimetres (.7
inch.--Translator's Note.)in diameter and the largest 24 millimetres.(.936 inch.--Translator's Note.)There is room for two cocoons, or
three at most, according to their dimensions.Now these shells were used by my visitors without any hesitation,
perhaps even with more eagerness than the glass tubes, whose slippery
sides might easily be a little annoying to the Bee.Some of them were
occupied on the first few days of the laying; and the Osmia who had
started with a home of this sort would pass next to a second
Snail-shell, in the immediate neighbourhood of the first, to a third, a
fourth and others still, always close together, until her ovaries were
emptied.The whole family of one mother would thus be lodged in
Snail-shells which were duly marked with the date of the laying and a
description of the worker.The faithful adherents of the Snail-shell
were in the minority.The greater number left the tubes to come to the
shells and then went back from the shells to the tubes.All, after
filling the spiral staircase with two or three cells, closed the house
with a thick earthen stopper on a level with the opening.It was a long
and troublesome task, in which the Osmia displayed all her patience as
a mother and all her talents as a plasterer.When the pupae are sufficiently matured, I proceed to examine these
elegant abodes.The contents fill me with joy: they fulfil my
anticipations to the letter.The great, the very great majority of the
cocoons turn out to be males; here and there, in the bigger cells, a
few rare females appear.The smallness of the space has almost done
away with the stronger sex.This result is demonstrated by the
sixty-eight Snail-shells colonized.But, of this total number, I must
use only those series which received an entire laying and were occupied
by the same Osmia from the beginning to the end of the egg-season.Here
are a few examples, taken from among the most conclusive.From the 6th of May, when she started operations, to the 25th of May,
the date at which her laying ceased, one Osmia occupied seven
Snail-shells in succession.Her family consists of fourteen cocoons, a
number very near the average; and, of these fourteen cocoons, twelve
belong to males and only two to females.Another, between the 9th and 27th of May, stocked six Snail-shells with
a family of thirteen, including ten males and three females.A third, between the 2nd and 29th of May colonized eleven Snail-shells,
a prodigious task.She supplied me with a family of twenty-six, the largest which I have
ever obtained from one Osmia.Well, this abnormal progeny consisted of
twenty-five males and one female.There is no need to go on, after this magnificent example, especially
as the other series would all, without exception, give us the same
result.Two facts are immediately obvious: the Osmia is able to reverse
the order of her laying and to start with a more or less long series of
males before producing any females.There is something better still;
and this is the proposition which I was particularly anxious to prove:
the female sex can be permuted with the male sex and can be permuted to
the point of disappearing altogether.We see this especially in the
third case, where the presence of a solitary female in a family of
twenty-six is due to the somewhat larger diameter of the corresponding
Snail-shell.There would still remain the inverse permutation: to obtain only
females and no males, or very few.The first permutation makes the
second seem very probable, although I cannot as yet conceive a means of
realizing it.The only condition which I can regulate is the dimensions
of the home.When the rooms are small, the males abound and the females
tend to disappear.With generous quarters, the converse would not take
place.I should obtain females and afterwards an equal number of males,
confined in small cells which, in case of need, would be bounded by
numerous partitions.The factor of space does not enter into the
question here.What artifice can we then employ to provoke this second
permutation?So far, I can think of nothing that is worth attempting.Leading a retired life, in the solitude of a
village, having quite enough to do with patiently and obscurely
ploughing my humble furrow, I know little about modern scientific
views.In my young days I had a passionate longing for books and found
it difficult to procure them; to-day, when I could almost have them if
I wanted, I am ceasing to wish for them.It is what usually happens as
life goes on.I do not therefore know what may have been done in the
direction whither this study of the sexes has led me.If I am stating
propositions that are really new or at least more comprehensive than
the propositions already known, my words will perhaps sound heretical.No matter: as a simple translator of facts, I do not hesitate to make
my statement, being fully persuaded that time will turn my heresy into
orthodoxy.Bees lay their eggs in series of first females and then males, when the
two sexes are of different sizes and demand an unequal quantity of
nourishment.When the two sexes are alike in size, as in the case of
Latreille's Osmia, the same sequence may occur, but less regularly.This dual arrangement disappears when the place chosen for the nest is
not large enough to contain the entire laying.We then see broken
layings, beginning with females and ending with males.The egg, as it issues from the ovary, has not yet a fixed sex.The
final impress that produces the sex is given at the moment of laying,
or a little before.So as to be able to give each larva the amount of space and food that
suits it according as it is male or female, the mother can choose the
sex of the egg which she is about to lay.To meet the conditions of the
building, which is often the work of another or else a natural retreat
that admits of little or no alteration, she lays either a male egg or a
female egg AS SHE PLEASES.The distribution of the sexes depends upon
herself.Should circumstances require it, the order of the laying can
be reversed and begin with males; lastly, the entire laying can contain
only one sex.The same privilege is possessed by the predatory Hymenoptera, the
Wasps, at least by those in whom the two sexes are of a different size
and consequently require an amount of nourishment that is larger in the
one case than in the other.The mother must know the sex of the egg
which she is going to lay; she must be able to choose the sex of that
egg so that each larva may obtain its proper portion of food.Generally speaking, when the sexes are of different sizes, every insect
that collects food and prepares or selects a dwelling for its offspring
must be able to choose the sex of the egg in order to satisfy without
mistake the conditions imposed upon it.The question remains how this optional assessment of the sexes is
effected.If I should ever learn
anything about this delicate point, I shall owe it to some happy chance
for which I must wait, or rather watch, patiently.Then what explanation shall I give of the wonderful facts which I have
set forth?I do not explain facts, I relate
them.Growing daily more sceptical of the interpretations suggested to
me and more hesitating as to those which I myself may have to suggest,
the more I observe and experiment, the more clearly I see rising out of
the black mists of possibility an enormous note of interrogation.Dear insects, my study of you has sustained me and continues to sustain
me in my heaviest trials; I must take leave of you for to-day.The
ranks are thinning around me and the long hopes have fled.Shall I be
able to speak of you again?(This forms the closing paragraph of Volume
3 of the "Souvenirs entomologiques," of which the author lived to
publish seven more volumes, containing over 2,500 pages and nearly
850,000 words.--Translator's Note.)Few insects in our climes vie in popular fame with the Glow-worm, that
curious little animal which, to celebrate the little joys of life,
kindles a beacon at its tail-end.Who does not know it, at least by
name?Who has not seen it roam amid the grass, like a spark fallen from
the moon at its full?The Greeks of old called it lampouris, meaning,
the bright-tailed.Science employs the same term: it calls it the
lantern-bearer, Lampyris noctiluca, Lin.In this case the common name
is inferior to the scientific phrase, which, when translated, becomes
both expressive and accurate.In fact, we might easily cavil at the word "worm."The Lampyris is not
a worm at all, not even in general appearance.He has six short legs,
which he well knows how to use; he is a gad-about, a trot-about.In the
adult state the male is correctly garbed in wing-cases, like the true
Beetle that he is.The female is an ill-favoured thing who knows naught
of the delights of flying: all her life long she retains the larval
shape, which, for the rest, is similar to that of the male, who himself
is imperfect so long as he has not achieved the maturity that comes
with pairing-time.Even in this initial stage the word "worm" is out of
place.We French have the expression "Naked as a worm" to point to the
lack of any defensive covering.Now the Lampyris is clothed, that is to
say, he wears an epidermis of some consistency; moreover, he is rather
richly : his body is dark brown all over, set off with pale
pink on the thorax, especially on the lower surface.Finally, each
segment is decked at the hinder edge with two spots of a fairly bright
red.A costume like this was never worn by a worm.Let us leave this ill-chosen denomination and ask ourselves what the
Lampyris feeds upon.That master of the art of gastronomy,
Brillat-Savarin, said: "Show me what you eat and I will tell you what
you are."A similar question should be addressed, by way of a preliminary, to
every insect whose habits we propose to study, for, from the least to
the greatest in the zoological progression, the stomach sways the
world; the data supplied by food are the chief of all the documents of
life.Well, in spite of his innocent appearance, the Lampyris is an
eater of flesh, a hunter of game; and he follows his calling with rare
villainy.This detail has long been known to entomologists.What is not so well
known, what is not known at all yet, to judge by what I have read, is
the curious method of attack, of which I have seen no other instance
anywhere.Before he begins to feast, the Glow-worm administers an anaesthetic: he
chloroforms his victim, rivalling in the process the wonders of our
modern surgery, which renders the patient insensible before operating
on him.The usual game is a small Snail hardly the size of a cherry,
such as, for instance, Helix variabilis, Drap., who, in the hot
weather, collects in clusters on the stiff stubble and other long, dry
stalks by the road-side and there remains motionless, in profound
meditation, throughout the scorching summer days.It is in some such
resting-place as this that I have often been privileged to light upon
the Lampyris banqueting on the prey which he had just paralysed on its
shaky support by his surgical artifices.He frequents the edges of the
irrigating ditches, with their cool soil, their varied vegetation, a
favourite haunt of the Mollusc.Here, he treats the game on the ground;
and, under these conditions, it is easy for me to rear him at home and
to follow the operator's performance down to the smallest detail.I will try to make the reader a witness of the strange sight.I place a
little grass in a wide glass jar.In this I instal a few Glow-worms and
a provision of snails of a suitable size, neither too large nor too
small, chiefly Helix variabilis.Above
all, we must keep an assiduous watch, for the desired events come
unexpectedly and do not last long.The Glow-worm for a moment investigates the prey,
which, according to its habit, is wholly withdrawn in the shell, except
the edge of the mantle, which projects slightly.Then the hunter's
weapon is drawn, a very simple weapon, but one that cannot be plainly
perceived without the aid of a lens.It consists of two mandibles bent
back powerfully into a hook, very sharp and as thin as a hair.The
microscope reveals the presence of a slender groove running throughout
the length.The insect repeatedly taps the Snail's mantle with its instrument.It
all happens with such gentleness as to suggest kisses rather than
bites.As children, teasing one another, we used to talk of "tweaksies"
to express a slight squeeze of the finger-tips, something more like a
tickling than a serious pinch.In conversing with
animals, language loses nothing by remaining juvenile.It is the right
way for the simple to understand one another.The Lampyris doles out his tweaks.He distributes them methodically,
without hurrying, and takes a brief rest after each of them, as though
he wished to ascertain the effect produced.Their number is not great:
half a dozen, at most, to subdue the prey and deprive it of all power
of movement.That other pinches are administered later, at the time of
eating, seems very likely, but I cannot say anything for certain,
because the sequel escapes me.The first few, however--there are never
many--are enough to impart inertia and loss of all feeling to the
Mollusc, thanks to the prompt, I might almost say lightning, methods of
the Lampyris, who, beyond a doubt, instils some poison or other by
means of his grooved hooks.Here is the proof of the sudden efficacy of those twitches, so mild in
appearance: I take the Snail from the Lampyris, who has operated on the
edge of the mantle some four or five times.I prick him with a fine
needle in the fore-part, which the animal, shrunk into its shell, still
leaves exposed.There is no quiver of the wounded tissues, no reaction
against the brutality of the needle.A corpse itself could not give
fewer signs of life.Here is something even more conclusive: chance occasionally gives me
Snails attacked by the Lampyris while they are creeping along, the foot
slowly crawling, the tentacles swollen to their full extent.A few
disordered movements betray a brief excitement on the part of the
Mollusc and then everything ceases: the foot no longer slugs; the front
part loses its graceful swan-neck curve; the tentacles become limp and
give way under their own weight, dangling feebly like a broken stick.Not at all, for I can resuscitate the seeming
corpse at will.After two or three days of that singular condition
which is no longer life and yet not death, I isolate the patient and,
though this is not really essential to success, I give him a douche
which will represent the shower so dear to the able-bodied Mollusc.In
about a couple of days, my prisoner, but lately injured by the
Glow-worm's treachery, is restored to his normal state.He revives, in
a manner; he recovers movement and sensibility.He is affected by the
stimulus of a needle; he shifts his place, crawls, puts out his
tentacles, as though nothing unusual had occurred.The general torpor,
a sort of deep drunkenness, has vanished outright.What name shall we give to that form of existence which, for a
time, abolishes the power of movement and the sense of pain?I can see
but one that is approximately suitable: anaesthesia.The exploits of a
host of Wasps whose flesh-eating grubs are provided with meat that is
motionless though not dead have taught us the skilful art of the
paralysing insect, which numbs the locomotory nerve-centres with its
venom.We have now a humble little animal that first produces complete
anaesthesia in its patient.Human science did not in reality invent
this art, which is one of the wonders of latter-day surgery.Much
earlier, far back in the centuries, the Lampyris and, apparently,
others knew it as well.The animal's knowledge had a long start of
ours; the method alone has changed.Our operators proceed by making us
inhale the fumes of ether or chloroform; the insect proceeds by
injecting a special virus that comes from the mandibular fangs in
infinitesimal doses.Might we not one day be able to benefit from this
hint?What glorious discoveries the future would have in store for us,
if we understood the beastie's secrets better!What does the Lampyris want with anaesthetical talent against a
harmless and moreover eminently peaceful adversary, who would never
begin the quarrel of his own accord?We find in Algeria
a beetle known as Drilus maroccanus, who, though non-luminous,
approaches our Glow-worm in his organization and especially in his
habits.He, too, feeds on Land Molluscs.His prey is a Cyclostome with
a graceful spiral shell, tightly closed with a stony lid which is
attached to the animal by a powerful muscle.The lid is a movable door
which is quickly shut by the inmate's mere withdrawal into his house
and as easily opened when the hermit goes forth.With this system of
closing, the abode becomes inviolable; and the Drilus knows it.Fixed to the surface of the shell by an adhesive apparatus whereof the
Lampyris will presently show us the equivalent, he remains on the
look-out, waiting, if necessary, for whole days at a time.At last the
need of air and food obliges the besieged non-combatant to show
himself: at least, the door is set slightly ajar.The
Drilus is on the spot and strikes his blow.The door can no longer be
closed; and the assailant is henceforth master of the fortress.Our
first impression is that the muscle moving the lid has been cut with a
quick-acting pair of shears.The Drilus is
not well enough equipped with jaws to gnaw through a fleshy mass so
promptly.The operation has to succeed at once, at the first touch: if
not, the animal attacked would retreat, still in full vigour, and the
siege must be recommenced, as arduous as ever, exposing the insect to
fasts indefinitely prolonged.Although I have never come across the
Drilus, who is a stranger to my district, I conjecture a method of
attack very similar to that of the Glow-worm.Like our own Snail-eater,
the Algerian insect does not cut its victim into small pieces: it
renders it inert, chloroforms it by means of a few tweaks which are
easily distributed, if the lid but half-opens for a second.The besieger thereupon enters and, in perfect quiet, consumes a
prey incapable of the least muscular effort.That is how I see things
by the unaided light of logic.Let us now return to the Glow-worm.When the Snail is on the ground,
creeping, or even shrunk into his shell, the attack never presents any
difficulty.The shell possesses no lid and leaves the hermit's
fore-part to a great extent exposed.Here, on the edges of the mantle,
contracted by the fear of danger, the Mollusc is vulnerable and
incapable of defence.But it also frequently happens that the Snail
occupies a raised position, clinging to the tip of a grass-stalk or
perhaps to the smooth surface of a stone.This support serves him as a
temporary lid; it wards off the aggression of any churl who might try
to molest the inhabitant of the cabin, always on the express condition
that no slit show itself anywhere on the protecting circumference.If,
on the other hand, in the frequent case when the shell does not fit its
support quite closely, some point, however tiny, be left uncovered,
this is enough for the subtle tools of the Lampyris, who just nibbles
at the Mollusc and at once plunges him into that profound immobility
which favours the tranquil proceedings of the consumer.The assailant has to
handle his victim gingerly, without provoking contractions which would
make the Snail let go his support and, at the very least, precipitate
him from the tall stalk whereon he is blissfully slumbering.Now any
game falling to the ground would seem to be so much sheer loss, for the
Glow-worm has no great zeal for hunting-expeditions: he profits by the
discoveries which good luck sends him, without undertaking assiduous
searches.It is essential, therefore, that the equilibrium of a prize
perched on the top of a stalk and only just held in position by a touch
of glue should be disturbed as little as possible during the onslaught;
it is necessary that the assailant should go to work with infinite
circumspection and without producing pain, lest any muscular reaction
should provoke a fall and endanger the prize.As we see, sudden and
profound anaesthesia is an excellent means of enabling the Lampyris to
attain his object, which is to consume his prey in perfect quiet.Does he really eat, that is to say,
does he divide his food piecemeal, does he carve it into minute
particles, which are afterwards ground by a chewing-apparatus?I never see a trace of solid nourishment on my captives' mouths.The Glow-worm does not eat in the strict sense of the word: he drinks
his fill; he feeds on a thin gruel into which he transforms his prey by
a method recalling that of the maggot.Like the flesh-eating grub of
the Fly, he too is able to digest before consuming; he liquefies his
prey before feeding on it.This is how things happen: a Snail has been rendered insensible by the
Glow-worm.The operator is nearly always alone, even when the prize is
a large one, like the common Snail, Helix aspersa.Soon a number of
guests hasten up--two, three, or more--and, without any quarrel with
the real proprietor, all alike fall to.Let us leave them to themselves
for a couple of days and then turn the shell, with the opening
downwards.The contents flow out as easily as would soup from an
overturned saucepan.When the sated diners retire from this gruel, only
insignificant leavings remain.By repeated tiny bites, similar to the tweaks
which we saw distributed at the outset, the flesh of the Mollusc is
converted into a gruel on which the various banqueters nourish
themselves without distinction, each working at the broth by means of
some special pepsine and each taking his own mouthfuls of it.In
consequence of this method, which first converts the food into a
liquid, the Glow-worm's mouth must be very feebly armed apart from the
two fangs which sting the patient and inject the anaesthetic poison and
at the same time, no doubt, the serum capable of turning the solid
flesh into fluid.Those two tiny implements, which can just be examined
through the lens, must, it seems, have some other object.They are
hollow, and in this resemble those of the Ant-lion, who sucks and
drains her capture without having to divide it; but there is this great
difference, that the Ant-lion leaves copious remnants, which are
afterwards flung outside the funnel-shaped trap dug in the sand,
whereas the Glow-worm, that expert liquifier, leaves nothing, or next
to nothing.With similar tools, the one simply sucks the blood of his
prey and the other turns every morsel of his to account, thanks to a
preliminary liquefaction.And this is done with exquisite precision, though the equilibrium is
sometimes anything but steady.My rearing-glasses supply me with
magnificent examples.Crawling up the sides, the Snails imprisoned in
my apparatus sometimes reach the top, which is closed with a glass
pane, and fix themselves to it with a speck of glair.This is a mere
temporary halt, in which the Mollusc is miserly with his adhesive
product, and the merest shake is enough to loosen the shell and send it
to the bottom of the jar.Now it is not unusual for the Glow-worm to hoist himself up there, with
the help of a certain climbing-organ that makes up for his weak legs.He selects his quarry, makes a minute inspection of it to find an
entrance-slit, nibbles at it a little, renders it insensible and,
without delay, proceeds to prepare the gruel which he will consume for
days on end.When he leaves the table, the shell is found to be absolutely empty;
and yet this shell, which was fixed to the glass by a very faint
stickiness, has not come loose, has not even shifted its position in
the smallest degree: without any protest from the hermit gradually
converted into broth, it has been drained on the very spot at which the
first attack was delivered.These small details tell us how promptly
the anaesthetic bite takes effect; they teach us how dexterously the
Glow-worm treats his Snail without causing him to fall from a very
slippery, vertical support and without even shaking him on his slight
line of adhesion.Under these conditions of equilibrium, the operator's short, clumsy
legs are obviously not enough; a special accessory apparatus is needed
to defy the danger of slipping and to seize the unseizable.And this
apparatus the Lampyris possesses.At the hinder end of the animal we
see a white spot which the lens separates into some dozen short, fleshy
appendages, sometimes gathered into a cluster, sometimes spread into a
rosette.There is your organ of adhesion and locomotion.If he would
fix himself somewhere, even on a very smooth surface, such as a
grass-stalk, the Glow-worm opens his rosette and spreads it wide on the
support, to which it adheres by its own stickiness.The same organ,
rising and falling, opening and closing, does much to assist the act of
progression.In short, the Glow-worm is a new sort of self-propelled
<DW36>, who decks his hind-quarters with a dainty white rose, a kind
of hand with twelve fingers, not jointed, but moving in every
direction: tubular fingers which do not seize, but stick.The same organ serves another purpose: that of a toilet-sponge and
brush.At a moment of rest, after a meal, the Glow-worm passes and
repasses the said brush over his head, back, sides and hinder parts, a
performance made possible by the flexibility of his spine.This is done
point by point, from one end of the body to the other, with a
scrupulous persistency that proves the great interest which he takes in
the operation.What is his object in thus sponging himself, in dusting
and polishing himself so carefully?It is a question, apparently, of
removing a few atoms of dust or else some traces of viscidity that
remain from the evil contact with the Snail.A wash and brush-up is not
superfluous when one leaves the tub in which the Mollusc has been
treated.If the Glow-worm possessed no other talent than that of chloroforming
his prey by means of a few tweaks resembling kisses, he would be
unknown to the vulgar herd; but he also knows how to light himself like
a beacon; he shines, which is an excellent manner of achieving fame.Let us consider more particularly the female, who, while retaining her
larval shape, becomes marriageable and glows at her best during the
hottest part of summer.The lighting-apparatus occupies the last three
segments of the abdomen.On each of the first two it takes the form, on
the ventral surface, of a wide belt covering almost the whole of the
arch; on the third the luminous part is much less and consists simply
of two small crescent-shaped markings, or rather two spots which shine
through to the back and are visible both above and below the animal.Belts and spots emit a glorious white light, delicately tinged with
blue.The general lighting of the Glow-worm thus comprises two groups:
first, the wide belts of the two segments preceding the last; secondly,
the two spots of the final segments.The two belts, the exclusive
attribute of the marriageable female, are the parts richest in light:
to glorify her wedding, the future mother dons her brightest gauds; she
lights her two resplendent scarves.But, before that, from the time of
the hatching, she had only the modest rush-light of the stern.This
efflorescence of light is the equivalent of the final metamorphosis,
which is usually represented by the gift of wings and flight.Its
brilliance heralds the pairing-time.Wings and flight there will be
none: the female retains her humble larval form, but she kindles her
blazing beacon.The male, on his side, is fully transformed, changes his shape,
acquires wings and wing-cases; nevertheless, like the female, he
possesses, from the time when he is hatched, the pale lamp of the end
segment.This luminous aspect of the stern is characteristic of the
entire Glow-worm tribe, independently of sex and season.It appears
upon the budding grub and continues throughout life unchanged.And we
must not forget to add that it is visible on the dorsal as well as on
the ventral surface, whereas the two large belts peculiar to the female
shine only under the abdomen.My hand is not so steady nor my sight so good as once they were; but,
as far as they allow me, I consult anatomy for the structure of the
luminous organs.I take a scrap of the epidermis and manage to separate
pretty nearly half of one of the shining belts.On the skin a sort of white-wash lies spread,
formed of a very fine, granular substance.This is certainly the
light-producing matter.To examine this white layer more closely is
beyond the power of my weary eyes.Just beside it is a curious
air-tube, whose short and remarkably wide stem branches suddenly into a
sort of bushy tuft of very delicate ramifications.These creep over the
luminous sheet, or even dip into it.The luminescence, therefore, is controlled by the respiratory organs
and the work produced is an oxidation.The white sheet supplies the
oxidizable matter and the thick air-tube spreading into a tufty bush
distributes the flow of air over it.There remains the question of the
substance whereof this sheet is formed.The first suggestion was
phosphorus, in the chemist's sense of the word.The Glow-worm was
calcined and treated with the violent reagents that bring the simple
substances to light; but no one, so far as I know, has obtained a
satisfactory answer along these lines.Phosphorus seems to play no part
here, in spite of the name of phosphorescence which is sometimes
bestowed upon the Glow-worm's gleam.The answer lies elsewhere, no one
knows where.We are better-informed as regards another question.Has the Glow-worm a
free control of the light which he emits?Can he turn it on or down or
put it out as he pleases?Has he an opaque screen which is drawn over
the flame at will, or is that flame always left exposed?There is no
need for any such mechanism: the insect has something better for its
revolving light.The thick air-tube supplying the light-producing sheet increases the
flow of air and the light is intensified; the same tube, swayed by the
animal's will, slackens or even suspends the passage of air and the
light grows fainter or even goes out.It is, in short, the mechanism of
a lamp which is regulated by the access of air to the wick.Excitement can set the attendant air-duct in motion.We must here
distinguish between two cases: that of the gorgeous scarves, the
exclusive ornament of the female ripe for matrimony, and that of the
modest fairy-lamp on the last segment, which both sexes kindle at any
age.In the second case, the extinction caused by a flurry is sudden
and complete, or nearly so.In my nocturnal hunts for young Glow-worms,
measuring about 5 millimetres long (.195 inch.--Translator's Note.), I
can plainly see the glimmer on the blades of grass; but, should the
least false step disturb a neighbouring twig, the light goes out at
once and the coveted insect becomes invisible.Upon the full-grown
females, lit up with their nuptial scarves, even a violent start has
but a slight effect and often none at all.I fire a gun beside a wire-gauze cage in which I am rearing my
menagerie of females in the open air.The illumination continues, as bright and placid as before.I take a
spray and rain down a slight shower of cold water upon the flock.Not
one of my animals puts out its light; at the very most, there is a
brief pause in the radiance; and then only in some cases.I send a puff
of smoke from my pipe into the cage.There are even some extinctions, but these do not last long.Calm soon returns and the light is renewed as brightly as ever.I take
some of the captives in my fingers, turn and return them, tease them a
little.The illumination continues and is not much diminished, if I do
not press hard with my thumb.At this period, with the pairing close at
hand, the insect is in all the fervour of its passionate splendour, and
nothing short of very serious reasons would make it put out its signals
altogether.All things considered, there is not a doubt but that the Glow-worm
himself manages his lighting apparatus, extinguishing and rekindling it
at will; but there is one point at which the voluntary agency of the
insect is without effect.I detach a strip of the epidermis showing one
of the luminescent sheets and place it in a glass tube, which I close
with a plug of damp wadding, to avoid an over-rapid evaporation.Well,
this scrap of carcass shines away merrily, although not quite as
brilliantly as on the living body.The oxidizable substance, the
luminescent sheet, is in direct communication with the surrounding
atmosphere; the flow of oxygen through an air-tube is not necessary;
and the luminous emission continues to take place, in the same way as
when it is produced by the contact of the air with the real phosphorus
of the chemists.Let us add that, in aerated water, the luminousness
continues as brilliant as in the free air, but that it is extinguished
in water deprived of its air by boiling.No better proof could be found
of what I have already propounded, namely, that the Glow-worm's light
is the effect of a slow oxidation.The light is white, calm and soft to the eyes and suggests a spark
dropped by the full moon.Despite its splendour, it is a very feeble
illuminant.If we move a Glow-worm along a line of print, in perfect
darkness, we can easily make out the letters, one by one, and even
words, when these are not too long; but nothing more is visible beyond
a narrow zone.A lantern of this kind soon tires the reader's patience.Suppose a group of Glow-worms placed almost touching one another.Each
of them sheds its glimmer, which ought, one would think, to light up
its neighbours by reflexion and give us a clear view of each individual
specimen.But not at all: the luminous party is a chaos in which our
eyes are unable to distinguish any definite form at a medium distance.The collective lights confuse the light-bearers into one vague whole.Photography gives us a striking proof of this.I have a score of
females, all at the height of their splendour, in a wire-gauze cage in
the open air.A tuft of thyme forms a grove in the centre of their
establishment.When night comes, my captives clamber to this pinnacle
and strive to show off their luminous charms to the best advantage at
every point of the horizon, thus forming along the twigs marvellous
clusters from which I expected magnificent effects on the
photographer's plates and paper.All that I
obtain is white, shapeless patches, denser here and less dense there
according to the numbers forming the group.There is no picture of the
Glow-worms themselves; not a trace either of the tuft of thyme.For
want of satisfactory light, the glorious firework is represented by a
blurred splash of white on a black ground.The beacons of the female Glow-worms are evidently nuptial signals,
invitations to the pairing; but observe that they are lighted on the
lower surface of the abdomen and face the ground, whereas the summoned
males, whose flights are sudden and uncertain, travel overhead, in the
air, sometimes a great way up.In its normal position, therefore, the
glittering lure is concealed from the eyes of those concerned; it is
covered by the thick bulk of the bride.The lantern ought really to
gleam on the back and not under the belly; otherwise the light is
hidden under a bushel.The anomaly is corrected in a very ingenious fashion, for every female
has her little wiles of coquetry.At nightfall, every evening, my caged
captives make for the tuft of thyme with which I have thoughtfully
furnished the prison and climb to the top of the upper branches, those
most in sight.Here, instead of keeping quiet, as they did at the foot
of the bush just now, they indulge in violent exercises, twist the tip
of their very flexible abdomen, turn it to one side, turn it to the
other, jerk it in every direction.In this way, the searchlight cannot
fail to gleam, at one moment or another, before the eyes of every male
who goes a-wooing in the neighbourhood, whether on the ground or in the
air.It is very like the working of the revolving mirror used in catching
Larks.If stationary, the little contrivance would leave the bird
indifferent; turning and breaking up its light in rapid flashes, it
excites it.While the female Glow-worm has her tricks for summoning her swains, the
male, on his side, is provided with an optical apparatus suited to
catch from afar the least reflection of the calling signal.His
corselet expands into a shield and overlaps his head considerably in
the form of a peaked cap or a shade, the object of which appears to be
to limit the field of vision and concentrate the view upon the luminous
speck to be discerned.Under this arch are the two eyes, which are
relatively enormous, exceedingly convex, shaped like a skull-cap and
contiguous to the extent of leaving only a narrow groove for the
insertion of the antennae.This double eye, occupying almost the whole
face of the insect and contained in the cavern formed by the spreading
peak of the corselet, is a regular Cyclops' eye.At the moment of the pairing the illumination becomes much fainter, is
almost extinguished; all that remains alight is the humble fairy-lamp
of the last segment.This discreet night-light is enough for the
wedding, while, all around, the host of nocturnal insects, lingering
over their respective affairs, murmur the universal marriage-hymn.The round, white eggs are laid, or rather
strewn at random, without the least care on the mother's part, either
on the more or less cool earth or on a blade of grass.These brilliant
ones know nothing at all of family affection.Here is a very singular thing: the Glow-worm's eggs are luminous even
when still contained in the mother's womb.If I happen by accident to
crush a female big with germs that have reached maturity, a shiny
streak runs along my fingers, as though I had broken some vessel filled
with a phosphorescent fluid.The
luminosity comes from the cluster of eggs forced out of the ovary.Besides, as laying-time approaches, the phosphorescence of the eggs is
already made manifest through this clumsy midwifery.A soft opalescent
light shines through the integument of the belly.The young of either sex
have two little rush-lights on the last segment.At the approach of the
severe weather they go down into the ground, but not very far.In my
rearing-jars, which are supplied with fine and very loose earth, they
descend to a depth of three or four inches at most.I dig up a few in
mid-winter.I always find them carrying their faint stern-light.About
the month of April they come up again to the surface, there to continue
and complete their evolution.From start to finish the Glow-worm's life is one great orgy of light.The eggs are luminous; the grubs likewise.The full-grown females are
magnificent lighthouses, the adult males retain the glimmer which the
grubs already possessed.We can understand the object of the feminine
beacon; but of what use is all the rest of the pyrotechnic display?To
my great regret, I cannot tell.It is and will be, for many a day to
come, perhaps for all time, the secret of animal physics, which is
deeper than the physics of the books.THE CABBAGE-CATERPILLAR.The cabbage of our modern kitchen-gardens is a semi-artificial plant,
the produce of our agricultural ingenuity quite as much as of the
niggardly gifts of nature.Spontaneous vegetation supplied us with the
long-stalked, scanty-leaved, ill-smelling wilding, as found, according
to the botanists, on the ocean cliffs.He had need of a rare
inspiration who first showed faith in this rustic clown and proposed to
improve it in his garden-patch.Progressing by infinitesimal degrees, culture wrought miracles.It
began by persuading the wild cabbage to discard its wretched leaves,
beaten by the sea-winds, and to replace them by others, ample and
fleshy and close-fitting.It deprived itself of the joys of light by arranging its leaves in a
large compact head, white and tender.In our day, among the successors
of those first tiny hearts, are some that, by virtue of their massive
bulk, have earned the glorious name of chou quintal, as who should say
a hundredweight of cabbage.Later, man thought of obtaining a generous dish with a thousand little
sprays of the inflorescence.Under the cover of
the central leaves, it gorged with food its sheaves of blossom, its
flower-stalks, its branches and worked the lot into a fleshy
conglomeration.Differently entreated, the plant, economizing in the centre of its
shoot, set a whole family of close-wrapped cabbages ladder-wise on a
tall stem.A multitude of dwarf leaf-buds took the place of the
colossal head.Next comes the turn of the stump, an unprofitable, almost wooden,
thing, which seemed never to have any other purpose than to act as a
support for the plant.But the tricks of gardeners are capable of
everything, so much so that the stalk yields to the grower's
suggestions and becomes fleshy and swells into an ellipse similar to
the turnip, of which it possesses all the merits of corpulence, flavour
and delicacy; only the strange product serves as a base for a few
sparse leaves, the last protests of a real stem that refuses to lose
its attributes entirely.If the stem allows itself to be allured, why not the root?It does, in
fact, yield to the blandishments of agriculture: it dilates its pivot
into a flat turnip, which half emerges from the ground.This is the
rutabaga, or swede, the turnip-cabbage of our northern districts.Incomparably docile under our nursing, the cabbage has given its all
for our nourishment and that of our cattle: its leaves, its flowers,
its buds, its stalk, its root; all that it now wants is to combine the
ornamental with the useful, to smarten itself, to adorn our flowerbeds
and cut a good figure on a drawing-room table.It has done this to
perfection, not with its flowers, which, in their modesty, continue
intractable, but with its curly and variegated leaves, which have the
undulating grace of Ostrich-feathers and the rich colouring of a mixed
bouquet.None who beholds it in this magnificence will recognize the
near relation of the vulgar "greens" that form the basis of our
cabbage-soup.The cabbage, first in order of date in our kitchen-gardens, was held in
high esteem by classic antiquity, next after the bean and, later, the
pea; but it goes much farther back, so far indeed that no memories of
its acquisition remain.History pays but little attention to these
details: it celebrates the battle-fields whereon we meet our death, but
scorns to speak of the ploughed fields whereby we thrive; it knows the
names of the kings' bastards, but cannot tell us the origin of wheat.This silence respecting the precious plants that serve as food is most
regrettable.The cabbage in particular, the venerable cabbage, that
denizen of the most ancient garden-plots, would have had extremely
interesting things to teach us.It is a treasure in itself, but a
treasure twice exploited, first by man and next by the caterpillar of
the Pieris, the common Large White Butterfly whom we all know (Pieris
brassicae, Lin.).This caterpillar feeds indiscriminately on the leaves
of all varieties of cabbage, however dissimilar in appearance: he
nibbles with the same appetite red cabbage and broccoli, curly greens
and savoy, swedes and turnip-tops, in short, all that our ingenuity,
lavish of time and patience, has been able to obtain from the original
plant since the most distant ages.But what did the caterpillar eat before our cabbages supplied him with
copious provender?Obviously the Pieris did not wait for the advent of
man and his horticultural works in order to take part in the joys of
life.She lived without us and would have continued to live without us.A Butterfly's existence is not subject to ours, but rightfully
independent of our aid.Before the white-heart, the cauliflower, the savoy and the others were
invented, the Pieris' caterpillar certainly did not lack food: he
browsed on the wild cabbage of the cliffs, the parent of all the
latter-day wealth; but, as this plant is not widely distributed and is,
in any case, limited to certain maritime regions, the welfare of the
Butterfly, whether on plain or hill, demanded a more luxuriant and more
common plant for pasturage.This plant was apparently one of the
Cruciferae, more or less seasoned with sulpheretted essence, like the
cabbages.I rear the Pieris' caterpillars from the egg upwards on the wall-rocket
(Diplotaxis tenuifolia, Dec.), which imbibes strong spices along the
edge of the paths and at the foot of the walls.Penned in a large
wire-gauze bell-cage, they accept this provender without demur; they
nibble it with the same appetite as if it were cabbage; and they end by
producing chrysalids and Butterflies.The change of fare causes not the
least trouble.I am equally successful with other crucifers of a less marked flavour:
white mustard (Sinapis incana, Lin.), dyer's woad (Isatis tinctoria,
Lin.), wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum, Lin.), whitlow pepperwort
(Lepidium draba, Lin.), hedge-mustard (Sisymbrium officinale, Scop.).On the other hand, the leaves of the lettuce, the bean, the pea, the
corn-salad are obstinately refused.Let us be content with what we have
seen: the fare has been sufficiently varied to show us that the
cabbage-caterpillar feeds exclusively on a large number of crucifers,
perhaps even on all.As these experiments are made in the enclosure of a bell-cage, one
might imagine that captivity impels the flock to feed, in the absence
of better things, on what it would refuse were it free to hunt for
itself.Having naught else within their reach, the starvelings consume
any and all Cruciferae, without distinction of species.Can things
sometimes be the same in the open fields, where I play none of my
tricks?Can the family of the White Butterfly be settled on other
Crucifers than the cabbage?I start a quest along the paths near the
gardens and end by finding on wild radish and white mustard colonies as
crowded and prosperous as those established on cabbage.Now, except when the metamorphosis is at hand, the caterpillar of the
White Butterfly never travels: he does all his growing on the identical
plant whereon he saw the light.The caterpillars observed on the wild
radish, as well as other households, are not, therefore, emigrants who
have come as a matter of fancy from some cabbage-patch in the
neighbourhood: they have hatched on the very leaves where I find them.Hence I arrive at this conclusion: the White Butterfly, who is fitful
in her flight, chooses cabbage first, to dab her eggs upon, and
different Cruciferae next, varying greatly in appearance.How does the Pieris manage to know her way about her botanical domain?We have seen the Larini (A species of Weevils found on
thistle-heads.--Translator's Note.), those explorers of fleshy
receptacles with an artichoke flavour, astonish us with their knowledge
of the flora of the thistle tribe; but their lore might, at a pinch, be
explained by the method followed at the moment of housing the egg.With
their rostrum, they prepare niches and dig out basins in the receptacle
exploited and consequently they taste the thing a little before
entrusting their eggs to it.On the other hand, the Butterfly, a
nectar-drinker, makes not the least enquiry into the savoury qualities
of the leafage; at most dipping her proboscis into the flowers, she
abstracts a mouthful of syrup.This means of investigation, moreover,
would be of no use to her, for the plant selected for the establishing
of her family is, for the most part, not yet in flower.The mother
flits for a moment around the plant; and that swift examination is
enough: the emission of eggs takes place if the provender be found
suitable.The botanist, to recognize a crucifer, requires the indication provided
by the flower.She does not consult the
seed-vessel, to see if it be long or short, nor yet the petals, four in
number and arranged in a cross, because the plant, as a rule, is not in
flower; and still she recognizes offhand what suits her caterpillars,
in spite of profound differences that would embarrass any but a
botanical expert.Unless the Pieris has an innate power of discrimination to guide her,
it is impossible to understand the great extent of her vegetable realm.She needs for her family Cruciferae, nothing but Cruciferae; and she
knows this group of plants to perfection.I have been an enthusiastic
botanist for half a century and more.Nevertheless, to discover if this
or that plant, new to me, is or is not one of the Cruciferae, in the
absence of flowers and fruits I should have more faith in the
Butterfly's statements than in all the learned records of the books.Where science is apt to make mistakes instinct is infallible.The Pieris has two families a year: one in April and May, the other in
September.The cabbage-patches are renewed in those same months.The
Butterfly's calendar tallies with the gardener's: the moment that
provisions are in sight, consumers are forthcoming for the feast.The eggs are a bright orange-yellow and do not lack prettiness when
examined under the lens.They are blunted cones, ranged side by side on
their round base and adorned with finely-scored longitudinal ridges.They are collected in slabs, sometimes on the upper surface, when the
leaf that serves as a support is spread wide, sometimes on the lower
surface when the leaf is pressed to the next ones.Slabs of a couple of hundred are pretty frequent;
isolated eggs, or eggs collected in small groups, are, on the contrary,
rare.The mother's output is affected by the degree of quietness at the
moment of laying.The outer circumference of the group is irregularly formed, but the
inside presents a certain order.The eggs are here arranged in straight
rows backing against one another in such a way that each egg finds a
double support in the preceding row.This alternation, without being of
an irreproachable precision, gives a fairly stable equilibrium to the
whole.To see the mother at her laying is no easy matter: when examined too
closely, the Pieris decamps at once.The structure of the work,
however, reveals the order of the operations pretty clearly.The
ovipositor swings slowly first in this direction, then in that, by
turns; and a new egg is lodged in each space between two adjoining eggs
in the previous row.The extent of the oscillation determines the
length of the row, which is longer or shorter according to the layer's
fancy.The hatching takes place in about a week.It is almost simultaneous for
the whole mass: as soon as one caterpillar comes out of its egg, the
others come out also, as though the natal impulse were communicated
from one to the other.In the same way, in the nest of the Praying
Mantis, a warning seems to be spread abroad, arousing every one of the
population.It is a wave propagated in all directions from the point
first struck.The egg does not open by means of a dehiscence similar to that of the
vegetable-pods whose seeds have attained maturity; it is the new-born
grub itself that contrives an exit-way by gnawing a hole in its
enclosure.In this manner, it obtains near the top of the cone a
symmetrical dormer-window, clean-edged, with no joins nor unevenness of
any kind, showing that this part of the wall has been nibbled away and
swallowed.But for this breach, which is just wide enough for the
deliverance, the egg remains intact, standing firmly on its base.It is
now that the lens is best able to take in its elegant structure.What
it sees is a bag made of ultra-fine gold-beater's skin, translucent,
stiff and white, retaining the complete form of the original egg.A
score of streaked and knotted lines run from the top to the base.It is
the wizard's pointed cap, the mitre with the grooves carved into
jewelled chaplets.All said, the Cabbage-caterpillar's birth-casket is
an exquisite work of art.The hatching of the lot is finished in a couple of hours and the
swarming family musters on the layer of swaddling-clothes, still in the
same position.For a long time, before descending to the fostering
leaf, it lingers on this kind of hot-bed, is even very busy there.It is browsing a strange kind of grass, the handsome mitres
that remain standing on end.Slowly and methodically, from top to base,
the new-born grubs nibble the wallets whence they have just emerged.By
to-morrow, nothing is left of these but a pattern of round dots, the
bases of the vanished sacks.As his first mouthfuls, therefore, the Cabbage-caterpillar eats the
membranous wrapper of his egg.This is a regulation diet, for I have
never seen one of the little grubs allow itself to be tempted by the
adjacent green stuff before finishing the ritual repast whereat skin
bottles furnish forth the feast.It is the first time that I have seen
a larva make a meal of the sack in which it was born.Of what use can
this singular fare be to the budding caterpillar?I suspect as follows:
the leaves of the cabbage are waxed and slippery surfaces and nearly
always slant considerably.To graze on them without risking a fall,
which would be fatal in earliest childhood, is hardly possible unless
with moorings that afford a steady support.What is needed is bits of
silk stretched along the road as fast as progress is made, something
for the legs to grip, something to provide a good anchorage even when
the grub is upside down.The silk-tubes, where those moorings are
manufactured, must be very scantily supplied in a tiny, new-born
animal; and it is expedient that they be filled without delay with the
aid of a special form of nourishment.Then what shall the nature of the
first food be?Vegetable matter, slow to elaborate and niggardly in its
yield, does not fulfil the desired conditions at all well, for time
presses and we must trust ourselves safely to the slippery leaf.An
animal diet would be preferable: it is easier to digest and undergoes
chemical changes in a shorter time.The wrapper of the egg is of a
horny nature, as silk itself is.It will not take long to transform the
one into the other.The grub therefore tackles the remains of its egg
and turns it into silk to carry with it on its first journeys.If my surmise is well-founded, there is reason to believe that, with a
view to speedily filling the silk-glands to which they look to supply
them with ropes, other caterpillars beginning their existence on smooth
and steeply-slanting leaves also take as their first mouthful the
membranous sack which is all that remains of the egg.The whole of the platform of birth-sacks which was the first
camping-ground of the White Butterfly's family is razed to the ground;
naught remains but the round marks of the individual pieces that
composed it.The structure of piles has disappeared; the prints left by
the piles remain.The little caterpillars are now on the level of the
leaf which shall henceforth feed them.They are a pale orange-yellow,
with a sprinkling of white bristles.The head is a shiny black and
remarkably powerful; it already gives signs of the coming gluttony.The
little animal measures scarcely two millimetres in length.(.078
inch.--Translator's Note.)The troop begins its steadying-work as soon as it comes into contact
with its pasturage, the green cabbage-leaf.Here, there, in its
immediate neighbourhood, each grub emits from its spinning glands short
cables so slender that it takes an attentive lens to catch a glimpse of
them.This is enough to ensure the equilibrium of the almost
imponderable atom.The grub's length promptly increases
from two millimetres to four.Soon, a moult takes place which alters
its costume: its skin becomes speckled, on a pale-yellow ground, with a
number of black dots intermingled with white bristles.Three or four
days of rest are necessary after the fatigue of breaking cover.When
this is over, the hunger-fit starts that will make a ruin of the
cabbage within a few weeks.What a stomach, working continuously day and night!It is a devouring laboratory, through which the foodstuffs merely pass,
transformed at once.I serve up to my caged herd a bunch of leaves
picked from among the biggest: two hours later, nothing remains but the
thick midribs; and even these are attacked when there is any delay in
renewing the victuals.At this rate a "hundredweight-cabbage," doled
out leaf by leaf, would not last my menagerie a week.The gluttonous animal, therefore, when it swarms and multiplies, is a
scourge.How are we to protect our gardens against it?In the days of
Pliny, the great Latin naturalist, a stake was set up in the middle of
the cabbage-bed to be preserved; and on this stake was fixed a Horse's
skull bleached in the sun: a Mare's skull was considered even better.This sort of bogey was supposed to ward off the devouring brood.My confidence in this preservative is but an indifferent one; my reason
for mentioning it is that it reminds me of a custom still observed in
our own days, at least in my part of the country.Nothing is so
long-lived as absurdity.Tradition has retained in a simplified form,
the ancient defensive apparatus of which Pliny speaks.For the Horse's
skull our people have substituted an egg-shell on the top of a switch
stuck among the cabbages.It is easier to arrange; also it is quite as
useful, that is to say, it has no effect whatever.Everything, even the nonsensical, is capable of explanation with a
little credulity.When I question the peasants, our neighbours, they
tell me that the effect of the egg-shell is as simple as can be: the
Butterflies, attracted by the whiteness, come and lay their eggs upon
it.Broiled by the sun and lacking all nourishment on that thankless
support, the little caterpillars die; and that makes so many fewer.I insist; I ask them if they have ever seen slabs of eggs or masses of
young caterpillars on those white shells."Never," they reply, with one voice."It was done in the old days and so we go on doing it: that's all we
know; and that's enough for us."I leave it at that, persuaded that the memory of the Horse's skull,
used once upon a time, is ineradicable, like all the rustic absurdities
implanted by the ages.We have, when all is said, but one means of protection, which is to
watch and inspect the cabbage-leaves assiduously and crush the slabs of
eggs between our finger and thumb and the caterpillars with our feet.Nothing is so effective as this method, which makes great demands on
one's time and vigilance.What pains to obtain an unspoilt cabbage!And
what a debt do we not owe to those humble scrapers of the soil, those
ragged heroes, who provide us with the wherewithal to live!To eat and digest, to accumulate reserves whence the Butterfly will
issue: that is the caterpillar's one and only business.The
Cabbage-caterpillar performs it with insatiable gluttony.Incessantly
it browses, incessantly digests: the supreme felicity of an animal
which is little more than an intestine.There is never a distraction,
unless it be certain see-saw movements which are particularly curious
when several caterpillars are grazing side by side, abreast.Then, at
intervals, all the heads in the row are briskly lifted and as briskly
lowered, time after time, with an automatic precision worthy of a
Prussian drill-ground.Can it be their method of intimidating an always
possible aggressor?Can it be a manifestation of gaiety, when the
wanton sun warms their full paunches?Whether sign of fear or sign of
bliss, this is the only exercise that the gluttons allow themselves
until the proper degree of plumpness is attained.After a month's grazing, the voracious appetite of my caged herd is
assuaged.The caterpillars climb the trelliswork in every direction,
walk about anyhow, with their forepart raised and searching space.Here
and there, as they pass, the swaying herd put forth a thread.They
wander restlessly, anxiously to travel afar.The exodus now prevented
by the trellised enclosure I once saw under excellent conditions.At
the advent of the cold weather, I had placed a few cabbage-stalks,
covered with caterpillars, in a small greenhouse.Those who saw the
common kitchen vegetable sumptuously lodged under glass, in the company
of the pelargonium and the Chinese primrose, were astonished at my
curious fancy.I had my plans: I wanted to find out
how the family of the Large White Butterfly behaves when the cold
weather sets in.At the end of
November, the caterpillars, having grown to the desired extent, left
the cabbages, one by one, and began to roam about the walls.None of
them fixed himself there or made preparations for the transformation.I
suspected that they wanted the choice of a spot in the open air,
exposed to all the rigours of winter.I therefore left the door of the
hothouse open.I found them dispersed all over the neighbouring walls, some thirty
yards off.The thrust of a ledge, the eaves formed by a projecting bit
of mortar served them as a shelter where the chrysalid moult took place
and where the winter was passed.The Cabbage-caterpillar possesses a
robust constitution, unsusceptible to torrid heat or icy cold.All that
he needs for his metamorphosis is an airy lodging, free from permanent
damp.The inmates of my fold, therefore, move about for a few days on the
trelliswork, anxious to travel afar in search of a wall.Finding none
and realizing that time presses, they resign themselves.Each one,
supporting himself on the trellis, first weaves around himself a thin
carpet of white silk, which will form the sustaining layer at the time
of the laborious and delicate work of the nymphosis.He fixes his
rear-end to this base by a silk pad and his fore-part by a strap that
passes under his shoulders and is fixed on either side to the carpet.Thus slung from his three fastenings, he strips himself of his larval
apparel and turns into a chrysalis in the open air, with no protection
save that of the wall, which the caterpillar would certainly have found
had I not interfered.Of a surety, he would be short-sighted indeed that pictured a world of
good things prepared exclusively for our advantage.The earth, the
great foster-mother, has a generous breast.At the very moment when
nourishing matter is created, even though it be with our own zealous
aid, she summons to the feast host upon host of consumers, who are all
the more numerous and enterprising in proportion as the table is more
amply spread.The cherry of our orchards is excellent eating: a maggot
contends with us for its possession.In vain do we weigh suns and
planets: our supremacy, which fathoms the universe, cannot prevent a
wretched worm from levying its toll on the delicious fruit.We make
ourselves at home in a cabbage bed: the sons of the Pieris make
themselves at home there too.Preferring broccoli to wild radish, they
profit where we have profited; and we have no remedy against their
competition save caterpillar-raids and egg-crushing, a thankless,
tedious, and none too efficacious work.The Cabbage-caterpillar eagerly
puts forth his own, so much so that the cultivation of the precious
plant would be endangered if others concerned did not take part in its
defence.These others are the auxiliaries (The author employs this word
to denote the insects that are helpful, while describing as "ravagers"
the insects that are hurtful to the farmer's crops.--Translator's
Note.), our helpers from necessity and not from sympathy.The words
friend and foe, auxiliaries and ravagers are here the mere conventions
of a language not always adapted to render the exact truth.He is our
foe who eats or attacks our crops; our friend is he who feeds upon our
foes.Everything is reduced to a frenzied contest of appetites.In the name of the might that is mine, of trickery, of highway robbery,
clear out of that, you, and make room for me: give me your seat at the
banquet!That is the inexorable law in the world of animals and more or
less, alas, in our own world as well!Now, among our entomological auxiliaries, the smallest in size are the
best at their work.One of them is charged with watching over the
cabbages.She is so small, she works so discreetly that the gardener
does not know her, has not even heard of her.Were he to see her by
accident, flitting around the plant which she protects, he would take
no notice of her, would not suspect the service rendered.I propose to
set forth the tiny <DW40>'s deserts.Scientists call her Microgaster glomeratus.What exactly was in the
mind of the author of the name Microgaster, which means little belly?Did he intend to allude to the insignificance of the abdomen?However slight the belly may be, the insect nevertheless possesses one,
correctly proportioned to the rest of the body, so that the classic
denomination, far from giving us any information, might mislead us,
were we to trust it wholly.Nomenclature, which changes from day to day
and becomes more and more cacophonous, is an unsafe guide.Instead of
asking the animal what its name is, let us begin by asking:

"What can you do?Well, the Microgaster's business is to exploit the Cabbage-caterpillar,
a clearly-defined business, admitting of no possible confusion.In the spring, let us inspect the neighbourhood of
the kitchen-garden.Be our eye never so unobservant, we shall notice
against the walls or on the withered grasses at the foot of the hedges
some very small yellow cocoons, heaped into masses the size of a
hazel-nut.Beside each group lies a Cabbage-caterpillar, sometimes dying,
sometimes dead, and always presenting a most tattered appearance.These
cocoons are the work of the Microgaster's family, hatched or on the
point of hatching into the perfect stage; the caterpillar is the dish
whereon that family has fed during its larval state.The epithet
glomeratus, which accompanies the name of Microgaster, suggests this
conglomeration of cocoons.Let us collect the clusters as they are,
without seeking to separate them, an operation which would demand both
patience and dexterity, for the cocoons are closely united by the
inextricable tangle of their surface-threads.In May a swarm of pigmies
will sally forth, ready to get to business in the cabbages.Colloquial language uses the terms Midge and Gnat to describe the tiny
insects which we often see dancing in a ray of sunlight.There is
something of everything in those aerial ballets.It is possible that
the persecutrix of the Cabbage-caterpillar is there, along with many
another; but the name of Midge cannot properly be applied to her.He
who says Midge says Fly, Dipteron, two-winged insect; and our friend
has four wings, one and all adapted for flying.By virtue of this
characteristic and others no less important, she belongs to the order
of Hymenoptera.(This order includes the Ichneumon-flies, of whom the
Microgaster is one.--Translator's Note.)No matter: as our language
possesses no more precise term outside the scientific vocabulary, let
us use the expression Midge, which pretty well conveys the general
idea.Our Midge, the Microgaster, is the size of an average Gnat.She
measures 3 or 4 millimetres.(.117 to.156 inch.--Translator's Note.)The two sexes are equally numerous and wear the same costume, a black
uniform, all but the legs, which are pale red.In spite of this
likeness, they are easily distinguished.The male has an abdomen which
is slightly flattened and, moreover, curved at the tip; the female,
before the laying, has hers full and perceptibly distended by its
ovular contents.This rapid sketch of the insect should be enough for
our purpose.If we wish to know the grub and especially to inform ourselves of its
manner of living, it is advisable to rear in a cage a numerous herd of
Cabbage-caterpillars.Whereas a direct search on the cabbages in our
garden would give us but a difficult and uncertain harvest, by this
means we shall daily have as many as we wish before our eyes.In the course of June, which is the time when the caterpillars quit
their pastures and go far afield to settle on some wall or other, those
in my fold, finding nothing better, climb to the dome of the cage to
make their preparations and to spin a supporting network for the
chrysalid's needs.Among these spinners we see some weaklings working
listlessly at their carpet.Their appearance makes us deem them in the
grip of a mortal disease.I take a few of them and open their bellies,
using a needle by way of a scalpel.What comes out is a bunch of green
entrails, soaked in a bright yellow fluid, which is really the
creature's blood.These tangled intestines swarm with little lazy
grubs, varying greatly in number, from ten or twenty at least to
sometimes half a hundred.They are the offspring of the Microgaster.The lens makes conscientious enquiries; nowhere
does it manage to show me the vermin attacking solid nourishment, fatty
tissues, muscles or other parts; nowhere do I see them bite, gnaw, or
dissect.The following experiment will tell us more fully: I pour into
a watch-glass the crowds extracted from the hospitable paunches.I
flood them with caterpillar's blood obtained by simple pricks; I place
the preparation under a glass bell-jar, in a moist atmosphere, to
prevent evaporation; I repeat the nourishing bath by means of fresh
bleedings and give them the stimulant which they would have gained from
the living caterpillar.Thanks to these precautions, my charges have
all the appearance of excellent health; they drink and thrive.But this
state of things cannot last long.Soon ripe for the transformation, my
grubs leave the dining-room of the watch-glass as they would have left
the caterpillar's belly; they come to the ground to try and weave their
tiny cocoons.They have missed a
suitable support, that is to say, the silky carpet provided by the
dying caterpillar.No matter: I have seen enough to convince me.The
larvae of the Microgaster do not eat in the strict sense of the word;
they live on soup; and that soup is the caterpillar's blood.Examine the parasites closely and you shall see that their diet is
bound to be a liquid one.They are little white grubs, neatly
segmented, with a pointed forepart splashed with tiny black marks, as
though the atom had been slaking its thirst in a drop of ink.It moves
its hind-quarters slowly, without shifting its position.The mouth is a pore, devoid of any apparatus for
disintegration-work: it has no fangs, no horny nippers, no mandibles;
its attack is just a kiss.It does not chew, it sucks, it takes
discreet sips at the moisture all around it.The fact that it refrains entirely from biting is confirmed by my
autopsy of the stricken caterpillars.In the patient's belly,
notwithstanding the number of nurselings who hardly leave room for the
nurse's entrails, everything is in perfect order; nowhere do we see a
trace of mutilation.Nor does aught on the outside betray any havoc
within.The exploited caterpillars graze and move about peacefully,
giving no sign of pain.It is impossible for me to distinguish them
from the unscathed ones in respect of appetite and untroubled
digestion.When the time approaches to weave the carpet for the support of the
chrysalis, an appearance of emaciation at last points to the evil that
is at their vitals.They are stoics who do not
forget their duty in the hour of death.At last they expire, quite
softly, not of any wounds, but of anaemia, even as a lamp goes out when
the oil comes to an end.The living caterpillar,
capable of feeding himself and forming blood, is a necessity for the
welfare of the grubs; he has to last about a month, until the
Microgaster's offspring have achieved their full growth.The two
calendars synchronize in a remarkable way.When the caterpillar leaves
off eating and makes his preparations for the metamorphosis, the
parasites are ripe for the exodus.The bottle dries up when the
drinkers cease to need it; but until that moment it must remain more or
less well-filled, although becoming limper daily.It is important,
therefore, that the caterpillar's existence be not endangered by wounds
which, even though very tiny, would stop the working of the
blood-fountains.With this intent, the drainers of the bottle are, in a
manner of speaking, muzzled; they have by way of a mouth a pore that
sucks without bruising.The dying caterpillar continues to lay the silk of his carpet with a
slow oscillation of the head.The moment now comes for the parasites to
emerge.This happens in June and generally at nightfall.A breach is
made on the ventral surface or else in the sides, never on the back:
one breach only, contrived at a point of minor resistance, at the
junction of two segments; for it is bound to be a toilsome business, in
the absence of a set of filing-tools.Perhaps the grubs take one
another's places at the point attacked and come by turns to work at it
with a kiss.In one short spell, the whole tribe issues through this single opening
and is soon wriggling about, perched on the surface of the caterpillar.The lens cannot perceive the hole, which closes on the instant.There
is not even a haemorrhage: the bottle has been drained too thoroughly.You must press it between your fingers to squeeze out a few drops of
moisture and thus discover the place of exit.Around the caterpillar, who is not always quite dead and who sometimes
even goes on weaving his carpet a moment longer, the vermin at once
begin to work at their cocoons.The straw- thread, drawn from
the silk-glands by a backward jerk of the head, is first fixed to the
white network of the caterpillar and then produces adjacent warp-beams,
so that, by mutual entanglements, the individual works are welded
together and form an agglomeration in which each of the grubs has its
own cabin.For the moment, what is woven is not the real cocoon, but a
general scaffolding which will facilitate the construction of the
separate shells.All these frames rest upon those adjoining and, mixing
up their threads, become a common edifice wherein each grub contrives a
shelter for itself.Here at last the real cocoon is spun, a pretty
little piece of closely-woven work.In my rearing-jars I obtain as many groups of these tiny shells as my
future experiments can wish for.Three-fourths of the caterpillars have
supplied me with them, so ruthless has been the toll of the spring
births.I lodge these groups, one by one, in separate glass tubes, thus
forming a collection on which I can draw at will, while, in view of my
experiments, I keep under observation the whole swarm produced by one
caterpillar.The adult Microgaster appears a fortnight later, in the middle of June.The riotous multitude is in
the full enjoyment of the pairing-season, for the two sexes always
figure among the guests of any one caterpillar.The carnival of these pigmies bewilders the observer and
makes his head swim.Most of the females, wishful of liberty, plunge down to the waist
between the glass of the tube and the plug of cotton-wool that closes
the end turned to the light; but the lower halves remain free and form
a circular gallery in front of which the males hustle one another, take
one another's places and hastily operate.Each bides his turn, each
attends to his little matters for a few moments and then makes way for
his rivals and goes off to start again elsewhere.The turbulent wedding
lasts all the morning and begins afresh next day, a mighty throng of
couples embracing, separating and embracing once more.There is every reason to believe that, in gardens, the mated ones,
finding themselves in isolated couples, would keep quieter.Here, in
the tube, things degenerate into a riot because the assembly is too
numerous for the narrow space.Apparently a little food, a
few sugary mouthfuls extracted from the flowers.I serve up some
provisions in the tubes: not drops of honey, in which the puny
creatures would get stuck, but little strips of paper spread with that
dainty.They come to them, take their stand on them and refresh
themselves.With this diet,
renewed as the strips dry up, I can keep them in very good condition
until the end of my inquisition.The colonists in my spare
tubes are restless and quick of flight; they will have to be
transferred presently to sundry vessels without my risking the loss of
a good number, or even the whole lot, a loss which my hands, my forceps
and other means of coercion would be unable to prevent by checking the
nimble movements of the tiny prisoners.The irresistible attraction of
the sunlight comes to my aid.If I lay one of my tubes horizontally on
the table, turning one end towards the full light of a sunny window,
the captives at once make for the brighter end and play about there for
a long while, without seeking to retreat.If I turn the tube in the
opposite direction, the crowd immediately shifts its quarters and
collects at the other end.With this bait, I can send it whithersoever I please.We will therefore place the new receptacle, jar or test-tube, on the
table, pointing the closed end towards the window.At its mouth, we
open one of the full tubes.No other precaution is needed: even though
the mouth leaves a large interval free, the swarm hastens into the
lighted chamber.All that remains to be done is to close the apparatus
before moving it.The observer is now in control of the multitude,
without appreciable losses, and is able to question it at will.We will begin by asking:

"How do you manage to lodge your germs inside the caterpillar?"This question and others of the same category, which ought to take
precedence of everything else, are generally neglected by the impaler
of insects, who cares more for the niceties of nomenclature than for
glorious realities.He classifies his subjects, dividing them into
regiments with barbarous labels, a work which seems to him the highest
expression of entomological science.Names, nothing but names: the rest
hardly counts.The persecutor of the Pieris used to be called
Microgaster, that is to say, little belly: to-day she is called
Apanteles, that is to say, the incomplete.Can our friend at least tell us how "the Little Belly" or "the
Incomplete" gets into the caterpillar?A book which,
judging by its recent date, should be the faithful echo of our actual
knowledge, informs us that the Microgaster inserts her eggs direct into
the caterpillar's body.It goes on to say that the parasitic vermin
inhabit the chrysalis, whence they make their way out by perforating
the stout horny wrapper.Hundreds of times have I witnessed the exodus
of the grubs ripe for weaving their cocoons; and the exit has always
been made through the skin of the caterpillar and never through the
armour of the chrysalis.The fact that its mouth is a mere clinging
pore, deprived of any offensive weapon, would even lead me to believe
that the grub is incapable of perforating the chrysalid's covering.This proved error makes me doubt the other proposition, though logical,
after all, and agreeing with the methods followed by a host of
parasites.No matter: my faith in what I read in print is of the
slightest; I prefer to go straight to facts.Before making a statement
of any kind, I want to see, what I call seeing.It is a slower and more
laborious process; but it is certainly much safer.I will not undertake to lie in wait for what takes place on the
cabbages in the garden: that method is too uncertain and besides does
not lend itself to precise observation.As I have in hand the necessary
materials, to wit, my collection of tubes swarming with the parasites
newly hatched into the adult form, I will operate on the little table
in my animals' laboratory.A jar with a capacity of about a litre
(About 1 3/4 pints, or.22 gallon.--Translator's Note.)is placed on
the table, with the bottom turned towards the window in the sun.I put
into it a cabbage-leaf covered with caterpillars, sometimes fully
developed, sometimes half-way, sometimes just out of the egg.A strip
of honeyed paper will serve the Microgaster as a dining room, if the
experiment is destined to take some time.Lastly, by the method of
transfer which I described above, I send the inmates of one of my tubes
into the apparatus.Once the jar is closed, there is nothing left to do
but to let things take their course and to keep an assiduous watch, for
days and weeks, if need be.The caterpillars graze placidly, heedless of their terrible attendants.If some giddy-pates in the turbulent swarm pass over the caterpillars'
spines, these draw up their fore-part with a jerk and as suddenly lower
it again; and that is all: the intruders forthwith decamp.Nor do the
latter seem to contemplate any harm: they refresh themselves on the
honey-smeared strip, they come and go tumultuously.Their short flights
may land them, now in one place, now in another, on the browsing herd,
but they pay no attention to it.What we see is casual meetings, not
deliberate encounters.In vain I change the flock of caterpillars and vary their age; in vain
I change the squad of parasites; in vain I follow events in the jar for
long hours, morning and evening, both in a dim light and in the full
glare of the sun: I succeed in seeing nothing, absolutely nothing, on
the parasite's side, that resembles an attack.No matter what the
ill-informed authors say--ill-informed because they had not the
patience to see for themselves--the conclusion at which I arrive is
positive: to inject the germs, the Microgaster never attacks the
caterpillars.The invasion, therefore, is necessarily effected through the
Butterfly's eggs themselves, as experiment will prove.My broad jar
would tell against the inspection of the troop, kept at too great a
distance by the glass enclosure, and I therefore select a tube an inch
wide.I place in this a shred of cabbage-leaf, bearing a slab of eggs,
as laid by the Butterfly.I next introduce the inmates of one of my
spare vessels.A strip of paper smeared with honey accompanies the new
arrivals.Soon, the females are there, fussing about,
sometimes to the extent of blackening the whole slab of yellow eggs.They inspect the treasure, flutter their wings and brush their
hind-legs against each other, a sign of keen satisfaction.They sound
the heap, probe the interstices with their antennae and tap the
individual eggs with their palpi; then, this one here, that one there,
they quickly apply the tip of their abdomen to the egg selected.Each
time, we see a slender, horny prickle darting from the ventral surface,
close to the end.This is the instrument that deposits the germ under
the film of the egg; it is the inoculation-needle.The operation is
performed calmly and methodically, even when several mothers are
working at one and the same time.Where one has been, a second goes,
followed by a third, a fourth and others yet, nor am I able definitely
to see the end of the visits paid to the same egg.Each time, the
needle enters and inserts a germ.It is impossible, in such a crowd, for the eye to follow the successive
mothers who hasten to lay in each; but there is one quite practicable
method by which we can estimate the number of germs introduced into a
single egg, which is, later, to open the ravaged caterpillars and count
the grubs which they contain.A less repugnant means is to number the
little cocoons heaped up around each dead caterpillar.The total will
tell us how many germs were injected, some by the same mother returning
several times to the egg already treated, others by different mothers.Well, the number of these cocoons varies greatly.Generally, it
fluctuates in the neighbourhood of twenty, but I have come across as
many as sixty-five; and nothing tells me that this is the extreme
limit.What hideous industry for the extermination of a Butterfly's
progeny!I am fortunate at this moment in having a highly-cultured visitor,
versed in the profundities of philosophic thought.I make way for him
before the apparatus wherein the Microgaster is at work.For an hour
and more, standing lens in hand, he, in his turn, looks and sees what I
have just seen; he watches the layers who go from one egg to the other,
make their choice, draw their slender lancet and prick what the stream
of passers-by, one after the other, have already pricked.Thoughtful
and a little uneasy, he puts down his lens at last.Never had he been
vouchsafed so clear a glimpse as here, in my finger-wide tube, of the
masterly brigandage that runs through all life down to that of the very
smallest.Apanteles, see Microgaster glomeratus.Arundo donax, the great reed.Burying-beetles: method of burial.Cabbage Butterfly, her selection of suitable Cruciferae.Calliphora vomitaria, see Bluebottle.Cetonia, or Rose-chafer.Clairville on the Burying-beetle.Cruciferae, the diet of Pieris brassicae.Epeira, Angular, telegraph wire of.nest of E. pomiformis.prey found in nest of E.

/It/ is an acknowledged fact, that we perceive errors in the works of
others more readily than in our own.A painter, therefore, ought to
be well instructed in perspective, and acquire a perfect knowledge of
the dimensions of the human body; he should also be a good architect,
at least as far as concerns the outward shape of buildings, with their
different parts; and where he is deficient, he ought not to neglect
taking drawings from Nature.It will be well also to have a looking-glass by him, when he paints,
to look often at his work in it, which being seen the contrary way,
will appear as the work of another hand, and will better shew his
faults.It will be useful also to quit his work often, and take some
relaxation, that his judgment may be clearer at his return; for too
great application and sitting still is sometimes the cause of many
gross errors.CCCLVI./--_Of correcting Errors which you discover._


/Remember/, that when, by the exercise of your own judgment, or the
observation of others, you discover any errors in your work, you
immediately set about correcting them, lest, in exposing your works to
the public, you expose your defects also.Admit not any self-excuse,
by persuading yourself that you shall retrieve your character, and
that by some succeeding work you shall make amends for your shameful
negligence; for your work does not perish as soon as it is out of your
hands, like the sound of music, but remains a standing monument of your
ignorance.If you excuse yourself by saying that you have not time for
the study necessary to form a great painter, having to struggle against
necessity, you yourself are only to blame; for the study of what is
excellent is food both for mind and body.How many philosophers, born
to great riches, have given them away, that they might not be retarded
in their pursuits!CCCLVII./--_The best Place for looking at a Picture._


/Let/ us suppose, that A B is the picture, receiving the light from D;
I say, that whoever is placed between C and E, will see the picture
very badly, particularly if it be painted in oil, or varnished; because
it will shine, and will appear almost of the nature of a looking-glass.For these reasons, the nearer you go towards C, the less you will be
able to see, because of the light from the window upon the picture,
sending its reflection to that point.But if you place yourself between
E D, you may conveniently see the picture, and the more so as you draw
nearer to the point D, because that place is less liable to be struck
by the reflected rays.[Illustration]




/Chap.CCCLVIII./--_Of Judgment._


/There/ is nothing more apt to deceive us than our own judgment, in
deciding on our own works; and we should derive more advantage from
having our faults pointed out by our enemies, than by hearing the
opinions of our friends, because they are too much like ourselves, and
may deceive us as much as our own judgment.CCCLIX./--_Of Employment anxiously wished for by Painters._


/And/ you, painter, who are desirous of great practice, understand,
that if you do not rest it on the good foundation of Nature, you will
labour with little honour and less profit; and if you do it on a good
ground your works will be many and good, to your great honour and
advantage.CCCLX./--_Advice to Painters._


/A painter/ ought to study universal Nature, and reason much within
himself on all he sees, making use of the most excellent parts that
compose the species of every object before him.His mind will by this
method be like a mirror, reflecting truly every object placed before
it, and become, as it were, a second Nature.CCCLXI./--_Of Statuary._


/To/ execute a figure in marble, you must first make a model of it in
clay, or plaster, and when it is finished, place it in a square case,
equally capable of receiving the block of marble intended to be shaped
like it.Have some peg-like sticks to pass through holes made in the
sides, and all round the case; push them in till every one touches the
model, marking what remains of the sticks outwards with ink, and making
a countermark to every stick and its hole, so that you may at pleasure
replace them again.Then having taken out the model, and placed the
block of marble in its stead, take so much out of it, till all the pegs
go in at the same holes to the marks you had made.To facilitate the
work, contrive your frame so that every part of it, separately, or all
together, may be lifted up, except the bottom, which must remain under
the marble.By this method you may chop it off with great facility[101].CCCLXII./--_On the Measurement and Division of Statues into
Parts._


/Divide/ the head into twelve parts, each part into twelve degrees,
each degree into twelve minutes, and these minutes into seconds[102].CCCLXIII./--_A Precept for the Painter._


/The/ painter who entertains no doubt of his own ability, will attain
very little.When the work succeeds beyond the judgment, the artist
acquires nothing; but when the judgment is superior to the work, he
never ceases improving, if the love of gain do not <DW44> his progress.CCCLXIV./--_On the Judgment of Painters._


/When/ the work is equal to the knowledge and judgment of the painter,
it is a bad sign; and when it surpasses the judgment, it is still
worse, as is the case with those who wonder at having succeeded so
well.But when the judgment surpasses the work, it is a perfectly good
sign; and the young painter who possesses that rare disposition, will,
no doubt, arrive at great perfection.He will produce few works, but
they will be such as to fix the admiration of every beholder.CCCLXV./--_That a Man ought not to trust to himself, but ought
to consult Nature._


/Whoever/ flatters himself that he can retain in his memory all the
effects of Nature, is deceived, for our memory is not so capacious;
therefore consult Nature for every thing.BOOKS

and supposed to require, that the student should be a deep proficient
in perspective, before he commences the study of painting; but it is
a knowledge of the leading principles only of perspective that the
author here means, and without such a knowledge, which is easily to be
acquired, the student will inevitably fall into errors, as gross as
those humorously pointed out by Hogarth, in his Frontispiece to Kirby's
Perspective.][Footnote 3: Not to be found in this work.][Footnote 4: From this, and many other similar passages, it is evident,
that the author intended at some future time to arrange his manuscript
collections, and to publish them as separate treatises.That he did not
do so is well known; but it is also a fact, that, in selecting from the
whole mass of his collections the chapters of which the present work
consists, great care appears in general to have been taken to extract
also those to which there was any reference from any of the chapters
intended for this work, or which from their subject were necessarily
connected with them.Accordingly, the reader will find, in the notes
to this translation, that all such chapters in any other part of the
present work are uniformly pointed out, as have any relation to the
respective passages in the text.This, which has never before been
done, though indispensably necessary, will be found of singular use,
and it was thought proper here, once for all, to notice it.In the present instance the chapters, referring to the subject in the
text, are Chap.; and though these
do not afford complete information, yet it is to be remembered, that
drawing from relievos is subject to the very same rules as drawing from
Nature; and that, therefore, what is elsewhere said on that subject is
also equally applicable to this.][Footnote 5: The meaning of this is, that the last touches of light,
such as the shining parts (which are always narrow), must be given
sparingly.In short, that the drawing must be kept in broad masses as
much as possible.][Footnote 6: This is not an absolute rule, but it is a very good one
for drawing of portraits.][Footnote 9: See the two preceding chapters.][Footnote 10: Man being the highest of the animal creation, ought to be
the chief object of study.][Footnote 11: An intended Treatise, as it seems, on Anatomy, which
however never was published; but there are several chapters in the
present work on the subject of Anatomy, most of which will be found
under the present head of Anatomy; and of such as could not be placed
there, because they also related to some other branch, the following
is a list by which they may be found: Chapters vi.[Footnote 13: It does not appear that this intention was ever carried
into execution; but there are many chapters in this work on the subject
of motion, where all that is necessary for a painter in this branch
will be found.][Footnote 14: Anatomists have divided this muscle into four or five
sections; but painters, following the ancient sculptors, shew only
the three principal ones; and, in fact, we find that a greater number
of them (as may often be observed in nature) gives a disagreeable
meagreness to the subject.Beautiful nature does not shew more than
three, though there may be more hid under the skin.][Footnote 15: A treatise on weights, like many others, intended by this
author, but never published.][Footnote 17: It is believed that this treatise, like many others
promised by the author, was never written; and to save the necessity of
frequently repeating this fact, the reader is here informed, once for
all, that in the life of the author prefixed to this edition, will be
found an account of the works promised or projected by him, and how far
his intentions have been carried into effect.][Footnote 19: See in this work from chap.[Footnote 22: The author here means to compare the different quickness
of the motion of the head and the heel, when employed in the same
action of jumping; and he states the proportion of the former to be
three times that of the latter.The reason he gives for this is in
substance, that as the head has but one motion to make, while in fact
the lower part of the figure has three successive operations to perform
at the places he mentions, three times the velocity, or, in other
words, three times the degree of effort, is necessary in the head, the
prime mover, to give the power of influencing the other parts; and
the rule deducible from this axiom is, that where two different parts
of the body concur in the same action, and one of them has to perform
one motion only, while the other is to have several, the proportion of
velocity or effort in the former must be regulated by the number of
operations necessary in the latter.][Footnote 23: It is explained in this work, or at least there is
something respecting it in the preceding chapter, and in chap.[Footnote 24: The eyeball moving up and down to look at the hand,
describes a part of a circle, from every point of which it sees it
in an infinite variety of aspects.The hand also is moveable _ad
infinitum_ (for it can go round the whole circle--see chap.),
and consequently shew itself in an infinite variety of aspects, which
it is impossible for any memory to retain.][Footnote 26: About thirteen yards of our measure, the Florentine
braccia, or cubit, by which the author measures, being 1 foot 10 inches
7-8ths English measure.][Footnote 28: It is supposed that the figures are to appear of the
natural size, and not bigger.In that case, the measure of the first,
to be of the exact dimension, should have its feet resting upon the
bottom line; but as you remove it from that, it should diminish.No allusion is here intended to the distance at which a picture is to
be placed from the eye.][Footnote 29: The author does not mean here to say, that one historical
picture cannot be hung over another.It certainly may, because, in
viewing each, the spectator is at liberty (especially if they are
subjects independent of each other) to shift his place so as to stand
at the true point of sight for viewing every one of them; but in
covering a wall with a succession of subjects from the same history,
the author considers the whole as, in fact, but one picture, divided
into compartments, and to be seen at one view, and which cannot
therefore admit more than one point of sight.In the former case, the
pictures are in fact so many distinct subjects unconnected with each
other.]This chapter is obscure, and may probably be made clear by merely
stating it in other words.Leonardo objects to the use of both eyes,
because, in viewing in that manner the objects here mentioned, two
balls, one behind the other, the second is seen, which would not be
the case, if the angle of the visual rays were not too big for the
first object.Whoever is at all acquainted with optics, need not be
told, that the visual rays commence in a single point in the centre, or
nearly the centre of each eye, and continue diverging.But, in using
both eyes, the visual rays proceed not from one and the same centre,
but from a different centre in each eye, and intersecting each other,
as they do a little before passing the first object, they become
together broader than the extent of the first object, and consequently
give a view of part of the second.On the contrary, in using but one
eye, the visual rays proceed but from one centre; and as, therefore,
there cannot be any intersection, the visual rays, when they reach the
first object, are not broader than the first object, and the second is
completely hidden.Properly speaking, therefore, in using both eyes we
introduce more than one point of sight, which renders the perspective
false in the painting; but in using one eye only, there can be, as
there ought, but one point of sight.There is, however, this difference
between viewing real objects and those represented in painting, that in
looking at the former, whether we use one or both eyes, the objects,
by being actually detached from the back ground, admit the visual rays
to strike on them, so as to form a correct perspective, from whatever
point they are viewed, and the eye accordingly forms a perspective of
its own; but in viewing the latter, there is no possibility of varying
the perspective; and, unless the picture is seen precisely under the
same angle as it was painted under, the perspective in all other views
must be false.This is observable in the perspective views painted for
scenes at the playhouse.If the beholder is seated in the central line
of the house, whether in the boxes or pit, the perspective is correct;
but, in proportion as he is placed at a greater or less distance to the
right or left of that line, the perspective appears to him more or less
faulty.And hence arises the necessity of using but one eye in viewing
a painting, in order thereby to reduce it to one point of sight.][Footnote 32: See the Life of the Author prefixed, and chap.[Footnote 33: The author here speaks of unpolished Nature; and indeed
it is from such subjects only, that the genuine and characteristic
operations of Nature are to be learnt.It is the effect of education
to correct the natural peculiarities and defects, and, by so doing, to
assimilate one person to the rest of the world.][Footnote 36: See chapter cclxvii.][Footnote 37: Sir Joshua Reynolds frequently inculcated these precepts
in his lectures, and indeed they cannot be too often enforced.][Footnote 38: Probably this would have formed a part of his intended
Treatise on Light and Shadow, but no such proposition occurs in the
present work.][Footnote 41: This cannot be taken as an absolute rule; it must be left
in a great measure to the judgment of the painter.For much graceful
softness and grandeur is acquired, sometimes, by blending the lights of
the figures with the light part of the ground; and so of the shadows;
as Leonardo himself has observed in chapters cxciv.and Sir
Joshua Reynolds has often put in practice with success.][Footnote 44: He means here to say, that in proportion as the body
interposed between the eye and the object is more or less transparent,
the greater or less quantity of the colour of the body interposed will
be communicated to the object.][Footnote 45: See the note to chap.[Footnote 46: See the preceding chapter, and chap.[Footnote 47: The appearance of motion is lessened according to the
distance, in the same proportion as objects diminish in size.][Footnote 50: This was intended to constitute a part of some book of
Perspective, which we have not; but the rule here referred to will be
found in chap.[Footnote 52: No such work was ever published, nor, for any thing that
appears, ever written.][Footnote 53: The French translation of 1716 has a note on this
chapter, saying, that the invention of enamel painting found out since
the time of Leonardo da Vinci, would better answer to the title of this
chapter, and also be a better method of painting.I must beg leave,
however, to dissent from this opinion, as the two kinds of painting
are so different, that they cannot be compared.Leonardo treats of oil
painting, but the other is vitrification.Leonardo is known to have
spent a great deal of time in experiments, of which this is a specimen,
and it may appear ridiculous to the practitioners of more modern
date, as he does not enter more fully into a minute description of
the materials, or the mode of employing them.The principle laid down
in the text appears to me to be simply this: to make the oil entirely
evaporate from the colours by the action of fire, and afterwards to
prevent the action of the air by the means of a glass, which in itself
is an excellent principle, but not applicable, any more than enamel
painting to large works.][Footnote 54: It is evident that distemper or size painting is here
meant.][Footnote 56: This rule is not without exception: see chap.[Footnote 59: See chapters ccxlvii.Probably they were intended to form a part of a distinct treatise, and
to have been ranged as propositions in that, but at present they are
not so placed.][Footnote 62: Although the author seems to have designed that this, and
many other propositions to which he refers, should have formed a part
of some regular work, and he has accordingly referred to them whenever
he has mentioned them, by their intended numerical situation in that
work, whatever it might be, it does not appear that he ever carried
this design into execution.There are, however, several chapters in
the present work, viz.in which the
principle in the text is recognised, and which probably would have been
transferred into the projected treatise, if he had ever drawn it up.][Footnote 63: The note on the preceding chapter is in a great measure
applicable to this, and the proposition mentioned in the text is also
to be found in chapter ccxlvii.[Footnote 64: See the note on the chapter next but one preceding.The
proposition in the text occurs in chap.[Footnote 66: I do not know a better comment on this passage than
Felibien's Examination of Le Brun's Picture of the Tent of Darius.From this (which has been reprinted with an English translation, by
Colonel Parsons in 1700, in folio) it will clearly appear, what the
chain of connexion is between every colour there used, and its nearest
neighbour, and consequently a rule may be formed from it with more
certainty and precision than where the student is left to develope
it for himself, from the mere inspection of different examples of
colouring.]We have before remarked, that the propositions so
frequently referred to by the author, were never reduced into form,
though apparently he intended a regular work in which they were to be
included.][Footnote 68: No where in this work.][Footnote 69: This is evident in many of Vandyke's portraits,
particularly of ladies, many of whom are dressed in black velvet; and
this remark will in some measure account for the delicate fairness
which he frequently gives to the female complexion.][Footnote 70: These propositions, any more than the others mentioned
in different parts of this work, were never digested into a regular
treatise, as was evidently intended by the author, and consequently are
not to be found, except perhaps in some of the volumes of the author's
manuscript collections.][Footnote 73: This book on perspective was never drawn up.][Footnote 76: There is no work of this author to which this can at
present refer, but the principle is laid down in chapters cclxxxiv.[Footnote 77: See chapters cccvii.[Footnote 80: To our obtaining a correct idea of the magnitude and
distance of any object seen from afar, it is necessary that we consider
how much of distinctness an object loses at a distance (from the mere
interposition of the air), as well as what it loses in size; and these
two considerations must unite before we can decidedly pronounce as to
its distance or magnitude.This calculation, as to distinctness, must
be made upon the idea that the air is clear, as, if by any accident it
is otherwise, we shall (knowing the proportion in which clear air dims
a prospect) be led to conclude this farther off than it is, and, to
justify that conclusion, shall suppose its real magnitude correspondent
with the distance, at which from its degree of distinctness it appears
to be.In the circumstance remarked in the text there is, however, a
great deception; the fact is, that the colour and the minute parts of
the object are lost in the fog, while the size of it is not diminished
in proportion; and the eye being accustomed to see objects diminished
in size at a great distance, supposes this to be farther off than it
is, and consequently imagines it larger.][Footnote 81: This proposition, though undoubtedly intended to form a
part of some future work, which never was drawn up, makes no part of
the present.][Footnote 84: See chapter ccxcviii.][Footnote 85: This was probably to have been a part of some other work,
but it does not occur in this.][Footnote 86: Cento braccia, or cubits.The Florence braccio is one
foot ten inches seven eighths, English measure.][Footnote 87: Probably the Author here means yellow lilies, or fleurs
de lis.][Footnote 88: That point is always found in the horizon, and is called
the point of sight, or the vanishing point.][Footnote 91: This position has been already laid down in chapter
cxxiv.(and will also be found in chapter cccxlviii.); and the reader
is referred to the note on that passage, which will also explain that
in the text, for further illustration.It may, however, be proper to
remark, that though the author has here supposed both objects conveyed
to the eye by an angle of the same extent, they cannot, in fact, be so
seen, unless one eye be shut; and the reason is this: if viewed with
both eyes, there will be two points of sight, one in the centre of each
eye; and the rays from each of these to the objects must of course be
different, and will consequently form different angles.][Footnote 92: The braccio is one foot ten inches and seven eighths
English measure.]To be abridged according to the rules of
perspective.][Footnote 95: The whole of this chapter, like the next but one
preceding, depends on the circumstance of there being in fact two
points of sight, one in the centre of each eye, when an object is
viewed with both eyes.In natural objects the effect which this
circumstance produces is, that the rays from each point of sight,
diverging as they extend towards the object, take in not only that, but
some part also of the distance behind it, till at length, at a certain
distance behind it, they cross each other; whereas, in a painted
representation, there being no real distance behind the object, but the
whole being a flat surface, it is impossible that the rays from the
points of sight should pass beyond that flat surface; and as the object
itself is on that flat surface, which is the real extremity of the
view, the eyes cannot acquire a sight of any thing beyond.][Footnote 96: A well-known painter at Florence, contemporary with
Leonardo da Vinci, who painted several altar-pieces and other public
works.][Footnote 100: Leonardo da Vinci was remarkably fond of this kind of
invention, and is accused of having lost a great deal of time that way.][Footnote 101: The method here recommended, was the general and common
practice at that time, and continued so with little, if any variation,
till lately.But about thirty years ago, the late Mr.Bacon invented
an entirely new method, which, as better answering the purpose,
he constantly used, and from him others have also adopted it into
practice.][Footnote 102: This may be a good method of dividing the figure for the
purpose of reducing from large to small, or _vice versa_; but it not
being the method generally used by the painters for measuring their
figures, as being too minute, this chapter was not introduced amongst
those of general proportions.]cretae, use of, in entero-colitis and cholera infantum, 758

"Look here!A band of horsemen pursuing a white man--plainly an
American.Frank ran to the door, catching up a rifle that had been leaning against
the wall of the hut, for he knew he was in a "bad man's land."he shouted, forcing his way past the professor."No
countryman of mine can be in danger that I do not try to give him a
helping hand."You will bring the entire band down on us!"Past the hut at a distance a single horseman was riding, hotly spurring
the animal which bore him.At least a dozen dark-faced, fierce-looking
ruffians, mounted on hardy little ponies, were in pursuit.As Professor Scotch had said, the fugitive was plainly an American, a
native of the United States.He had turned in the saddle to send bullets
whistling back at his pursuers.The professor followed him, and
Hans came from the hut.Just as Frank lifted the rifle to his shoulder and was on the point of
shooting, the voice of Jack Burk sounded from the doorway, to which he
had dragged himself:

"It is Bushnell, my partner!His voice was faint and weak, and it did not reach the ears of the man
out on the plain.Then Frank began shooting, and his first bullet brought down one of the
ponies of the pursuers, sending a bandit rolling over and over in the
dust, to leap up like a cat, and spring behind a comrade on the back of
another pony."Dot peen britty goot, Vrankie," complimented Hans Dunnerwust.Again and again Frank fired, and the bandits quickly swerved away from
the hut, feeling their ponies sway or fall beneath them.In an astonishingly brief space of time the course of pursuit was
deflected, giving the fugitive a chance to get away into Mendoza, which
lay at a distance of about three miles from the hut.The man in flight heard the shots, saw the figures in front of the hut,
and waved his hand to them.The professor excitedly beckoned for Bushnell to come to the hut, but
the horseman did not seem to understand, and he kept straight on toward
the town."He don'd like a trap to run into," said Hans."Well, I don't know as I blame him.Of course he could not be sure it
was not a trap, and so he was cautious."Frank was calmly refilling the magazine of the rifle with fresh
cartridges."Why you didn't shoot some uf der pandits deat, Vrankie?""I do not wish to shed human blood if I can avoid it.""You don't done dot uf you shoot six or elefen uf dose togs."Dey vos volves--kiotes.""Well, I did not care to shoot them if I could aid the man in any other
way, and I succeeded.See, they have given up the pursuit, and the
fugitive is far away in that little cloud of dust.""We should follow him, and bring him back to his dying partner.""And leave Jack Burk here alone--possibly to die alone?"But Burk---- Look--see there,
professor!He is flat on his face in the doorway!He fell like that
after trying to shout to his partner."Frank leaped forward, and turned the man on his back.It was a drawn,
ghastly face that the trio gazed down upon.Professor Scotch quickly knelt beside the motionless form, feeling for
the pulse, and then shaking his head gravely."Has he----"

He was silent at a motion from the professor, who bent to listen for
some movement of the man's heart.After a few seconds, Professor Scotch straightened up, and solemnly
declared:

"This is the end for him."Now we can leave him," the professor finally said."Pacheco, the
bandit, cannot harm him now."They lifted the body and bore it back to the wretched bed of straw, on
which they tenderly placed it."You must not forget
that, Frank.It is here, where it fell from my
fingers as I ran out."He picked up the image, and placed it in one of his pockets.Then, having covered the face of Jack Burk with his handkerchief, Frank
led the way from the hut.Their horses had been tethered near at hand, and they were soon mounted
and riding away toward Mendoza.The sun beat down hotly on the plain of white sand, and the sky was of a
bright blue, such as Frank had never seen elsewhere.Outside Mendoza was a narrow canal, but a few feet in width, and half
filled with water, from which rose little whiffs of hot steam.Along the side of the canal was a staggering rude stone wall, fringed
with bushes in strips and clumps.Beyond the canal, which fixed the boundary of the plain of sand, through
vistas of tree trunks, could be seen glimpses of brown fields, fading
away into pale pink, violet, and green.The dome and towers of a church rose against the dim blue; low down, and
on every side were spots of cream-white, red, and yellow, with patches
of dark green intervening, revealing bits of the town, with orange
groves all about.Across the fields ran a road that was ankle deep with dust, and along
the road a string of burros, loaded with great bundles of green fodder,
were crawling into the town.An undulating mass of yellow dust finally revealed itself as a drove of
sheep, urged along by peons, appeared.Groups of natives were strolling in both directions, seeking the shadows
along the canal.The women were in straw hats, with their black hair
plaited, and little children strung to their backs; the men wore serapes
and sandals, and smoked cigarettes.Along the side of the canal were scattered scores of natives of all ages
and both sexes, lolling beneath the bushes or soaking their bodies in
the water, while their heads rested on the ground.Those stretched in the shadow of the bushes had taken their bath, and
were waiting for their bodies to dry, covered simply by serapes.From beneath such a covering dark-eyed native girls stared curiously at
the passing trio, causing Hans no small amount of confusion."I say, Vrankie," said the Dutch boy, "vot you dinks apoudt dot pusiness
uf dakin' a path in bublic mit der roadt beside?""It seems to be the custom of the country," smiled Frank; "and they do
not seem to think it at all improper.""Vell, somepody better toldt dem to stob id.Id keeps mein plood mein
face in so much dot I shall look like you hat peen drinking.""They think nothing of it," explained the professor."You will notice
with what deftness they disrobe, slipping out of their clothes and into
the water without exposing much more than a bare toe.""I don'd like to took mein chances py
looking.Somepody mighd make a misdake."The sun was low down as they rode into the town."We have no time to lose," said Frank."We must move lively, if we mean
to return to the hut before nightfall."They were successful in finding a native undertaker, but the fellow was
very lazy, and he did not want to do anything till the next day."To-morrow, senors, to-morrow," he said.That did not satisfy, however, and he was soon aroused by the sight of
money.Learning where the corpse was, he procured a cart and a burro,
and they again set out along the road.They found whole families soaking in groups in the canal, sousing their
babies in the water, and draining them on the bank.Young Indian girls in groups were combing out their hair and chatting
merrily among themselves and with friends in the water."Dere oughter peen some law for dot," muttered Hans.Leaving the canal, they set out upon the sand-plain, the undertaker's
burro crawling along at an aggravating pace, its master refusing to whip
it up, despite urging.The sun had set, and darkness was settling in a blue haze on the plain
when the hut was reached.Frank lighted a pocket lamp he always carried, and entered.A cry of astonishment broke from his lips."Yes, gone," repeated Frank, throwing the light about the room and
finally bringing it back to the bed of grass."Impossible or not, it is true, as you may see.""But the man was dead--as dead as he could be!"Dot man vos
teader as a goffin nail, und don'd you vorget him!"The trio were silent, staring in stupefied amazement at the bed of
grass.An uncanny feeling began to creep over Frank, and it seemed that a chill
hand touched his face and played about his temples."I am quite ill," the professor faintly declared, in a feeble tone of
voice."The exertions of the day have been far too severe for me."Oxcuse me while I
go oudt to ged a liddle fresh air."He made a bolt for the open door, and Professor Scotch was not long in
following.Frank, however, was determined to be thoroughly satisfied,
and he again began looking for the body of the dead man, once more going
over the entire hut."The body is gone, beyond a doubt," he finally muttered."There is no place for it to be concealed here, and dead men do not hide
themselves."He went out, and found Professor Scotch and Hans awaiting his appearance
with no small amount of anxiety.said the professor, with a deep breath of relief, "you are all
right.""All right," said Frank, with amusement; "of course I am.Fancy I was going to be spirited away by spooks?"The little man drew himself up with an assumption of great dignity."Young man," he rumbled, in his deepest tone, "don't be frivolous on
such an occasion as this.You are quite aware that I do not believe in
spooks or anything of the sort; but we are in a strange country now, and
strange things happen here.""Dot peen oxactly righdt.""For instance, the disappearance of that corpse is most remarkable.""Dot peen der first dime I nefer known a deat man to ged ub un valk avay
all alone mit himseluf by," declared Hans."What do you think has happened here, professor?""It is plain Jack Burk's body is gone.""And does it not seem reasonable that he walked away himself?""Vell, you don'd know apout dot," broke in Hans."Maype he don'd pelief
we vos goin' pack here to bury him, und he got tiret uf vaiting for der
funerals.""There must have been other people here after we left," said Frank.Frank fell to examining the ground for "signs," but, although his eyes
were unusually keen, he was not an expert in such matters, and he
discovered nothing that could serve as a revelation."The man was dead beyond a doubt, professor--you are sure?"roared the little man, bristling in a moment.Do you take me for a howling idiot?"The best of us are liable to err at
times.It would not be strange if you----"

"But I didn't--I tell you I didn't!The body may have been removed by
the bandits which hang about this section.""Or by Al Bushnell, Burk's partner.""Yes; Bushnell may have recognized him, although he did not seem to do
so.In that case, he has been here----"

"And that explains everything.""He took the body away to give it decent burial.""And we have had our trouble for nothing."By this time the native undertaker got the drift of the talk, and set up
a wail of lamentation and accusation.He had come all that distance at
great expense to himself and great waste of time during which he might
have been sleeping or smoking.He had a wife and many--very many children
depending on him.He had been tricked by the _Americanoes_, and he would
complain that he had been cheated.They should be arrested; they should
be compelled to pay."Oh, come your perch off, und gone took a fall to yournseluf!""You gif me der lifer gomblaint!"The native continued to wail and lament and accuse them until Frank
succeeded in quieting him by paying him three times as much as he would
have asked had the body been found in the hut.The old fellow saw how he
could make it appear as a clean case of deception on the part of the
strangers, and he worked his little game for all there was in it.Having
received his money, he lost no time in turning his cart about and
heading back toward Mendoza, evidently fearing the body might be found
at last and forced upon him."We'd better be going, too," said Professor Scotch."There is no telling what danger we may
encounter on the plain after nightfall.""Vell, don'd let us peen all nighd apout gedding a mofe on," fluttered
Hans, hastening toward the horses.So they mounted and rode away toward Mendoza, although Frank was far
from satisfied to do so without solving the mystery of the remarkable
disappearance.Darkness was falling heavily on the plain, across which a cool and
refreshing breath came from the distant mountains.Frank kept his eyes open for danger, more than half expecting to run
upon a gang of bandits at any moment.As they approached the town they
began to breathe easier, and, before long, they were riding along the
dusty road that led into the little town.Entering Mendoza they found on each hand low buildings connected by
long, white adobe walls, against which grew prickly pears in abundance,
running in straggling lines away out upon the open country.About the edges of the town were little fires, winking redly here and
there, with earthen pots which were balanced on smoldering embers raked
out from the general mass.Withered and skinny old hags were crooning over the pots, surrounded by
swarthy children and lazy men, who were watching the preparation of the
evening meal.Groups of peons, muffled to the eyes with their serapes, were sitting
with their backs to the adobe walls, apparently fast asleep; but Frank
noted that glittering, black eyes peered out from between the serapes
and the huts, and he had no doubt but that many of the fellows would
willingly cut a throat for a ridiculously small sum of money.All day the window shutters had been
closely barred, but now they were flung wide, and the flash of dark eyes
or the low, musical laugh of a senorita told that the maidens who had
lolled all the hot day were now astir.Doors were flung wide, and houses which at midday had seemed uninhabited
were astir with life.In the patios beautiful gardens were blooming, and
through iron gates easy-chairs and hammocks could be seen.Many of the senoritas had come forth, and were strolling in groups of
threes or fours, dressed in pink and white lawn, with Spanish veils and
fans.The most of them wore white stockings and red-heeled slippers.Many a witching glance was shyly cast at Frank, but his mind was so
occupied that he heeded none of them.The hotel was reached, and they were dismounting, when a battered and
tattered old man, about whose shoulders was cast a ragged blanket, and
whose face was hidden by a scraggly, white beard, came up with a
faltering step."Pardon me," he said, in a thin, cracked voice, "I see you are
Americans, natives of the States, Yankees, and, as I happen to be from
Michigan, I hasten to speak to you.I know you will have pity on an
unfortunate countryman.My son came to this wretched
land to try to make a fortune.He went into the mines, and was doing
well.He sent me home money, and I put a little aside, so that I had a
snug little sum after a time.Then he fell into the hands of Pacheco,
the bandit.You have heard of Pacheco, gentlemen?""We have," said Frank, who was endeavoring to get a fair look into the
old man's eyes."Vell, you can pet my poots on dot!""The wretch--the cutthroat!"cried the old man, shaking his clinched
hand in the air.He has robbed me of
everything--everything!""Tell us--finish your story," urged the professor.The light from a window shone close by the old man.Frank was waiting for the man to change his position so the light would
shine on his face.For some moments the man seemed too agitated to proceed, but he finally
went on."My son--my son fell into the hands of this wretched bandit.Then he sent word to me that he would murder my son if
I did not appear and pay two thousand dollars ransom money.I sold
it--I sold everything to raise the money to save my boy.And then--then, my friends, I received another letter.Then Pacheco
demanded three thousand dollars.""Der brice vos on der jump," murmured Hans.cried the old man, waving his arms,
excitedly.He wrung his hands, and groaned as if with great anguish."Be calm, be calm," urged Professor Scotch."My dear sir, you are
working yourself into a dreadful state.""It is not possible to be
calm and think of such a terrible thing!""You have not told the entire story,
and we do not know what you mean."With that letter Pacheco--the monster!--sent one of
my boy's little fingers!"I don'd toldt you dot, do I?"The professor and Hans uttered these exclamations, but Frank was calm
and apparently unmoved, with his eyes still fastened on the face of the
old man."How you toldt dot vos der finger uf your son, mister?""That's it, that's it--how could you tell?""My son--my own boy--he added a line to the letter, stating that the
finger had been taken from his left hand, and that Pacheco threatened to
cut off his fingers one by one and send them to me if I did not hasten
with the ransom money.""You recognized the handwriting as that of your son?""I did; but I recognized something besides that.""Oh, you may have been mistaken in that--surely you may.""A peculiar scar like a triangle, situated between the first and second
joints.Besides that, the nail had once been crushed, after which it was
never perfect.""That was quite enough," nodded Professor Scotch."Yah," agreed Hans; "dot peen quide enough alretty."Still Frank was silent, watching and waiting, missing not a word that
fell from the man's lips, missing not a gesture, failing to note no
move.This silence on the part of Merriwell seemed to affect the man, who
turned to him, saying, a trifle sharply:

"Boy, boy, have you no sympathy with me?Think of the suffering I have
passed through!"I am trying to raise some money to ransom my son.""Well, when I received that letter I immediately hastened to this land
of bandits and half-breeds.I did not have three thousand dollars, but I
hoped that what I had would be enough to soften Pacheco's heart--to save
my poor boy.""My boy is still in Pacheco's power, and I have not a dollar left in all
the world!"Well, what do you hope to do--what are you trying to do?""But you cannot raise it by begging in this land, man," said the
professor.Everybody seems to be poor and
wretched.""But I have found some of my own countrymen, and I hoped that you might
have pity on me--oh, I did hope!"You didn't expect us to give you five hundred dollars?""Think of my boy--my poor boy!Pacheco has threatened to murder him by
inches--to cut him up and send him to me in pieces!Is it not something
terrible to contemplate?""Vell, I should dink id vos!""And he took your money without setting your son free?""Did you tell him it was all you had in the world?""I told him that a score of times.""Told me to raise more, or have the pleasure of receiving my boy in
pieces.""How long have you been in Mendoza?""Two days, and during that time I have received this from Pacheco."He took something from his pocket--something wrapped in a handkerchief.With trembling fingers, he unrolled it, exposing to view----

A bloody human finger!Hans and Professor Scotch uttered exclamations of horror, starting back
from the sight revealed by the light that came from the window set deep
in the adobe wall.Frank's teeth came together with a peculiar click, but he uttered no
exclamation, nor did he start.This seemed to affect the old man unpleasantly, for he turned on Frank,
crying in an accusing manner and tone:

"Have you no heart?"This finger--it is the second torn from the hand of my boy by Pacheco,
the bandit--Pacheco, the monster!""Pacheco seems to be a man of great determination."Professor Scotch gazed at Frank in astonishment, for the boy was of a
very sympathetic and kindly nature, and he now seemed quite unlike his
usual self."Frank, Frank, think of the suffering of this poor father!""Yah," murmured Hans; "shust dink how pad you vould felt uf you efer
peen py his blace," put in Hans, sobbing, chokingly."It is very, very sad," said Frank; but there seemed to be a singularly
sarcastic ring to the words which fell from his lips."Have you seen your son since he fell into the hands of Pacheco, sir?""Yes, I saw him; but I could scarcely recognize him, he was so
changed--so wan and ghastly.The skin is drawn tightly over his bones,
and he looks as if he were nearly starved to death."The man wrung his hands with a gesture of unutterable anguish."Oh, his appeal--I can hear it now!He begged me to save him, or to
give him poison that he might kill himself!""That I cannot tell, for I was blindfolded all the time, except while in
the cave where my boy is kept.""It must be within fifty miles of here.""But you have no means of knowing in which direction it lies?""Your only hope is to raise the five hundred dollars?""That is my only hope, and that can scarcely be called a hope, for I
must have the money within a day or two, or my boy will be dead.""This is a very unfortunate
affair--very unfortunate.I am not a wealthy man, but I----"

"You will aid me?""Heaven will bless
you, sir--Heaven will bless you!""I have not said so--I have not said I would aid you," Scotch hastily
said."I am going to consider the matter--I'll think it over.""If your heart is not opened now, it will never open.My poor boy is
lost, and I am ready for death!"The old man seemed to break down and sob like a child, burying his face
in his hands, his body shaking convulsively.Frank made a quick gesture to the others, pressing a finger to his lips
as a warning for silence.In a moment the old man lifted his face, which seemed wet with tears."And you are travelers--you are
rich!"He turned to Frank, to whom, with an appealing gesture, he extended a
hand that was shaking as if with the palsy."You--surely you will have sympathy with me!I can see by your face and
your bearing that you are one of fortune's favorites--you are rich.A
few dollars----"

"My dear man," said Frank, quite calmly, "I should be more than
delighted to aid you, if you had told the truth."He was standing fairly in the light which shone
from the window."Do you think I have been lying
to you--do you fancy such a thing?""I fancy nothing; I know you have lied!"gurgled Hans Dunnerwust, in a dazed way.The manner of the old man changed in a twinkling."Well, I expected as much from a
beggar, a fraud, and a scoundrel!"Professor Scotch and Hans fell into each other's arms, overcome with
excitement and wonder.Frank was calm and deliberate, and he did not lift his voice above the
tone used in ordinary conversation.Still another step did the man fall back, and then a grating snarl broke
from his lips, and he seemed overcome with rage.He leaned forward,
hissing:

"You insulting puppy!""The truth must always seem like an insult to a scoundrel.""Your tune has changed in the twinkling of an eye.You are no longer the
heart-broken father, begging for his boy; but you have flung aside some
of the mask, and exposed your true nature."Professor Scotch saw this was true, and he was quaking with fear of what
might follow this remarkable change.As for Hans, it took some time for ideas to work their way through his
brain, and he was still in a bewildered condition.For a moment the stranger was silent, seeming to choke back words which
rose in his throat.Finally, he cried:

"Oh, very well!I did not expect to get anything out of you; but it
would have been far better for you if I had.Frank asked the question, as the speaker faltered.I am going to leave you, but we shall see
more of each other, don't forget that.""Wait--do not be in a hurry.I am not satisfied till I--see your face!"With the final words, Frank made a leap and a sweep of his hand,
clutching the white beard the man wore, and tearing it from his face!The face exposed was smoothly shaven and weather-tanned.This poor old man is
Carlos Merriwell, my villainous cousin!"CHAPTER V.

KIDNAPED.As our old readers know, Carlos Merriwell was Frank's deadly enemy,
although they were blood cousins.Carlos was the son of Asher Merriwell, the brother of Frank's father.At the time of his death, Asher Merriwell was supposed to be a crusty
old bachelor, a man who had never cared for women and had never married.But he had not been a woman-hater all his life, and there was a romance
in his career.Asher Merriwell had been snared by the wiles of an adventuress, and he
had married her.By this woman he had a son, but the marriage had been
kept a secret, so that when she deceived him and they quarreled they
were able to separate and live apart without the fact becoming public
that Merriwell had been married.Fortunately the woman died without openly proclaiming herself as the
wife of Asher Merriwell.In her veins there had been Spanish blood, and
her son was named Carlos.After the death of his wife, Asher Merriwell set about providing for and
educating the boy, although Carlos continued to bear his mother's maiden
name of Durcal.As Carlos grew up he developed into a wild and reckless young blade,
making no amount of trouble and worry for his father.Asher Merriwell did his best for the boy, but there was bad blood in the
lad's veins, and it cost the man no small sums to settle for the various
"sports" in which Carlos participated.Finally Carlos took a fancy to strike out and see the world for himself,
and he disappeared without telling whither he was going.After this, he troubled his father at intervals until he committed a
crime in a foreign country, where he was tried, convicted, and
imprisoned for a long term of years.This was the last straw so far as Asher Merriwell was concerned, and he
straightway proceeded to disown Carlos, and cut him off without a cent.It was afterward reported that Carl Durcal had been shot by guards while
attempting to escape from prison, and Asher Merriwell died firmly
believing himself to be sonless.At his death, Asher left everything to Frank Merriwell, the son of his
brother, and provided that Frank should travel under the guardianship of
Professor Scotch, as the eccentric old uncle believed travel furnished
the surest means for "broadening the mind."But Carlos Merriwell had not been killed, and he had escaped from
prison.Finding he had been cut off without a dollar and everything had
been left to Frank, Carlos was furious, and he swore that his cousin
should not live to enjoy the property.In some ways Carlos was shrewd; in others he was not.He was shrewd
enough to see that he might have trouble in proving himself the son of
Asher Merriwell by a lawful marriage, and so he did not attempt it.But there was a still greater stumbling block in his way, for if he came
out and announced himself and made a fight for the property, he would be
forced to tell the truth concerning his past life, and the fact that he
was an escaped convict would be made known.If he could not
have his father's property, he swore again and again that Frank should
not hold it.With all the reckless abandon of his nature, Carlos made two mad
attempts on Frank's life, both of which were baffled, and then the young
desperado was forced to make himself scarce.But Carlos had become an expert crook, and he was generally flush with
ill-gotten gains, so he was able to put spies on Frank.He hired private
detectives, and Frank was continually under secret surveillance.Thus it came about that Carlos knew when Frank set about upon his
travels, and he set a snare for the boy in New York City.Straight into this snare Frank walked, but he escaped through his own
exertions, and then baffled two further attempts on his life.By this time Carlos found it necessary to disappear again, and Frank had
neither seen nor heard from him till this moment, when the fellow stood
unmasked in the Mexican town of Mendoza.Frank had become so familiar with his villainous cousin's voice and
gestures that Carlos had not been able to deceive him.From the first,
Frank had believed the old man a fraud, and he was soon satisfied that
the fellow was Carlos.On Carlos Merriwell's cheek was a scar that had been hidden by the false
beard--a scar that he would bear as long as he lived.Professor Scotch nearly collapsed in a helpless heap, so completely
astounded that he could not utter a word.As for Hans, he simply gasped:

"Shimminy Gristmas!"A snarling exclamation of fury broke from Carlos' lips."Oh, you're too sharp, my fine cousin!"he grated, his hand disappearing
beneath the ragged blanket.Out came the hand, and a knife flashed in the light that shone from the
window of the hotel.Frank, however, was on the alert, and was watching
for just such a move.With a twisting movement, he drew his body aside,
so the knife clipped down past his shoulder, cutting open his sleeve,
but failing to reach his flesh."That was near it," he said, as he whirled and caught Carlos by the
wrist.Frank had a clutch of iron, and he gave Carlos' wrist a wrench that
forced a cry from the fellow's lips, and caused the knife to drop to the
ground."You are altogether too handy with such a weapon," said the boy, coolly."It is evident your adeptness with a dagger comes from your mother's
side.Your face is dark and treacherous, and you look well at home in
this land of dark and treacherous people."Carlos ground forth a fierce exclamation, making a desperate move to
fling Frank off, but failing.You were lucky at Fardale, and you were lucky in New
York.Now you have come to a land where I will have my turn."I have listened to your threats before this.""I have made no threats that shall not come true.""What a desperate wretch you are, Carlos!I would have met you on even
terms, and come to an agreement with you, if you----"

"Bah!You have robbed me of
what is rightfully mine, and I have sworn you shall not take the good of
it.A strange cry broke from his lips, as he found he could not tear his
wrist from Frank's fingers.Then came a rush of catlike footfalls and a clatter of hoofs.All at
once voices were heard, crying:

"Ladrones!Dark figures appeared on every hand, sending natives fleeing to shelter.Spanish oaths sounded on the evening air, and the glint of steel was
seen."Uf we don'd peen in a
heap uf drouble, I know noddings!""They have charged
right into the town, and they----"

"Ha!They are here, and it is my turn!"A horseman was riding straight down on Frank, and the boy flung Carlos
aside, making a leap that took him out of the way.Something, glittering brightly, descended in a sweep toward Frank's
head, but the blow was stopped by Carlos, who shouted something in
Spanish.Frank understood Spanish well enough to catch the drift of the words,
and he knew his cousin had not saved him through compassion, but for
quite another purpose.Carlos coveted the riches into which Frank had fallen, and he meant to
have a portion of the money.If Frank were killed, there was little
chance that he would ever handle a dollar of the fortune, so he had
cried out that his cousin was to be spared, captured, and held for
ransom.That was enough to warn Frank of the terrible peril that overshadowed
him at the moment.Out came his revolvers, and his back went against the wall.Upward were
flung his hands, and the weapons began to crack.Two horses fell, sent down by the first two bullets from the pistols of
the boy at bay.But Frank found he could not shoot horses and save himself, for dark
forms were pressing upon him, and he must fall into the clutches of the
bandits in another moment unless he resorted to the most desperate
measures."If you will have it, then you shall!"he muttered, through his set
teeth, turning his aim on the human forms.Spouts of red fire shot from the muzzles of the revolvers, and the
cracking of the weapons was followed by cries and groans.Through a smoky haze Frank saw some of the dark figures fling up their
arms and topple to the ground within a few feet of him.He wondered what had become of Hans and the professor, for he could see
nothing of either, and they had been close at hand a moment before.In the midst of all this, Frank wondered at his own calmness.His one
thought was that not a bullet should be wasted, and then he feared he
would find his weapons empty and useless before the desperadoes were
rebuffed.But this reception was something the bandits had not expected from a
boy.They had no heart to stand up before a lad who could shoot with the
skill of a Gringo cowboy, and did not seem at all excited when attacked
by twenty men.Mexican half-bloods are cowards at heart, and, by the time they saw two
or three of their number fall before the fire from Frank's revolvers
they turned and took to their heels like a flock of frightened sheep."Say, holdt on avile und led me ged a few pullets indo you, mein
friendts."It was Hans' voice, and, looking down, Frank saw the Dutch lad on the
ground at his feet, whither he had crept on hands and knees."What are you down there for, Hans?""Vot you dink, Vrankie?You don'd subbose I sdood up all der dime und
ged in der vay der pullets uf?Vell, you may oxcuse me!I don'd like to
peen a deat man alretty yet."I admire der vay you vork dose revolfers.Dot peat
der pand, und don'd you vorged him!"At this moment, a horse with a double burden swept past in the flare of
light."Dot's vat he vos!""Dose pandits haf dooken them, I susbect."This was true; Frank had killed two of the horses belonging to the
bandits, but the desperadoes had escaped with the three animals hired by
our friends.But that was not the worst, for Professor Scotch had been captured and
carried away by the bold ruffians.Frank heard the professor's appeals for help, and heard a mocking,
cold-blooded laugh that he knew came from the lips of Carlos Merriwell.Then the clatter of hoofs passed on down the street, growing fainter and
fainter, till they left the town for the open plain, and finally died
out in the night.CARRIED INTO THE MOUNTAINS.In vain, Frank attempted to organize a party to pursue the bandits.The
citizens of Mendoza were completely terrorized, and they had no heart to
follow the desperadoes out upon the plain, which was the bandits' own
stamping ground.Frank urged, entreated, begged, and finally grew furious, but he simply
wasted his breath."No, no, senor," protested a Mexican."You no find anybody dat chase
Pacheco dis night--no, no, not much!"You don't mean to say--you can't mean----"

"Dat was Pacheco and his band, senor."he muttered, huskily; "Pacheco, the worst wretch in all
Mexico!He is utterly heartless, and the professor will---- But Pacheco
is not the worst!""There is Carlos Merriwell, who
must be one of the bandits.He may take a fancy to torture Professor
Scotch simply because the professor is my guardian.""I do not understand
all dat you speak."Frank turned away, with a gesture of despair."Vot you goin's to done, Vrankie?""I do not seem to be able to do anything now.This matter must be placed
before the authorities, but I do not fancy that will amount to anything.The officers here are afraid of the bandits, and the government is
criminally negligent in the matter of pushing and punishing the outlaws.The capture of an American to be held for ransom will be considered by
them as a very funny joke.""Vell, I don'd seen vot you goin' to done apout it.""I do not see myself, but, come on, and we will find out."He sought the highest officials of the town, and laid the matter before
them.In the most polite manner possible, they protested their pained
solicitation and commiseration, but when he urged them to do something,
they replied:

"To-morrow, senor, or the next day, we will see what we may be able to
do.""With you everything is
to-morrow, to-morrow!To-day, to-night, now is the time to do something!Delays are fatal, particularly in pursuing bandits and kidnapers."But they shook their heads sadly, and continued to express sympathy and
regret, all the while protesting it would be impossible to do anything
before to-morrow or the next day.Frank was so furious and desperate that he even had thought of following
the bandits with Hans as an only companion, but the man of whom he had
obtained the horses in the first place would not let him have other
animals.This man had gone through some kind of proceeding to
lawfully seize Frank and Hans and hold them till the animals captured by
the bandits were paid for at the price he should name, and this he
proceeded to do.Now, Frank did not have the price demanded for the three horses, and he
could not draw it that night, so he was obliged to submit, and the two
boys were prisoners till near three o'clock the next afternoon, when the
money was obtained and the bill paid.At the hotel Frank found a letter awaiting him, and, to his unbounded
amazement, it was from the professor.With haste he tore it open, and these words are what he read:

     "DEAR FRANK: Pacheco commands me to write this letter.We are at
     the headwaters of the Rio de Nieves, but we move on to the westward
     as soon as I have written.He tells me we are bound for the
     mountains beyond Huejugilla el Alto, which is directly west of
     Zacatecas as the bird flies one hundred and ten miles.He bids me
     tell you to follow to Huejugilla el Alto, where he says
     arrangements will be made for my ransom.He
     spoke of the mountains to the west of Zacatecas.Pacheco threatens
     to mutilate me and forward fragments to you if you do not follow to
     the point specified.He is watching me as I write, and one of his
     men will carry this letter to Mendoza, and deliver it.The
     situation is desperate, and it strikes me that it is best to comply
     with Pacheco's demands in case you care to bother about me.If you
     want me to be chopped up bit by bit and forwarded to you, do not
     bother to follow.I have no doubt but Pacheco will keep his word to
     the letter in this matter.I am, my dear boy, your devoted guardian
     and tutor,

                                            "HORACE ORMAN TYLER SCOTCH."That this letter was genuine there could be no doubt, as it was written
in the professor's peculiar style of chirography; but it did not sound
like the professor, and Frank knew well enough that it had been written
under compulsion, and the language had been dictated by another party.He knows I will do everything I can for him.""Yah, but he don'd seem to say dot der ledder in," observed Hans, who
had also read every word."Huejugilla el Alto is one hundred and ten miles west of Zacatecas.""Vere you belief they findt dot name, Vrankie?"Frank did not mind the Dutch lad's question, but bowed his head on his
hand, and fell to thinking."We must have horses, and we must follow.Surely
the professor put that part of the letter in of his own accord.He did
not speak of the Silver Palace, but he wished to call it to my mind.That palace, according to Burk, lies directly west of Zacatecas,
somewhere amid the mountains beyond this place he has mentioned.The
professor meant for me to understand that I would be proceeding on my
way to search for the palace."Yah," broke in Hans, "berhaps he meant to done dot, Vrankie.""We would be very near the mountains--it must be that we would be in the
mountains.""I guess dot peen shust apoudt vere we peen, Vrankie.""If he escaped, or should be rescued or ransomed, we could easily
continue the search for the palace.""You vos oxactly righdt.""We had better proceed to Zacatecas, and procure the animals and the
guide there.""Shust oxactly vot I vould haf suggestet, Vrankie.""But Carlos--Carlos, my cousin.It is very strange, but Professor Scotch
does not mention him.""And I am certain it was Carlos that captured the professor.I heard the
fellow laugh--his wicked, triumphant laugh!""I heardt dot meinseluf, Vrankie.""And Pacheco is carrying this matter out to suit my cousin.""Hans, it is possible you had better remain behind."gurgled the Dutch lad, in blank amazement."Vot for vos I
goin' to gone pehindt und stay, Vrankie?""I see a trap in this--a plot to lead me into a snare and make me a
captive.""Vell, don'd I stood ub und took mein medicine mit you all der dimes?Vot vos der maddetr mit me?Vos you lost your courage in me alretty
yet?""Hans, I have no right to take you into such danger.Without doubt, a
snare will be spread for me, but I am going to depend on fate to help me
to avoid it.""Vell, I took some stock dot fate in meinseluf.""If I should take you along and you were killed----"

"I took your chances on dot, mein poy.Vot vos I draveling aroundt mit
you vor anyhow you vant to know, ain'dt id?""You are traveling for pleasure, and not to fight bandits.""Uf dot peen a bard der bleasure uf, you don'd haf some righdt to rob me
uf id.Vrank Merriwell, dit you efer know me to gone pack mit you on?"I am
going righdt along mit you, und don'd you rememper dot!""Hans," he said, "you are true blue.We will stick by each other till
the professor is saved from Pacheco and Carlos Merriwell."They clasped hands, and that point was settled.Without unnecessary delay, they took the train from Mendoza to
Zacatecas, which was a much larger place.In Zacatecas they set about the task of finding a reliable guide, which
was no easy matter, as they soon discovered.The Mexican half-bloods were a lazy, shiftless set, and the full-blooded
Spaniards did not seem to care about taking the trip across the desert.Till late that night Frank searched in vain for the man he wanted, and
he was finally forced to give up the task till another day.Such a delay made him very impatient, and he felt much like starting out
without a guide, depending on a compass, with which he believed he would
be able to make his way due west to Huejugilla el Alto.The landlord of the hotel at which they stopped that night was a
fine-appearing man, and Frank ventured to lay the matter before him.The landlord listened to the entire story, looking very grave, shook his
head warningly, and said:

"Do not think of attempting to cross the desert alone, young senors.Without a guide you might get lost and perish for water."But how are we to obtain a trustworthy guide, sir?""That is truly a problem, but I think I may be able to assist you in the
morning.""If you can, it will be a great favor."If you would
take my advice, you would not go to Huejugilla el Alto.""It is far from the railroad, and is situated in a very wild region.If
you were to go there and should never be heard of again, it would not be
easy for your friends to discover what had become of you.Pacheco
directed you to go there, and he means you no good.It is likely you
will walk into a trap that Pacheco has set for you.""I have considered that," said Frank, quietly; "and I have decided to
go.""Oh, very well," with a gesture expressive of regret."I know it is
quite impossible to change the determination of you Americans.If you
have firmly decided to go, you will go, even though you knew all the
deadly dangers that may lie in wait for you."Being again assured that the landlord would do his best to obtain a
guide, Frank proposed to retire for the night.For all of the troubles that beset him, Frank was able to sleep soundly,
having trained himself to sleep under almost any circumstances.Hans
also slept and snored, to be awakened in the morning by Frank, who was
shaking him roughly."Come, Hans, it is time we were stirring.""We don'd peen asleep
more as fifteen minutes alretty yet."Hans got up and dressed with great reluctance, yawning, and declaring
over and over that the nights in Mexico were not more than fifteen or
twenty minutes in length.The landlord had prepared a special breakfast for them, and it proved
the best they had found since leaving "the States," so they ate heartily
and felt much better afterward.After breakfast the landlord himself informed them that he had been able
to obtain a guide."He is the very person you want, young senors, for he knows the desert
and he knows the mountains.You may depend on him to lead you straight
across to Huejugilla el Alto."The guide was waiting for them, wrapped to his chin in a crimson poncho,
and smoking a cigarette.He was a dark-faced, somewhat sinister-looking
fellow, and he gave his name as Pedro.While Frank did not like the appearance of the man, he felt that it was
not policy to delay longer, and a bargain was soon made.Pedro not only
agreed to take them quickly across the desert, but he contracted to
furnish horses for them.The forenoon was not far advanced when they rode out of Zacatecas, and,
with the sun at their backs, headed toward the west.Before the day passed Pedro showed by many things that he was quite
familiar with the desert.He knew where shade and water were to be
found, and, at noonday, they rested long beside a spring, with the sun
beating on the wide waste of sand, over which the heat haze danced, and
where no cooling breath seemed astir.The heat affected Hans much more than it did Frank.The Dutch boy
suffered, but he made no complaint.With the sun well over into the western sky, they pushed onward again.They did not halt as the grateful shadows of night lay on the desert,
but followed Pedro on and on.At last, far across the desert, they saw the twinkling of a light that
seemed like a fallen star."It's a camp-fire," declared Pedro, in Spanish."It may be bandits," suggested Frank, somewhat wary."No," declared the guide, "bandits do not build fires on the open
plains.He did not hesitate to lead them straight toward the fire.Frank whispered to Hans:

"Have your weapons ready.As they approached the fire, they were able to make out the figures of
two or three horses, but no human being was to be seen, although a
coffeepot sat on some coals, fragrant steam rising from the nozzle.Pedro stopped, seeming somewhat uneasy for the first time."Vos der camp left all alone mit ids
lonesome?""Not that, senors; but we have been heard, and the ones at the camp are
hiding and watching."Maype dey haf der trop on us alretty soon."Pedro called out something in Spanish, but there was no answer, save
that one of the horses lifted its head and neighed.Then Frank tried it in English:

"Ho, the camp!Almost instantly a man's voice replied:

"I'm out hyar whar I kin take a peep at yer, as I heard yer comin'.Didn't know but you wus Greasers, an' I ain't got no use fer ther onery
varmints.As yer kin talk United States, just move right up ter the fire
and join me at supper."There was a hearty freedom about the invitation that dispelled Frank's
fears immediately, and they rode forward into the firelight.As they did so, a man rose from where he had been stretched on the sand,
and came forward to meet them.shouted Frank, as the firelight fell on the man's face."It's Alwin Bushnell, Jack Burk's partner!""Thet thar's my handle," acknowledged the man; "but I'm strapped ef I
understand how you 'uns happen ter know it!"He stared at the boys and the guide in blank amazement.Seeing Pedro's
face fairly, he gave a slight start, and then looked still more closely."There's no doubt," palpitated Frank; "you are Alwin Bushnell?""That's me," nodded the camper."For the mountains and the Silver----"

Frank caught himself, and stopped short, remembering Pedro, and knowing
the guide's ears and eyes were wide open to hear and see everything.Bushnell fell back a step, a look of still greater surprise coming to
his bronzed and bearded face."W'at's thet thar you wus goin' ter say?""Wait," said Frank, "I will tell you later.Plainly, Alwin Bushnell was puzzled, and not a little amazed."You know my handle, an' you seem ter know whatever way I'm trailin'.This yere lays over me, as I acknowledges instanter.""Then I begs yer to explain it without delay.""Two days ago, outside of Mendoza.""When you were pursued across the plain by bandits."he cried; "I remembers yer now!You wuz near a doby hut, an' yer
opened up on ther pizen skunks as wuz arter me.""Wall, I'm much obliged, fer you socked ther lead ter them critters so
they switched off an' let me get away.Wa'al, that's right, you bet!I'm
mortal glad ter clap peepers on yer, fer I never expected ter see yer
an' thank yer fer thet trick."Frank swung from the saddle, and surrendered his hand into the broad
"paw" of the rough and hearty Westerner, who gave it a crushing grip and
a rough shake, repeating:

"I'm mortal glad ter see yer, thet's whatever!But I want ter know how
you happened to chip inter thet thar little game.You took a hand at
jest ther right time ter turn ther run of ther cards, an' I got out
without goin' broke.""I chipped in because I saw you were a white man, and you were hard
pressed by a villainous crew who must be bandits.I believe in white men
standing by white men.""Say, thet's a great motter, young man.As fer me, I don't like a Greaser none whatever."As he said this, Bushnell gave Pedro another searching look, and the
guide scowled at the ground in a sullen way."Now," continued the Westerner, "w'at I wants ter know next is w'at yer
knows about Jack Burk.We had a place all agreed on ter meet w'en I
returned, but he wusn't thar, an' I hed ter go it alone.That's why I'm
yere alone.""It was not Burk's fault that he did not meet you."Then lay a straight trail fer me ter foller."Wa'al, derned ef I could seem ter cut his trail
anywhar I went, an' I made a great hustle fer it.""He was in the hut where you saw us.""Wa'al, dern my skin!Ef I'd knowed thet, I'd made a straight run fer
thet yere ranch, bet yer boots!""He came to the door, and shouted to you.""An' I didn't get to see him!Say,
this clean upsets me, sure as shootin'!""We've made many a tramp together, an' we
struck it rich at last, but he'll never git ther good of thet thar
strike."Then he seemed to remember that he was watched by several eyes, and he
straightened up, passing his hand over his face."Jack shall hev a big monumint," he cried."Tell me whar my old pard is
planted.""That is something I do not know, Mr.Frank told the entire story of Burk's death and mysterious
disappearance, to which Bushnell listened, with breathless interest.When it was finished, the man cried:

"Thet thar beats me!"There is no doubt but Burk was dead,
and the corpse did not walk away of its own accord.It was my intention
to investigate the mystery, but later events prevented."Frank then explained about the kidnaping of Professor Scotch by the
bandits.While the boy was relating this, Bushnell was closely studying the
guide's face, as revealed by the firelight.Frank noted that a strange
look seemed to come into the eyes of the Westerner, and he appeared to
be holding himself in check.When this explanation was finished, Bushnell asked:

"And you are on your way ter Huejugilla el Alto with ther hope of
rescuin' ther professor?""This is the guide who was recommended to you in Zacatecas?""Wa'al, boys, ef this yere critter can't take yer straight ter Pacheco,
nobody kin."cried Bushnell, explosively; "this yere Greaser galoot w'at
yer calls Pedro is nobody but Ferez!"Frank uttered a cry of amazement and anger, wheeling quickly on the
Mexican, his hand seeking the butt of a revolver.But the dark-faced rascal seemed ready for such an exposure, for, with a
yell of defiance, he dropped behind his horse, and the animal shot like
a rocket from the firelight into the shadows which lay thick on the
desert.Bushnell opened up with a brace of revolvers, sending a dozen bullets
whistling after the fellow, in less than as many seconds.At the first shot, Hans Dunnerwust fell off his horse, striking on his
back on the sand, where he lay, faintly gurgling:

"Uf you don'd shood der odder vay, I vos a tead man!""Don't let him escape with a whole skin!"shouted Frank, as he began to
work a revolver, although he was blinded by the flashes from Bushnell's
weapon so that he was forced to shoot by guess.Ferez seemed to bear a charmed life, for he fled straight on into the
night, sending back a mocking shout of laughter.From far out on the
waste, he cried:

"Bah, Gringo dogs!I will see you again,
_Americanoes_.With an angry exclamation of disappointment and anger, Bushnell flung
his empty revolvers on the sand at his feet."Ef I'd done my shootin' first an' my
talkin' arterward, he wouldn't got away."But Ferez had escaped, and they could only make the best of it.When this was over and the excitement had subsided, they sat about the
fire and discussed the situation.Frank then showed the golden image
which Burk had given him, and explained how the dying man had told of
the Silver Palace.Bushnell listened quietly, a cloud on his face.At the conclusion of the
story, he rose to his feet, saying:

"Ef Jack Burk made you his heir, thet goes, an' I ain't kickin' none
whatever.Old Jack didn't hev no relatives, so he hed a right to make
any galoot his heir.But thar's goin' ter be plenty of worry fer anybody
as tries ter reach ther Silver Palace.How'd you'spect ter git 'crost
ther chasm?""As yet, I have not taken that into consideration.The kidnaping of
Professor Scotch has banished thoughts of everything else from my mind.""Wa'al, ef Jack Burk made you his heir, you're entitled ter your half of
ther treasure, providin' you're ready ter stand your half of ther
expenses ef we fail ter git thar.""You may depend on me so far as that is concerned.""Wa'al, then, you see I hev three hawses.One is fer me ter ride,
another is ter kerry provisions, and ther third is ter tote ther
balloon."I hev another balloon with which ter cross thet thar
chasm.In crossin' ther balloon will be
loaded with a ballast of sand; but when we come back, ther ballast will
be pure gold!"THE PROFESSOR'S ESCAPE.They did not expect to reach Huejugilla el Alto without being molested
by bandits, for it was presumed that Pacheco's lieutenant would carry
the word to his chief, and the desperadoes would lose no time in moving
against them.Knowing their danger, they were exceedingly cautious, traveling much by
night, and keeping in concealment by day, and, to their surprise, the
bandits made no descent upon them.Huejugilla el Alto proved to be a wild and picturesque place.Being far
from the line of railroad, it had not even felt the touch of Northern
civilization, and the boys felt as if they had been transported back to
the seventeenth century."Hyar, lads," said Bushnell, "yer will see a town thet's clean Greaser
all ther way through, an' it's ten ter one thar ain't nary galoot
besides ourselves in ther durned old place thet kin say a word of United
States."The Westerner could talk Spanish after a fashion, and that was about all
the natives of Huejugilla el Alto were able to do, with the exception of
the few whose blood was untainted, and who claimed to be aristocrats.However, for all of their strange dialect and his imperfect Spanish,
Bushnell succeeded in making himself understood, so they found lodgings
at a low, rambling adobe building, which served as a hotel.They paid in
advance for one day, and were well satisfied with the price, although
Bushnell declared it was at least double ordinary rates."We ain't likely ter be long in town before Ferez locates us an' comes
arter his hawses.Ther derned bandits are bold enough 'long ther line of
ther railroad, but they lay 'way over thet out hyar.Wuss then all, ther
people of ther towns kinder stand in with ther pizen varmints.""Why, hide 'em when ther soldiers is arter 'em, an' don't bother 'em at
any other time.""I presume they are afraid of the bandits, which explains why they do
so."Wa'al, I'll allow as how they may be; but then thar's
something of ther bandit in ev'ry blamed Greaser I ever clapped peepers
on.Frank had noted that almost all Westerners who mingled much with the
people of Mexico held Spaniards and natives alike in contempt, calling
them all "Greasers."He could not understand this, for, as he had
observed, the people of the country were exceedingly polite and
chivalrous, treating strangers with the utmost courtesy, if courtesy
were given in return.Rudeness seemed to shock and wound them, causing
them to draw within themselves, as a turtle draws into its shell.Indeed, so polite were the people that Frank came to believe that a
bandit who had decided to cut a man's throat and rob him would first beg
a man's pardon for such rudeness, and then proceed about the job with
the greatest skill, suavity, and gentleness.Having settled at the hotel, Bushnell ordered a square meal, and, when
it was served, they proceeded to satisfy the hunger which had grown upon
them with their journey across the desert.Bushnell also took care to look after the horses and equipments himself."Ef Ferez calls fer his hawses, I don't want him ter git away with this
yar balloon an' gas generator," said the Westerner, as he saw the
articles mentioned were placed under lock and key."Ef we should lose
them, it'd be all up with us so fur as gittin' ter ther Silver Palace is
concerned."Frank expected to hear something from Pacheco as soon as Huejugilla el
Alto was reached, but he found no message awaiting him."I expect he has suffered untold torments
since he was kidnaped.""Uf Brofessor Scotch don'd peen britty sick uf dis
vild life mit Mexico, you vos a liar."That night they were sitting outside the hotel when they heard a great
commotion at the southern end of the town.gasped the Dutch boy, in alarm."Sounds like dere vos
drouple aroundt dot logality.""That's right," agreed Frank, feeling for his revolvers; "and it is
coming this way as fast as it can.""Mebbe another revolution has broke out," observed Bushnell, lazily."Best git under kiver, an' let ther circus go by."They could hear the clatter of horses' hoofs, the cracking of pistols,
and a mingling of wild cries.All at once Frank Merriwell became somewhat excited."On my life, I believe I hear the voice of Professor Scotch!"said Hans, "I belief I hear dot, too!""They may be bringin' ther professor in," said Bushnell."Ef he's thar,
we'll take an interest in ther case, you bet yer boots!"Into the hotel he dashed, and, in a moment, he returned with his
Winchester.Along the street came a horseman, clinging to the back of an unsaddled
animal, closely pursued by at least twenty wild riders, some of whom
were shooting at the legs of the fleeing horse, while one was whirling a
lasso to make a cast that must bring the animal to a sudden halt."Ten to one, the fugitive is the professor!"shouted Frank, peering
through the dusk."Then, I reckon we'll hev ter chip in right hyar an' now," said
Bushnell, calmly.He flung the Winchester to his shoulder, and a spout of fire streamed
from the muzzle in an instant.The fellow who was whirling the lasso flung up his arm and plunged
headlong from the horse's back to the dust of the street."Can't do it," came back the reply."Jump off--fall off--get off some way!"In another moment Professor Scotch, for it really was that individual,
flung himself from the back of the animal he had ridden, struck the
ground, rolled over and over like a ball, and lay still within thirty
feet of Frank, groaning dolefully.In the meantime, Al Bushnell was working his Winchester in a manner that
was simply amazing, for a steady stream of fire seemed to pour from the
muzzle of the weapon, and the cracking of the weapon echoed through the
streets of Huejugilla el Alto like the rattling fire from a line of
infantry.After that first shot Bushnell lowered the muzzle of his weapon, as, in
most cases at short range, his motto was to "shoot low," for he well
knew more lead could be wasted by shooting too high than in any other
manner.In about three seconds he had thrown the pursuing bandits into the
utmost confusion, for they had never before encountered such a reception
in Huejugilla el Alto, and it was the last thing they had expected.With
all possible haste, they reined about and took to flight, hearing the
bullets whistling about them, or feeling their horses leap madly at the
sting of lead or go plunging to the ground.The inhabitants of the town had fled into their houses before the rush
of the bandits, so there was little danger that any of Bushnell's
bullets would reach innocent persons.The confusion and rout of the bandits was brought about in a few
seconds, and Bushnell was heard to mutter:

"One white man is good fer a hundred onery Greasers any time!Ther
derned skunks hain't got a blamed bit of sand!"Frank ran and lifted the fallen professor, flinging the man across his
shoulder, and carrying him into the hotel.Hans followed with frantic haste, and Bushnell came sauntering lazily in
after the bandits had been routed and driven back."I'm shot full of holes, and
every bone in my body is broken!We'll meet in a
better land, where there are no bandits to molest or make afraid."You can't touch me where I'm not shot!They fired
more than four hundred bullets through me!I am so full of holes that I
wonder you can see me at all!"Bushnell made a hasty examination of the professor, who lay on the
floor, groaning faintly, his eyes closed."Look hyar, pard," said the Westerner, roughly, "ef you want ter pass in
yer chips ye'll hev ter stand up an' let me put a few more holes in yer.I can't find a place whar you're touched by a bullet an' I'm blowed ef I
'low you broke a bone when ye tumbled from ther hawse.""Yah," nodded Hans, gravely; "I can belief me.You vas all righdt
brofessor, und dot is sdraight."shouted Scotch, bounding to his feet like a rubber ball."That's
what I call great luck!Why, I thought I must be killed sure!I don't
know how I escaped all those bullets."Vell, I don'd know apoudt dot pefore you come der town in," said Hans;
"but you vos alone mit yourself when we saw you, brofessor."The landlord of the hotel came bustling up in a perfect tumult of
terror, wringing his hands and almost weeping.he cried, in Spanish, "what have you done?You stopped at my house, and you shoot the ladrones.Ah, senors, you
know not what that means to me.Pacheco will come down on me--he will
raid my house; I am a ruined man, and you are responsible for it.If you remain here, the whole town
will rise against me!All the people will know this must make Pacheco
very angry, and they will know he must take revenge on the place.They
will be angry with me because I allow it.It came, and it was all over before I know what was
doing.Senors, you must have pity on me--you must leave my house
immeditely."Bushnell caught enough of this to translate it to the others."Ther best thing we kin do is ter git out instanter," he said."Ef we
wait, ther outlaws will watch every road out of ther town, an' we'll hev
trouble in gittin' away.""Then let's get away immediately," fluttered the professor."If I fall
into their hands again, I'm a dead man!""Yes, we will get out immediately," decided Frank; "but we'll do it as
secretly and silently as possible."Bushnell nodded his satisfaction, and, thirty minutes later, the party
was ready to move.They left the hotel by a back way, and, guided by the
landlord, made their way along dark and narrow streets, creeping
cautiously through the town till the outskirts were reached.There Frank gave the landlord some money, and, after calling down
blessings on their heads, he quickly slipped away and disappeared."Now we'll hustle right along," said the Westerner."We'll put a good
long stretch between ourselves an' Huejugilla el Alto before mornin'.We're off, bound straight inter ther mountains----"

"And straight for the Silver Palace," added Frank.CHAPTER X.

THE STRANGER.They were fortunate in getting away without being seen by any of the
bandits, and at dawn they were well up into the mountains, where
Bushnell found a secluded place for them to camp and rest, as rest was
something of which they all sorely stood in need.Bushnell prepared breakfast, and Frank insisted that Professor Scotch
should explain how he escaped from Pacheco's gang."Don't ask me," sighed the little man, fondling his red whiskers."I
can't explain it--really I can't.""Well, you see, I don't know how I happened to do it.They forced me to
write that letter against my will, two of them standing over me with
drawn daggers while I was writing, and prodding me a bit whenever I
refused to put down the words Pacheco ordered written.""He kept his face concealed with his serape quite up to his eyes.""Thar's a mystery about Pacheco," broke in Bushnell."No one seems ter
know jest what ther varmint looks like.""Go on, professor," urged Frank; "tell us just how you escaped.""I tell you I do not know myself.All I know is that they tied me to a
horse, and brought me across a plain of burning sand, where I nearly
perished for want of water, and was nearly sawed in two by the backbone
of the horse I rode.I believed it was a case of gone goose with me.At
last they camped in a wild spot, and I was so badly used up that I could
scarcely eat or do anything but lay around and groan.They seemed to
think there was no need of watching me very closely, and I noticed that
I was alone sometimes.Then, feeling utterly reckless, I began to watch
for a chance to sneak away.I didn't care if I were shot, or if I
escaped and perished from hunger and thirst.I was bound to make the
attempt.A saddleless horse strayed along where I
was, and I made a jump for the animal.Before they knew what I was
doing, I was on the beast's back and yelling into its ears like a
maniac.The horse scooted out of the camp, and I clung on.The bandits
pursued me, and everything else is a haze till I heard Frank calling for
me to jump off.I recognized his voice and fell off the horse, although
I had not the least idea in the world where I was.""Wa'al," chuckled Bushnell, "thet's w'at I call dead fool luck, beggin'
yer pardon fer speakin' so open like, at which I means no harm
whatever.""Oh, ye needn't beg my pardon," quickly said Professor Scotch."I don't
want any credit for getting away.It wasn't a case of brains at all."Breakfast was prepared, and they ate heartily, after which Frank, Hans,
and the professor lay down to sleep, while Bushnell smoked a black pipe.But even Bushnell was not made of iron, and the pipe soothed him to
slumber, so the entire party slept, with no one to guard.All at once, some hours later, they were awakened by an exclamation from
Frank, who sat up and stared at the form of a stranger, the latter being
quietly squatting in their midst, calmly puffing at a cigarette, while
his poncho was wrapped about him to his hips.Frank's exclamation awakened Bushnell like an electric shock, and, even
as his eyes opened, his hand shot out, the fingers grasping the butt of
a revolver that was pointed straight at the stranger."I hev ther drop on yer, an' I'll
sock yer full of lead ef yer wiggle a toenail!The stranger continued smoking, his coal-black eyes being the only part
of him to move, for all of the threatening revolver.Hans sat up, gasping:

"Shimminy Gristmas!Der pandits haf caught us alretty soon!"At this Professor Scotch gave a groan of dismay, faintly gurgling:

"Then I'm a goner!"That the stranger was a half-blood could be seen at a glance."Drap thet cigaroot, an' give an account of yerself instanter right
off!"The cigarette fell from the man's lips, and he answered:

"I am Rodeo.""Wa'al, who is Rodeo?"Professor Scotch groaned again, and rolled a little farther from the
half-blood, but still made no effort to sit up."Wa'al, dern your skin!""You've got a nerve to come
hyar!I s'pose Pacheco an' his gang of onery varmints is within whoopin'
distance?""I am alone; there is no one within call.""Wa'al, w'at be yer hyar fer, thet's what I wants ter know?""I found you asleep, and I came to warn you."Before the sun sinks
behind the mountains they will be here.If you are not gone, you must
all fall into their hands."Bushnell looked doubtful and suspicious, while a puzzled expression came
into his bronzed face."Look hyar," he said; "you're up ter some game, an' I'm derned ef I know
what she am, but yer wants ter understand yer can't monkey with this old
<DW53> none whatever.I hold the drop on yer, Old Socks, an' I may take a
fancy ter bore yer once jest fer fun, so ye'd best talk straight an'
squar', an' be lively about it.""Yah," nodded Hans, threateningly, "you petter peen in a plamed pig
hurry apoudt dot talking pusiness.""What do you wish me to say, senors?""Explain why you're hyar ter warn us.""Because I'm the brother of Pacheco.""Thet don't go down with this old <DW53>.Pacheco is ther leader of ther
bandits.""Oh, say, thet thar won't do--I tells yer it won't, fer we know er
blamed sight better!Rodeo, lying is dangerous with me 'round.""Senor, I do not lie; I tell you the truth.One month ago Pacheco was
the leader of the band; now he is dead, and another is in his place.This other killed him in a battle, and by that he won the right to be
leader of the band.He has taken my brother's name, and he calls himself
Pacheco.Senors, I swear to you I speak the truth--I swear by all the
saints!My brother is dead, and there is an impostor in his place."Frank was impressed, and his hand fell on Bushnell's arm."I believe the fellow really speaks the truth," he said."He seems
sincere, and his eyes are square and steady.""Yer can't tell about ther skunks," muttered the Westerner; "but still
this one does seem ter be layin' a straight trail.""I have taken my oath," continued the half-blood, a red light in his
dark eyes--"I have sworn to kill the murderer of my brother, and I will
keep the oath.I have been watching the band for
two weeks; I know every move they will make.I know when you leave
Huejugilla el Alto, and I know they will follow.I make sure of that,
and then, with my heart full of joy, I ride fast in advance.At last--at
last they go to my country in the mountains!My people are there--my
other brothers, my cousins, my relatives.They will all stand by me, and
they will be ready to avenge Pacheco.The wrath of my people shall fall
on the head of the impostor!You are bound far in the mountains, and the false Pacheco will follow.If you are captured, he may turn back.I want him to follow you--I want
you to lead him into the snare.That is why I am here, and that is why I
have warned you, senors.It is done, and now I will go."He arose to his feet, heedless of Bushnell's command to "keep still,"
and strode toward the horses.They saw an extra animal was there, and,
in a moment, he had flung himself on the creature's back."_Buenos dias, senores._"

A clatter of hoofs, the flutter of a poncho, and a crimson serape, and
Rodeo's horse was galloping up the ravine that still led deeper into the
mountains.Two days later, shortly after sunset, the party camped far in the depths
of the Sierra Madre Mountains.The words of Rodeo, the half-blood, had proved true, for they were
pursued by the bandits, but, thanks to the skill of Bushnell, they had
been able to give the desperadoes the slip."By ther end of another day we oughter be able ter clap our peepers on
ther Silver Palace," declared the Westerner.Professor Scotch was now as eager as any of them to see the wonderful
palace, all his doubts having been dispelled by Bushnell's
straightforward narrative of the discovery of the place by himself and
Jack Burk."I wonder what causes that column of smoke we saw rising amid the
mountains to the westward to-day?""Thet thar has troubled me some," he admitted."It seems ter be fair an'
squar' in ther direction of ther Silver Palace.""Maype dose pandits peen aheadt uf us und purn der balace up," suggested
Hans, with an air of very great wisdom."I scarcely think they would be able to burn a building made of stone,
gold, and silver," smiled Frank."Wa'al, not much," said Bushnell."Ther palace will be thar when we
arrive.They were very tired, and, feeling secure in the depths of a narrow
ravine, they soon slept, with the exception of Frank, who had the first
watch.The moon came up over the mountain peaks, which stood out plainly in the
clear light, every gorge and fissure being cut black as ink, and showing
with wonderful distinctness.The shadow was deep in the narrow ravine, and Frank sat with his back
to a wall of rock, looking upward, when he was startled to see a figure
rise in the bright moonlight.On the brink of the ravine above stood a man who seemed to be peering
down at them.cried this man, in a loud voice.The cry aroused every sleeper, and Bushnell started up with his
Winchester clutched ready for use.Frank clutched his arm, gasping:

"Merciful goodness!look there--look at that man's face!He pointed at the man on the brink of the ravine above them.The light
of the moon fell fairly on the face of this man, which was plainly
revealed to every one of the startled and thunderstruck party.cried the man, with a warning gesture."There have been spies upon you, and Pacheco knows where you have
stopped for the night."Bushnell dropped his rifle, clutching at the neck of his shirt, and
gasping for breath.he shouted, "it's my pard, Jack Burk, or it's his
spook!"gurgled Hans Dunnerwust, quivering with fear."Id vos
der sbook uf der man vot we seen deat as a toornail!"In truth, the man on the brink of the ravine looked like Jack Burk, who
had been declared dead in the adobe hut near Mendoza."It is a resemblance--it must be a resemblance!"Once more the man above uttered a warning:

"You were trailed by a spy," he declared."The spy saw you camp here,
and he has gone to bring Pacheco and the bandits.If you escape, you must move without further delay.""It not only looks like my pard," said Bushnell, hoarsely, "but it has
ther voice of my pard!Ef Jack Burk is dead, thet shore is his spook!"And then, as suddenly as he had appeared, the man above vanished from
view.gasped Professor Scotch, wiping the cold perspiration from his
face."I never took stock in ghosts before, but now----"

"Remember his warning," cut in Frank."Dot vos righd," nodded Hans."Yes, thet's right," agreed Bushnell."We'll git out of hyar in a
howlin' hurry.Ef Jack Burk is dead, then thet wuz his spook come to
warn his old pard."There was saddling and packing in hot haste, and the little party was
soon moving along the ravine.For at least thirty minutes they hastened onward, and then the Westerner
found a place where the horses could climb the sloping wall of the
ravine and get out of the gorge.It was no easy task to make the animals
struggle to the top, but Bushnell succeeded in forcing them all up.When
the party was out of the ravine every one breathed with greater freedom."There," said Frank, "I do not feel as if we might be caught like rats
in a trap."Frank was the last to move from the ravine, and, just as he was about to
do so, he seemed to catch a glimpse of something moving silently in the
darkness."Come here, Bushnell--professor,
Hans, stay with the horses.He flung himself on his face in the shadow of a great bowlder, and
peered down into the darkness below.The Westerner and the professor came creeping to his side.Peering down into the dark depths of the gorge, they saw black figures
flitting silently past, men and horses, as they were able to make out.came cautiously from Frank's lips; "they are riding swiftly,
yet the feet of their horses make no sound!""Mysteries are crowding each other," said Frank.Bushnell was silent, but he was watching and listening.Like a band of black phantoms, the silent horsemen rode along the ravine
and disappeared.Frank could hear the professor's teeth chattering as if
the man had a chill."This bub-bub-beats my tut-tut-tut-time!""I rather
think we'd better turn back and let the Silver Palace alone.""Them varmints wuz Pacheco's gang, an' they hed
the feet of their critters muffled, thet's all.Don't git leery fer
thet.All ther same, ef Jack Burk or his spook hedn't warned us, them
onery skunks w'u'd hed us in a consarned bad trap."This was the truth, as they all knew, and they were decidedly thankful
to the mysterious individual who had warned them.Bushnell now resorted to the trick of "covering the trail," in order to
do which it was necessary to muffle the feet of their horses and lead
them over the rocky ground, where their bandaged hoofs could make no
mark.At length he came to a stream, and he led the way into the water,
following the course of the stream, and having the others trail along in
single file directly behind him.When they halted again Bushnell assured them that there was little
danger that the bandits would be able to follow them closely, and they
rested without molestation till morning.At daybreak the Westerner was astir, being alive with eagerness and
impatience, as he repeatedly declared they would behold the wonderful
Silver Palace before another sunset.Eating a hasty breakfast, they pushed forward, with the Westerner in the
lead.Once more the tower of smoke, which they had noted the day before, was
before them, but now it seemed blacker and more ominous than on the
previous day.It was not far from midday when, away to the westward, they heard
rumbling sounds, like distant thunder."Vot id vas, ain'd id?""I don'd seen no dunder
shower coming up somevere, do I?""It did not seem like thunder," said Frank, soberly."It was more like a
rumbling beneath the ground, and I fancied the earth quivered a bit.""Perhaps it is an earthquake," put in the professor, apprehensively."I
believe they have such convulsions of nature in this part of the world."Bushnell said nothing, but there was a troubled look on his face, and he
urged them all forward at a still swifter pace.The smoke tower was now looming near at hand, and they could see it
shift and sway, grow thin, and roll up in a dense, black mass.It cast a
gloom over their spirits, and made them all feel as if some frightful
disaster was impending.Again and again, at irregular intervals, they heard the sullen rumbling,
and once all were positive the earth shook.It was noticed that directly after each rumbling the smoke rolled up in
a thick, black mass that shut out the light of the sun and overcast the
heavens.The professor was for turning back, but Bushnell was determined to go
forward, and Frank was equally resolute.Hans had very little to say,
but his nerves were badly shaken."In less than an hour we shall be able to see the Silver Palace,"
assured Bushnell."We would be fools to turn back now."So they went on, and, at last, they climbed to the top of a rise, from
which point the Westerner assured them that the palace could be seen.An awe-inspiring spectacle met their gaze.They looked across a great
gulf, from which the smoke was rolling upward in clouds, and out of
which came the sullen mutterings they had heard."It must be the crater of a
volcano!"gasped Hans; "und der volcano vos doin' pusiness at der oldt
standt alretty yet.""The volcano may have been dormant for centuries," said the professor,
"but it is coming to life now!"Bushnell clutched the boy's arm with a grip of iron, pointing straight
through the smoke clouds that rose before them.he shouted, hoarsely; "it is thar!See--the smoke grows thinner,
an' thar she am!In thet thar palace is stored enough
treasure ter make us richer then ther richest men in ther world, an' ten
thousand volcanoes ain't goin' ter keep me from it, you bet yer boots!"True enough, through the parted smoke clouds gleamed the towers and
turrets of the wonderful palace that had remained hidden in the heart of
the mountains hundreds of years, jealously guarded by the fierce
natives, who believed it sacred, and who had kept the secret well from
the outside world.Bushnell leaped from his horse and began tearing the packs from the
backs of the led animals.He worked with mad haste, and there was an
awesome, insane glare in his eyes."The volcano is certain to
break forth before long--it must be on the verge of breaking forth now."I vos retty to gone righd avay queek."The professor turned to Frank with his appeal:

"Come, boy, let's get away before destruction comes upon us.Frank sprang down from his snorting horse, flung the rein to Hans, and
leaped to Bushnell's side."You are mad to think of remaining here!""Come away,
and we will return when the volcano is at peace."thundered the treasure-seeker, "I will not go!The Silver Palace
is there, and I mean to have my share of the treasure.Go if you are
afraid, but here I stay till the balloon is inflated, and I can cross
the chasm.The wind is right for it, and nothing shall stop me!"He picketed the horses, and began ripping open the packs.Frank turned to Professor Scotch, saying, quietly:

"Bushnell will not go, and I shall stay with him.At the same time, I
advise you to go.Take Hans with you, and get away from here.Leave a
plain trail, and Bushnell will be able to follow it, if we succeed in
reaching the palace and returning alive."The professor entreated Frank to change his mind, but the lad was
determined, and nothing could alter that determination.At last Scotch gave up in despair, groaning:

"If you stay, I stay.I am your guardian, but you seem to have things
all your own way.If this volcano cooks us all, you will be to blame for
it."Frank said no word, but went about the task of assisting Bushnell in the
work of inflating the balloon.The Westerner had a "gas generator," which he was getting in order.As
soon as this was ready, the balloon was unrolled, spread out, drawn up
by means of poles and lines, and then secured to the ground by one stout
rope, which was hitched about the base of a great bowlder.Then Bushnell built a fire and set the "gas generator" at work.In the meantime the volcano had continued to mutter.At intervals the
clouds of smoke parted, and they saw the wonderful Silver Palace
standing on a plateau beyond the chasm.The palace seemed to cast a spell over them all, and they felt the fever
of the gold-hunter beginning to burn in their throbbing veins.It was more than an hour after their arrival that the balloon began to
fill with gas and Frank uttered a cheer as he saw the silk bulging like
a bladder that is inflated with wind."In a few minutes we'll go sailin'
over ther gulf, right through ther smoke, ter ther Silver Palace.The man's face was flushed till it was nearly purple, and his eyes were
bloodshot.The fever had fastened itself firmly upon him.Bushnell had brought out a folding
car, which he securely attached."In ten minutes more we'll be ready for the trip!"At that instant a series of wild cries reached their ears, and, turning
swiftly, they saw a band of dark-faced men pouring through a fissure in
the rocks to the north of them.cried Hans Dunnerwust, in terror.cried Bushnell, hastily securing his rifle."Ther pizen varmints hev come ten minutes too soon!Ther balloon would
take us all over in another ten minutes, but now it won't carry more
than two.We must hold ther skunks off till she fills.""And we must be ready to go the
instant she does fill.We can't hold 'em back long, for we have no
shelter here.Get in, I say, and be
ready!We'll try to stand the whelps off till the balloon is inflated,
but we must be ready to start at any instant."Professor Scotch and Hans were hastily bundled into the car.The bandits hesitated long enough to gather and prepare for the charge,
with their chief in the lead.It was plain they saw the treasure-seekers
had no shelter, and they meant to close in without delay.called Bushnell, dropping on one knee, his
Winchester in his hands.With mad cries and a fusillade of shots, the bandits
charged.Bushnell opened fire, and Frank followed his example.Several of the
bandits were seen to fall, but still the others came on."It'll be hand ter hand in
a jiffy.""And that means----"

"We'll get wiped out.""The balloon----"

"Won't carry more'n two--possibly three.It don't make any diffrunce 'bout an old <DW53> like me.""Not much will I get in and leave you!""We are partners in
this expedition, and partners we'll stay to the end!""But ther others--ther professor an' ther Dutch boy!They might escape
if----"

"They shall escape!"Out flashed a knife in Frank Merriwell's hand, and, with one sweeping
slash, he severed the strong rope that held the tugging, tossing balloon
to the earth.Away shot the balloon, a cry of amazement and horror
breaking from the lips of the professor and Hans."I'll tell you," groaned the professor."The balloon could not carry all
four of us, and Frank Merriwell, like the noble, generous, hot-headed,
foolish boy he is, refused to leave Bushnell.At the same time he would
not doom us, and he cut the rope, setting the balloon free.He has
remained behind to die at Bushnell's side.""I vant to go pack und die mit him!"We are directly over the Silver
Palace!What a beautiful----"

The professor's words were interrupted by a frightful rumbling roar that
came up from the gulf surrounding the plateau on which the palace stood.All the way around that gulf a sheet of flame seemed to leap upward
through smoke, and then, paralyzed, helpless, hypnotized by the
spectacle, they saw the plateau and the palace sink and disappear into
the blackness of a great void.Then, like a black funeral pall, the
smoke rolled up about them and shut off their view.But they knew that never again would the eyes of any human being behold
the marvelous Silver Palace of the Sierra Madre Mountains.When the balloon had ascended higher another current of air was
encountered, and the course changed.Away they floated over the mountain
peaks and out beyond the great range.At last they came down, made a safe landing, and, to their satisfaction,
found themselves within a mile of Huejugilla el Alto.They had escaped the most frightful perils, but Professor Scotch's heart
lay like lead in his bosom, and Hans Dunnerwust was not to be comforted,
for they had left Frank Merriwell to his doom.In Huejugilla el Alto they remained four days, neither of them seeming
to have energy enough to do anything.And, on the fourth day, Frank, Al Bushnell, and two others rode into
town and stopped at the hotel.Hans shed nearly a
bucketful of joyful tears, and Professor Scotch actually swooned from
sheer amazement and delight.When the professor recovered, he clung to
Frank's hands, saying:

"This is the happiest moment of my life--if I am not dreaming!Frank, my
dear boy, I never expected to see you again."The eruption of the volcano broke the bandits up," explained Frank;
"and, by the time they had recovered and were ready to come at us again,
a band of natives, headed by Rodeo, Pacheco's brother, came down on
them.The bandits were defeated, many of them
slain, among the latter being the false Pacheco.And whom do you fancy
the impostor proved to be, professor?""He was my villainous cousin, Carlos Merriwell.""No, I shall never be troubled by him again.With Rodeo and the natives
was Jack Burk----"

"Jack Burk!"Not quite, professor," declared a familiar voice, and Burk himself
stepped forward."I am still quite lively for a dead man.""You saw me nearly dead, but not quite.You remember I told you of a
native who had found me in the hut, and how he had said it was not a
fever that ailed me, but was a trouble brought on by drinking the water
of the spring near the hut?""And I told you the native hastily left me--left me to die alone, as I
supposed.""He did not leave me to die, but went for an antidote.While you were
away he returned and administered some of the antidote for the poison,
bringing me around, although but a feeble spark of life fluttered in my
bosom.Then he took me on his shoulders, and carried me from the hut to
another place of shelter, where he brought me back to my full strength
in a remarkably brief space of time.""I understand why we did not find you," said the professor."We followed the bandits," Jack Burk continued."This native was Rodeo,
the brother of the true Pacheco, and he is here."Rodeo stepped forward, bowing with the politeness of a Spanish don."Rodeo made me swear to aid him in hunting down the murderer of his
brother.That was the pay he asked for saving my life.I gave the oath,
and it was his whim that I should not reveal myself to you till the
right time came.But when I saw the spy tracking you, saw him locate
you, and saw him hasten to tell the bandits, I was forced to appear and
give a warning.""I thought it possible you might, and I fancied that might cause you to
give all the more heed to the warning.""Well, of all remarkable things that ever happened in my life, these
events of the past few days take the lead," declared Scotch."However, I
have come through all dangers in safety, and I am happy, for Frank is
alive and well.""But the Silver Palace is gone, with all its marvelous treasure," said
Frank."Thet's right, boy," nodded Bushnell, gloomily."Ther palace has sunk
inter ther earth, an' nary galoot ever gits ther benefit of all ther
treasure it contained.""Don't take it so hard, partner," said Jack Burk."Mexico is the land of
treasures, and we may strike something else before we cross the Death
Divide.""Vell," sighed Hans Dunnerwust, "you beoples can hunt for dreasure all
you don'd vant to; but I haf enough uf dis pusiness alretty soon.I
nefer vos puilt for so much oxcitemend, und I vos goin' to took der next
drain for home as soon as I can ged to him.Uf I don'd done dot I vos
afrait mein mutter vill nefer seen her leedle Hansie some more.""I fancy I have had quite enough of Mexico for the present," smiled
Frank."The United States will do me a while longer, and so, if you are
going home, Hans, Professor Scotch and myself will accompany you till we
strike Uncle Sam's domain, at least."A few days later, bidding their friends adieu, they left Mexico, taking
their way northward to New Orleans, where new adventures awaited them,
as the chapters to follow will prove.It was the day before Mardi Gras in New Orleans, and the "Queen City of
the South" was in her gayest attire, being thronged with visitors from
the North and from almost every part of the world.It was Monday, when Rex, king of the carnival, comes to town and takes
possession of the city.Early in the forenoon the river front in the vicinity of Canal Street
was thronged with people seeking advantageous positions from which to
witness the king's landing.It was a jovial, good-natured gathering, such as is never seen in any
other city.Every one seemed to have imbibed the spirit of the occasion,
and there was no friction or unpleasantness.Every one was exceedingly
polite and courteous, and all seemed to feel it a duty to make the
occasion as pleasant for other folks as possible.The shipping along the river was decorated, and flags flew everywhere.The sun never shone more brightly and New Orleans never presented more
subtle allurements.Seated in a private carriage that had stopped at a particularly
favorable spot were Professor Scotch and Frank, who had arrived a few
days before."Professor," said Frank, who was almost bursting with pent-up enthusiasm
and youthful energy, "this makes a fellow feel that it is good to be
living.In all the places we have visited, I have seen nothing like
this.I am sorry Hans is no longer with us to enjoy it.""And you will see nothing like it anywhere in this country but right
here," declared the professor, who was also enthused."Northern cities
may get up carnivals, but they allow the spirit of commerce to crowd in
and push aside the true spirit of pleasure.In all their pageants and
processions may be seen schemes for advertising this, that or the other;
but here you will see nothing of the kind.In the procession to-day and
the parade to-morrow, you will see no trade advertisements, no schemes
for calling attention to Dr.Somebody-or-other's cure for ingrowing
corns, nothing but the beautiful and the artistic.""It's seldom you speak like this, professor," he said."You must be in
love with the South.""I am a Northerner, but I think the South very beautiful, and I admire
the people of the South more than I can tell.I do not know as they are
naturally more gentle and kind-hearted than Northerners, but they are
certainly more courteous and chivalrous, despite their quick tempers and
more passionate dispositions.Northerners are too brusque.If they ask
pardon for rudeness, they do it as if they regretted the breath spent in
uttering the words.It is quite the opposite with Southerners, for they
seem----"

"Hold on, professor," interrupted Frank."You may tell me all about that
some other time.There was a stir among the people, a murmur ran over the great throng.Then the royal yacht, accompanied by more than a dozen other steamers,
all gayly decorated, was seen approaching.The great crowd began to cheer, hundreds of whistles shrieked and roared
at the same instant, bands of music were playing, and, as the royal
yacht drew near the levee at the foot of Canal Street, the booming of
cannons added to the mad uproar of joy.All over the great gathering of gayly dressed people handkerchiefs
fluttered and hats were waved in the air, while laughing, excited faces
were seen everywhere.The mad excitement filled Frank Merriwell's veins, and he stood erect in
the carriage, waving his hat and cheering with the cheering thousands,
although there was such an uproar at that moment that he could scarcely
hear his own voice.The king, attired in purple and gold, was seen near the bow of the royal
yacht, surrounded by courtiers and admirers.To Frank's wonder, a dozen policemen had been able to keep Canal Street
open for the procession from the levee as far as could be seen.Elsewhere, and on each side of the street, the throng packed thickly,
but they seemed to aid the police in the work of holding the street
clear, so there was no trouble at all.Not once had Frank seen the
pushing and swaying so often seen when great crowds assemble in Northern
cities, and not once had the policemen been compelled to draw a club to
enforce orders.As the royal yacht drew into the jetty a gathering of city officers and
leading citizens formed to greet and welcome him.These gentlemen were
known as "dukes of the realm," and constituted the royal court.They
were decorated with badges of gold and bogus jewels.The yacht drew up at the levee, and King Rex, accompanied by his escort,
landed, where he was greeted with proper ceremony by the dukes of the
realm.Then the king was provided with a handsomely decorated carriage, which
he entered, and a procession was formed.The king's carriage somewhat
resembled a chariot, being drawn by four mettlesome coal-black horses,
all gayly caparisoned with gold and silver trimmings and nodding plumes.A magnificent band of music headed the procession, and then came a barge
that was piled high with beautiful and fragrant flowers.In this barge
was a girl who seemed to be dressed entirely in flowers, and there was a
crown of flowers on her head.She was masked, but did not seem to be
more than sixteen or seventeen years of age.She was known as "the Queen of Flowers," and other girls, ladies of the
court, dressed entirely in white, accompanied her.The king's carriage followed the flower barge, and, directed by the
queen, who was seated on a throne of flowers, the girls scattered
flowers beneath the feet of the horses, now and then laughingly pelting
some one in the throng with them.As the procession started, the cannons boomed once more, and the steam
whistles shrieked.And then, in less than a minute, there came a startling interruption.The cheering of the people on one of the side streets turned to shrieks
of terror and warning, and the crowd was seen to make a mad rush for
almost any place of shelter."Don't know," was the reply, as Frank mounted to the carriage seat, on
which he stood to obtain a view."Why, it seems that there are wild
cattle in the street, and they're coming this way.""Drive on, driver--get out of the
way quickly!""That's impossible, sir," replied the driver, immediately."If I drive
on, we are liable to be overturned by the rushing crowd.It is safer to
keep still and remain here.""Those cattle look like Texas long-horns!""So they are, sir," assured the driver."They have broken out of the
yard in which they were placed this morning.They were brought here on a
steamer.""Texas long-horns on a stampede in a crowded city!""That means damage--no end of it."In truth, nearly half a hundred wild Texan steers, driven to madness by
the shrieking whistles and thundering cannons, had broken out of the
fraily constructed yard, and at least a dozen of them had stampeded
straight toward Canal Street.Persons crushed against each other and fell over each other in frantic
haste to get out of the way for the cattle to pass.Some were thrown
down and trampled on by the fear-stricken throng.Men shouted hoarsely,
and women shrieked.Mad with terror, blinded by dust, furious with the joy of sudden
freedom, the Texan steers, heads lowered, horns glistening, eyes glowing
redly and nostrils steaming, charged straight into the crowd."For Heaven's sake, is there no way of stopping those creatures?"Into Canal Street rushed the crowd, and the procession was broken up in
a moment.The one thought of everybody seemed to be to get out of the
way of the steers.The horses on the flower barge became unmanageable, turned short,
snorting with terror, and upset the barge, spilling flowers, girls, and
all into the street.Then, in some way, the animals broke away, leaving
the wrecked barge where it had toppled.The girls, with one exception, sprang up and fled in every direction.The one exception was the Queen of Flowers, who lay motionless and
apparently unconscious in the street, with the beautiful flowers piled
on every side of her."Why doesn't some one
pick her up?""They do not see her there amid the flowers," palpitated the professor."They do not know she has not fled with the other girls!""The cattle--the steers will crush her!"Professor Scotch made a clutch at the lad, but too late to catch and
hold him.Frank leaped from the carriage, clearing the heads of a dozen persons,
struck on his feet in the street, tore his way through the rushing,
excited mob, and reached the side of the unconscious Flower Queen.He
lifted her from the ground, and, at that very instant, a mad steer, with
lowered head and bristling horns, charged blindly at them!A cry of horror went up from those who beheld the peril of the brave boy
and the Queen of Flowers, for it looked as if both must be impaled by
the wicked horns of the mad steer.Well it was that Frank was a lad of nerve, with whom at such a moment to
think was to act.Well it was that he had the muscles and strength of a
trained athlete.Frank did not drop the girl to save himself, as most lads would have
done.She felt no heavier than a feather in his arms, but it seemed that
he would be unable to save himself, if he were unincumbered.Had he leaped ahead he could not have escaped.With all the energy he
possessed, he sprang backward, at the same time swinging the girl away
from the threatening horns, so that his own body protected her in case
he was not beyond reach of the steer.In such a case and in such a situation inches count, and it proved thus
in this instance.One of the steer's horns caught Frank's coat sleeve at the shoulder, and
ripped it open to the flesh as far as his elbow, the sharp point seeming
to slit the cloth like a keen knife.But Frank was unharmed, and the unconscious girl was not touched.Then the steer crashed into the flower barge.Frank was not dazed by his remarkable escape, and he well knew the peril
might not be over.Like a leaping panther, the boy sprang from the spot, avoiding other mad
steers and frantic men and women, darted here and there through the
flying throng, and reached a place where he believed they would be safe.It was a brave and nervy act--the act of a true hero.The stampeded steers dashed on, and the danger at that point was past.Men and women had been trampled and bruised, but, remarkable though it
seemed, when the steers were finally captured or dispatched, it was
found that no person had been killed outright.The lad had placed the girl
upon some steps, and he called for water.They were eager to see her face, that they might again recognize the
girl who had passed through such peril.Frank hesitated, although he also longed to look on the face of the girl
he had saved.She was most beautifully formed for a girl of her age, and
that her face was pretty he had not a doubt.He reached out his hand to unfasten the mask.As he did so his wrist was
clutched by strong fingers, and a panting voice hissed in his ear:

"Would you do it?I will take charge of that young
lady, if you please!"Looking over his shoulder, Frank saw the dark, excited face of a youth
of twenty or twenty-one.That face was almost wickedly handsome,
although there was something decidedly repellent about it.The eyes were
black as midnight, while the lips were full and red.he said, calmly--"who are you?""One who knows this unfortunate young lady, and has a right to protect
her.""Which is ver' true, sah," declared a man with a bristling white
mustache and imperial, who stood just behind the youth with the dark
face."I give you my word of honah, sah, that it is true."The words were spoken with great suavity and politeness, and Frank noted
that the speaker seemed to have a military air.Frank hesitated, and then straightened up, stepping back and bowing, as
he said:

"That settles it, gentlemen.If you know the young lady, I have nothing
more to say."The young man instantly lifted the Flower Queen in his arms.As he did
so she opened her eyes, and Frank saw she was looking straight at his
face.Then came a staggering surprise for the boy from the North.He saw the
girl's lips part, and he distinctly heard her faintly exclaim:

"Frank Merriwell!"Frank fell back a step, then started forward.Quick as a flash, the youth with the dark face passed the girl to the
man with the white mustache and imperial, and the latter bore her
through the throng to a carriage.Frank would have followed, but the dark-faced youth blocked the way,
saying, harshly:

"Hold on!"She knows me--she spoke
my name!Frank measured the other from head to heels with his eyes."Now, don't go to putting on any airs with me, my smart youngster.By
sheer luck, you were able to save her from possible injury.Like all
Northerners, you have your price for every service."You say 'like all Northerners,' but it is well for the South that you
are not a representative Southerner.You are an insolent cad and a
puppy!"hissed the youth with the dark face.Quickly he leaned forward and struck Frank's cheek with his open hand.Like a bolt, Frank's fist shot out and caught the other under the chin,
hurling him backward into the arms of a man behind him, where he lay
gasping and dazed.Frank would have rushed toward the carriage, but he saw it move swiftly
away, carrying the mysterious Queen of Flowers, and, with deep regret,
he realized he was too late.The man with the bristling white mustache and imperial did not depart in
the carriage, but he again forced his way through the crowd, and found
his companion slowly recovering from the stunning blow he had received."Mistah Raymon', sah, what does this mean?""It means that I have been insulted and struck!"hissed the one
questioned, quivering with unutterable anger.cried the man, in unbounded amazement."This young coxcomb of a Northern cur!"The man glared at Frank, who, with his hands on his hips, was quietly
awaiting developments, apparently not at all alarmed.He did not quail
in the least before the fierce, fire-eating look given him by the man
with the bristling mustache and imperial."If this--ah!--young gentleman struck you, Mistah Raymon', sah, there
can be but one termination of the affaiah.He will have to meet you,
sah, on the field, or humbly apologize at once.""I'll have his life,
or an instant apology!""As I happen to feel that I am the one to whom an apology is due, you
will have to be satisfied with taking my life," he said.The youth with the dark face drew out a handsome card case, from which
he extracted an engraved card, which he haughtily handed to Frank, who
accepted it, and read aloud:

"'Mr.You will be able to find me
without difficulty.""Rest assured that a friend of mine will call on you without delay, Mr.Merriwell," stiffly said Raymond, thrusting Frank's card into his
pocket.Professor Scotch had forced his way through the crowd in time to catch
the drift of this, and the full significance of it dawned upon him,
filling him with amazement and horror."This will not do--it will never do!""Dueling is a thing
of the past; there is a law for it!Frank, you
hot-headed young rascal, what do you mean by getting into such a
scrape?""Keep cool, professor," said the boy, calmly."If this young gentleman
insists on forcing me into a duel, I cannot take water--I must give him
satisfaction.""I tell you I won't have it!"roared the little man, in his big, hoarse
voice, his face getting very red.You are a minor,
and I forbid you to fight a duel.""If Mistah Merriwell will apologize, it is possible that, considering
his age, sah, Mistah Raymon' will not press this mattah," smoothly said
the man with the bristling mustache."He struck Mistah Raymon', sah."roared the professor, getting very red in the face."Well,
I don't think you'll apologize, Frank, and you're not going to fight.You're a boy; let him take a man.If he wants to fight anybody, I'm just
his hairpin, and I'll agree to do him up with any kind of a weapon from
a broad-ax to a bologna sausage!"MYSTERY OF THE FLOWER QUEEN.Frank looked at Professor Scotch in amazement, for he had never known
the little man to use such language or show such spirit in the face of
actual danger."I wonder if the professor has been drinking, and, if so, where he got
his drinks?"was the thought that flashed through Frank's mind."Mistah Raymon', sah, has no quarrel with you, sah," said the individual
with the bristling mustache."If there is to be any further trouble,
sah, I will attend to your case.""I, sah, am Colonel La Salle Vallier, the ver' particular friend of
Mistah Raymon'.If yo' say so, we will exchange cards, sah.""And here, sah, is mine.""This," said Colonel Vallier, "precludes yo' from interfering in this
othah affair, Professor Scotch."How's that, I'd like to know?""I am at your service, professor," bowed the colonel."You shall make
such arrangements as yo' choose.Pistols or swords make no difference to
me, for I am a dead shot and an expert swordsman.I trust yo' will
excuse us now, gentlemen.He locked arms with the young man, and they turned away, with a sweeping
salute.The throng parted, and they passed through.Professor Scotch stood staring after them till Frank tapped him on the
shoulder, saying:

"Come, professor, we may as well get out of this.""Excuse-a me, senors," said a soft, musical voice, and a young man with
a Spanish face and pink cheeks was bowing before them."I t'ink you
need-a to be tole 'bout it."demanded Frank, who took an instant dislike to this
softly smiling fellow with the womanish voice and gentle ways."Excuse-a me," repeated the stranger, who was gaudily dressed in many
colors."Yo' are strangar-a-rs from de Noath, an' yo' do not know-a de
men what you have a de troub' wid.Excuse-a me; I am Manuel Mazaro, an'
I know-a dem.De young man is son of de ver' reech Senor Roderick
Raymon', dat everybody in New Orle'n know.He is ver' wile--ver'
reckless.He love-a to fight, an' he has been in two duel, dough he
is ver' young.But de odare, senors--de man wid de white mustache--ah!"Manuel Mazaro threw up his hands with an expression that plainly said
words failed him."Senors," purred Mazaro, "he is de wor-r-rst fightar ever leeve!He
like-a to fight fo' de sport of keelin'.Take-a my advice, senors, an'
go 'way from New Orle'n'.Yo' make ver' gre't mistake to get in troub'
wid dem.""Thank you for your kind advice," said Frank, quietly."I presume it is
well meant, but it is wasted.This is a free country, and a dozen
fire-eaters like Colonel La Salle Vallier and Mr.Rolf Raymond cannot
drive us out of New Orleans till we are ready to go.rumbled the little man, stiffening up and looking
as fierce as he could."Oh, ver' well, ver' well," said Mazaro, lifting his eyebrows, the ghost
of a scornful smile on his face."You know-a your own biz.They passed through the crowd and sought their carriage, which was
waiting for them, although the driver had begun to think they had
deserted him.The procession, which had been broken up by the stampeded steers, was
again forming, making it evident that the pleasure-loving people were
determined that the unfortunate occurrence should not ruin the day.The Queen of Flowers and her subjects had vanished, and the flower barge
was a wreck, so a part of the programme could not be carried out.The procession formed without the flower barge, and was soon on its way
once more, the band playing its liveliest tune.The way was lined with tens of thousands of spectators, while flags
fluttered from every building.All along the line the king was greeted
with cheers and bared heads.The carriage bearing Frank and the professor had found a place in the
procession through the skill of the driver, and the man and boy were
able to witness this triumphal entrance of King Rex to the Crescent
City.At the City Hall, the Duke of Crescent City, who was the mayor, welcomed
Rex with great pomp and ceremony, presenting him the keys and the
freedom of the city.Shortly afterward, the king mysteriously disappeared, and the procession
broke up and dispersed.Charles Hotel, both feeling
decidedly hungry.Frank had little to say after they had satisfied their hunger and were
in their suite of rooms.He had seemed to be thinking all the while, and
the professor again repeated a question that he had asked several times:

"What in the world makes you so glum, Frank?"The Queen of Flowers," was the reply."My boy," cried the professor, enthusiastically, "I am proud of
you--yes, sir, proud!But, at one time, I thought you were done for.That steer was right upon you, and I could see no way for you to escape
the creature's horns.I held my breath, expecting to see you impaled.And then I saw you escape with no further injury than the slitting of
your coat sleeve, but to this minute I can't say how you did it."Frank scarcely seemed to hear the professor's words.He sat with his
hand to his head, his eyes fixed on a pattern in the carpet."Now, what are you mumbling about?""You saved her life
at the risk of your own, but you don't know her from Adam.""She was when I saved her from the steer.""Yes; just as Colonel Vallier was taking her to the carriage."First I saw her open her eyes, and I noticed that she was looking
straight at me; then I heard her distinctly but faintly pronounce my
name.""You were excited, my boy, and you imagined it.""No, professor, it was no case of imagination; I know she called me
Frank Merriwell, but what puzzles me is the fact that this young cad,
Raymond, was determined I should not speak with her, and she was carried
away quickly.Why should they wish to keep us from having a few words of
conversation?""That is a question I cannot answer, Frank.""There's a mystery here, professor--a mystery I mean to solve.I am
going to find out who the Queen of Flowers really is.""And get into more trouble, you hot-headed young rascal.I should think
you were in trouble enough already, with a possible duel impending."A twinkle of mischief showed in Frank's eyes."Oh, the young scoundrel won't dare to meet me," blustered Scotch,
throwing out his chest and strutting about the room."But he is not the one you will have to meet.You exchanged cards with
Colonel La Salle Vallier.""That might go in the North, but you exchanged under peculiar
circumstances, and, taking everything into consideration, I have no
doubt but you will be waited on by a friend of Colonel Vallier."Is it possible that such a
result will come from a mere matter of politeness?Why, I'm no fighter,
Frank--I'm no blood-and-thunder ruffian!I did not mean to hint that I
wished to meet the colonel on the field of honor.""But you have, and you can't back out now.You heard what Manuel Mazaro
had to say about him.He is a dead shot and a skilled swordsman.Oh,
professor, my heart bleeds for you!But you shall have a great funeral,
and I'll plant tiddly-wink posies all over your grave."groaned Scotch, collapsing on a chair, and looking very
ill indeed.I fear I am
going to be very ill."PROFESSOR SCOTCH FEELS ILL.Frank found it impossible to restrain his laughter longer, and he gave
way to it.I'd
like to have your picture now!It would make a first-rate
picture for a comic paper.""This is no laughing matter," came dolefully from Scotch."I don't know
how to fire a pistol, and I never had a sword in my hand in all my life.And to think of standing up and being shot full of holes or carved like
a turkey by that fire-eater with the fierce mustache!"But you were eager to fight the young fellow."I was simply putting up a bluff, as you call it.I was
doing my level best to get you out of the scrape, Frank.I didn't think
he would fight me, and so I pretended to be eager to meet him.And now
see what a scrape I am in!"I don't see how you can get out of it.""That is impossible, professor," he said, with the utmost apparent
sincerity.It would be in all the papers that
Professor Scotch, a white-livered Northerner, after insulting Colonel La
Salle Vallier and presenting his card, had taken to his heels in the
most cowardly fashion, and had fled from the city without giving the
colonel the satisfaction that is due from one gentleman to another.The
Northern papers would copy, and you would find yourself the butt of
ridicule wherever you went."The professor let out a groan that was more dismal and doleful than any
sound that had previously issued from his lips."There is one way to get out of the difficulty.""Can you joke when I am
suffering such misery?"His face was covered with perspiration, and he was all a-quiver, so that
Frank was really touched.I don't know that I have done anything to apologize
for; but then I'll apologize rather than fight.""Well, I guess you'll be able to get out of it some way."But it was no easy thing to reassure the agitated man, as Frank soon
discovered."I'll tell you what, professor," said the boy; "you may send a
representative--a substitute.""I don't think it will be easy to find a substitute.""Perhaps Colonel Vallier will not accept him.""But you must be too ill to meet the colonel, and then he'll have to
accept the substitute or nothing."I don't know any one in New Orleans
who'll go and be shot in my place.""Barney Mulloy has agreed to join us here, and he may arrive on any
train," went on Frank, mentioning an old school chum."Why, he'd fight a
pack of wildcats and think it fun!""Yes, Barney is happiest when in trouble.According to my uncle's will,
I am at liberty to carry a companion besides my guardian on my travels,
and so, when Hans Dunnerwust got tired of traveling and went home, I
sent for Barney, knowing he'd be a first-class fellow to have with me.He finally succeeded in making arrangements to join us, and I have a
telegram from him, stating that he would start in time to reach here
before to-morrow.If you are forced into trouble, professor, Barney can
serve as a substitute.""That sounds very well, but Colonel Vallier would not accept a boy.""Then Barney can disguise himself and pretend to be a man."Not that Barney Mulloy will hesitate to help
me out of the scrape, for he was the most dare-devil chap in Fardale
Academy, next to yourself, Frank.You were the leader in all kinds of
daring adventures, but Barney made a good second.But he can't pass
muster as a man."But you have not yet received a challenge from Colonel
Vallier; so don't worry about what may not happen."I shall not take any further pleasure in life
till we get out of this dreadful city."Come on; let's go out and see the sights.""No, Frank--no, my boy.I am indisposed--I am quite ill.Besides that, I
might meet Colonel Vallier.I shall remain in my room for the present."So Frank was obliged to go out alone, and, when he returned for supper,
he found the professor in bed, looking decidedly like a sick man."I am very ill, Frank--very ill," Scotch declared."I fear I am in for a
protracted illness."Why, you'll miss all the fun to-morrow, and we're
here to see the sport."I wish we had stayed away from this miserable
place!""Why, you were very enthusiastic over New Orleans and the people of the
South this morning.""Hang the people of the South--hang them all!They're too
hot-headed--they're altogether too ready to fight over nothing.Now, I'm
a peaceable man, and I can't fight--I simply can't!"I don't fancy you'll have to fight," said Frank, whose
conscience was beginning to smite him."Then I'll have to apologize, and I'll be jiggered if I know what I'm
going to apologize for!""What makes you so sure you'll have to apologize?"The professor drew an envelope from beneath his pillow and passed it to
Frank.The envelope contained a note, which the boy was soon reading.It
was from Colonel Vallier, and demanded an apology, giving the professor
until the following noon in which to make it, and hinting that a meeting
of honor would surely follow if the apology was not forthcoming."I scarcely thought the colonel would press the affair.""There's a letter for you on the table."Frank picked up the letter and tore it open.It proved to be from Rolf
Raymond, and was worded much like the note to Professor Scotch.The warm blood of anger mounted to the boy's cheeks.Rolf Raymond shall have all the
fight he wants.I am a good pistol shot and more than a fair swordsman.At Fardale I was the champion with the foils.If he thinks I am a coward
and a greenhorn because I come from the North, he may find he has made a
serious mistake.""But you may be killed, and I'd never forgive myself," he moaned."Killed or not, I can't show the white feather!""Nor do I, but I have found it necessary to do some things I do not
believe in.I am not going to run, and I am not going to apologize, for
I believe an apology is due me, if any one.This being the case, I'll
have to fight.""Oh, what a scrape--what a dreadful scrape!"groaned Scotch, wringing
his hands."We have been in
worse scrapes than this, and you were not so badly broken up.It was
only a short time ago down in Mexico that Pacheco's bandits hemmed us in
on one side and there was a raging volcano on the other; but still we
live and have our health.I'll guarantee we'll pull through this scrape,
and I'll bet we come out with flying colors.""You may feel like meeting Rolf Raymond, but I simply can't stand up
before that fire-eating colonel.""There seems to be considerable bluster about this business, and I'll
wager something you won't have to stand up before him if you will put on
a bold front and make-believe you are eager to meet him.""Oh, my boy, you don't know--you can't tell!""Come, professor, get out of bed and dress.We want to see the parade
this evening."Oh, I wish the parades were all at the bottom of the sea!""We couldn't see them then, for we're not mermaids or fishes.""I don't know; perhaps I may, when I'm too sick to be otherwise."I don't care for the old parade.""Well, I do, and I'm going to see it.""Will you see some newspaper reporters and state that I am very
ill--dangerously ill--that I am dying.Colonel Vallier can't force a dying man to meet him in a duel.""I am shocked and pained, professor, that you should wish me to tell a
lie, even to save your life; but I'll see what I can do for you."Frank ate alone, and went forth alone to see the parade.The professor
remained in bed, apparently in a state of utter collapse.The night after Mardi Gras in New Orleans the Krewe of Proteus holds its
parade and ball.The parade is a most dazzling and magnificent
spectacle, and the ball is no less splendid.The streets along which the parade must pass were lined with a dense
mass of people on both sides, while windows and balconies were filled.It consisted of a series of elaborate and gorgeous floats, the whole
forming a line many blocks in length.Hundreds of flaring torches threw their lights over the moving
_tableau_, and it was indeed a splendid dream.Never before had Frank seen anything of the kind one-half as beautiful,
and he was sincerely glad they had reached the Crescent City in time to
be present at Mardi Gras.The stampede of the Texan steers and the breaking up of the parade that
day had made a great sensation in New Orleans.Every one had heard of
the peril of the Flower Queen, and how she was rescued by a handsome
youth who was said to be a visitor from the North, but whom nobody
seemed to know.Now, the Krewe of Proteus was composed entirely of men, and it was their
policy to have nobody but men in their parade.These men were to dress
as fairies of both sexes, as they were required to appear in the
_tableau_ of "Fairyland."But the managers of the affair had conceived the idea that it would be a
good scheme to reconstruct the wrecked flower barge and have the Queen
of Flowers in the procession.But the Queen of Flowers seemed to be a mystery to every one, and the
managers knew not how to reach her.They made many inquiries, and it
became generally known that she was desired for the procession.Late in the afternoon the managers received a brief note, purporting to
be from the Flower Queen, assuring them that she would be on hand to
take part in the evening parade.The flower barge was put in repair, and piled high with the most
gorgeous and dainty flowers, and, surmounting all, was a throne of
flowers.Before the time for starting the mysterious masked queen and her
attendants in white appeared.When the procession passed along the streets the queen was recognized
everywhere, and the throngs cheered her loudly.But, out of the thousands, hundreds were heard to say:

"Where is the strange youth who saved her from the mad steer?He should
be on the same barge."Frank's heart leaped as he saw the mysterious girl in the procession.How can I trace
her and find out who she is?"As the barge came nearer, he forced his way to the very edge of the
crowd that lined the street, without having decided what he would do,
but hoping she would see and recognize him.When the barge was almost opposite, he stepped out a little from the
line and lifted his hat.In a moment, as if she had been looking for him, she caught the crown of
flowers from her head and tossed them toward him, crying:

"For the hero!"He caught them skillfully with his right hand, his hat still in his
left.And the hot blood mounted to his face as he saw her tossing kisses
toward him with both hands.But a third cried:

"I'll tell you what it means!That young fellow is the one who saved the
Queen of Flowers from the mad steer!I know him, for I saw him do it,
and I observed his face.""That explains why she flung her crown to him and called him the hero."The crowd burst into wild cheering, and there was a general struggle to
get a fair view of Frank Merriwell, who had suddenly become the object
of attention, the splendors of the parade being forgotten for the time.Frank was confused and bewildered, and he sought to get away as quickly
as possible, hoping to follow the Queen of Flowers.But he found his way
blocked on every hand, and a hundred voices seemed to be asking:

"What's your name?""Won't you please tell us your name?""Haven't I seen you in New York?"Somewhat dazed though he was, Frank noted that, beyond a doubt, the ones
who were so very curious and who so rudely demanded his name were
visitors in New Orleans.More than that, from their appearance, they
were people who would not think of such acts at home, but now were eager
to know the Northern lad who by one nervy and daring act had made
himself generally talked about in a Southern city.Some of the women declared he was "So handsome!""I'd give a hundred dollars to get out of this!"He must have spoken the words aloud, although he was not aware of it,
for a voice at his elbow, low and musical, said:

"Come dis-a-way, senor, an' I will tek yo' out of it."The Spaniard--for such Mazaro
was--bowed gracefully, and smiled pleasantly upon the boy from the
North.A moment Frank hesitated, and then he said:

"Lead on; I'll follow."Quickly Mazaro skirted the edge of the throng for a short distance,
plunged into the mass, made sure Frank was close behind, and then
forced his way through to a doorway."Through a passage to annodare street, senor."Frank felt his revolver in his pocket, and he knew it was loaded for
instant use."I want to get ahead of this procession--I want to see the Queen of
Flowers again.""I will tek yo' there, senor."Frank passed his hand through the crown of flowers, to which he still
clung.Without being seen, he took his revolver from his pocket, and
held it concealed in the mass of flowers.It was a self-cocker, and he
could use it skillfully.As Mazaro had said, the doorway led into a passage.This was very
narrow, and quite dark.No sooner were they fairly in this place than Frank regretted that he
had come, for he realized that it was a most excellent chance for
assassination and robbery.He was quite ready for any
that might rise in front."Dis-a way, senor," Mazaro kept repeating.Frank fancied the fellow was speaking louder than was necessary.In
fact, he could not see that it was necessary for Mazaro to speak at all.And then the boy was sure he heard footsteps behind them!He was caught between two fires--he was trapped!Frank's first impulse was to leap forward, knock Mazaro down, and take
to his heels, keeping straight on through the passage.He knew not where the passage led, and he knew not what pitfalls it
might contain.At that moment Frank felt a thrill of actual fear, nervy though he was;
but he understood that he must not let fear get the best of him, and he
instantly flung it off.His ears were open, his eyes were open, and every sense was on the
alert."I will give them a warm
reception!"Then he noticed that they passed a narrow opening, like a broken door,
and, the next moment he seemed to feel cat-like footfalls at his very
heels.In a twinkling Frank whirled about, crying:

"Hold up where you are!I am armed, and I'll shoot if crowded!"He had made no mistake, for his eyes had grown accustomed to the
darkness of the passage, and he could see three dark figures blocking
his retreat along the passage.For one brief second his eyes turned the other way, and it seemed that
Manuel Mazaro had been joined by two or three others, for he saw several
forms in that direction.This sudden action of the trapped boy had filled these fellows with
surprise and dismay, and curses of anger broke from their lips, the
words being hissed rather than spoken.Frank knew he must attract attention in some way, and so of a sudden he
fired a shot into the air.The flash of his revolver showed him several dark, villainous faces."I'll not waste another
bullet!""Thot's th' talk, me laddybuck!""Give th'
spalpanes cold lead, an' plinty av it, Frankie!Frank almost screamed, in joyous amazement."Thot's me name, an' this is me marruck!"cried the Irish lad, from the
darkness.There was a hurrying rush of feet, and then--smack!smack!--two dark
figures were seen flying through the darkness as if they had been struck
by battering-rams.cheered Frank, thrusting the revolver into his pocket, and
hastening to leap into the battle."Th' United Shtates an' Ould Oireland
foriver!Nothing can shtand against th' combination!"This unexpected assault was too much for Manuel Mazaro and his
satellites."Car-r-r-ramba!"We will
have to try de odare one, pardnares.""We're reddy fer yer thricks, ye shnakes!""To th' muzzle wid grape-shot an' canister!"But the boys were not compelled to resort to deadly weapons, for the
Spaniard and his gang suddenly took to their heels, and seemed to melt
away in the darkness."Where hiv they gone, Oi dunno?""An' lift us widout sayin' good-avenin'?""Th' impoloight rascals!They should be ashamed av thimsilves!""At school you had a way of always showing up just when you were needed
most, and you have not gotten over it.""It's harrud to tache an ould dog new thricks, Frankie.""You don't want to learn any new tricks; the old ones you know are all
right."Frankie, here it is, an' I'm wid yez, me b'y, till Oi have ter lave
yez, which won't be in a hurry, av Oi know mesilf."The two lads clasped hands in the darkness of the passage."Now," said Frank, "to get out of this place.""Better go th' way we came in."But how in the world did you happen to appear at such an
opportune moment?"Oi saw yez, me b'y, whin th' crowd was cheerin' fer yez, but Oi
couldn't get to yez, though Oi troied me bist.""Oi did, but it's lost yez Oi would, av ye wasn't sane to come in here
by thim as wur watchin' av yez.""Thot it wur, me darlint, unliss ye wanter to shoot th' spalpanes ye wur
wid.Av they'd crowded yez, Oi reckon ye'd found a way to dispose av th'
lot.""They were about to crowd me when I fired into the air.""An' th' flash av th' revolver showed me yer face.""That's how you were sure it was me, is it?"Fer another, Oi hearrud yer voice, an' ye don't
suppose Oi wouldn't know thot av Oi should hear it astraddle av th'
North Pole, do yez?""Well, I am sure I knew your voice the moment I heard it, and the sound
gave no small amount of satisfaction."The boys now hurried back along the narrow passage, and soon reached the
doorway by which they had entered.The procession had passed on, and the great crowd of people had melted
from the street.As soon as they were outside the passage, Barney explained that he had
arrived in town that night, and had hurried to the St.Charles Hotel,
but had found Professor Scotch in bed, and Frank gone."Th' profissor was near scared to death av me," said Barney."He
wouldn't let me in th' room till th' bellboy had described me two or
thray toimes over, an' whin Oi did come in, he had his head under th'
clothes, an', be me soul!I thought by th' sound that he wur shakin'
dice.It wuz the tathe av him chattering togither."Frank was convulsed with laughter, while Barney went on:

"'Profissor,' sez Oi, 'av it's doice ye're shakin', Oi'll take a hand at
tin cints a corner.'""He looked out at me over the edge av th' bed-sprid, an' he sez, sez he,
'Are ye sure ye're yersilf, Barney Mulloy?or are ye Colonel Sally de la
Vilager'--or something av th' sort--'in disguise?'""Oi looked at him, an' thot wur all Oi said.Oi didn't know what th' mon
mint, an' he samed to be too broke up to tell.Oi asked him where yo
wur, an' he said ye'd gone out to see th' parade.Whin Oi found out thot
wur all Oi could get out av him, Oi came out an' looked fer yez."When Frank had ceased to laugh, he explained the meaning of the
professor's strange actions, and it was Barney's turn to laugh."So it's a duel he is afraid av, is it?""Begobs, it's niver a duel was Oi in, but the profissor wuz koind to me
at Fardale, an' it's a debt av gratitude Oi owe him, so Oi'll make me
bluff.""I do not believe Colonel Vallier will meet any one but Professor
Scotch, but the professor will be too ill to meet him, so he will have
to accept a substitute, or go without a fight.""To tell ye th' truth, Frankie, Oi'd rather he'd refuse to accept, but
it's an iligant bluff Oi can make.""Tell me what brought this duel aboit."So Frank told the whole story about the rescue of the Flower Queen, the
appearance of Rolf Raymond and Colonel Vallier, and how the masked girl
had called his name just as they were taking her away, with the result
already known to the reader."An' thot wur her Oi saw in th' parade to-noight?"I still have it here, although it
is somewhat crushed.""Ah, Frankie, me b'y, it's a shly dog ye are!Th' girruls wur foriver
getting shtuck on yez, an' Oi dunno what ye hiv been doin' since l'avin'
Fardale.It's wan av yer mashes this must be.""I've made no mashes, Barney.""Not m'anin' to, perhaps, but ye can't hilp it, laddybuck, fer they will
get shtuck on yez, av ye want thim to or not.Ye don't hiv ter troy to
catch a girrul, Frankie.""But I give you my word that I cannot imagine who this can be.All the
curiosity in my nature is aroused, and I am determined to know her name
before I rest.""Well, b'y, Oi'm wid yez."Go to the place where the Krewe of Proteus holds its ball."As both were strangers in New Orleans, they did not know how to make the
shortest cut to the ballroom, and Frank found it impossible to obtain a
carriage.They were delayed most exasperatingly, and, when they arrived
at the place where the ball was to be held, the procession had broken
up, and the Queen of Flowers was within the ballroom."I meant to get here
ahead of the procession, so that I could speak to her before she got
inside.""Well, let's go in an' spake to her now.""An' we're very ixclusive paple.""Only those having invitations can enter the ballroom."Thin it's outsoide we're lift."Is it too late to git invoitations?""They can't be bought, like tickets.""Well, what koind av a shindig do ye call this, Oi dunno?"Frank explained that Professor Scotch had been able to procure
invitations, but neither of them had fancied they would care to attend
the ball, so the opportunity had been neglected."Whinever Oi can get something fer nothing, Oi take it," said Barney."It's a use Oi can make fer most things Oi get."Frank hoped the Flower Queen
would come out, and he would be able to speak to her before she entered
a carriage and was carried away.Sweet strains of music floated down to the ears of the restless lads,
and, with each passing moment, Frank grew more and more disgusted with
himself."To think that I might be in there--might be waltzing with the Queen of
Flowers at this moment, if I had asked the professor to obtain the
invitations!"said Barney; "but ye'll know betther next toime."In some way, I must meet this girl and
speak to her."That's th' shtuff, me b'y!Whiniver ye say anything loike thot, ye
always git there wid both fate.Two men in dress suits came out to smoke and get a breath of air.They
stood conversing within a short distance of the boys."She has been the sensation of the day," said one."The whole city is
wondering who she is.""Yes, for she has vanished from the ballroom in a most unaccountable
manner.The fellow knows her, but he
positively refuses to disclose her identity."Frank's hand had fallen on Barney's arm with a grip of iron, and the
fingers were sinking deeper and deeper into the Irish lad's flesh as
these words fell on their ears."It is said that the young fellow who saved her from the steer to-day
does not know her."She saw him in the crowd to-night, and flung him her crown, calling
him a hero.He was nearly mobbed by the crowd, that was determined to
know his name, but he escaped in some way, and has not been seen since.""They are speaking of
the Flower Queen.""Sure," returned the Irish lad; "an' av yersilf, Frankie, b'y.""She is no longer in the ballroom."Barely were they in their apartments at the hotel when there came a
knock on the door, and a boy entered, bearing a salver on which were two
cards."Colonel La Salle Vallier and Mr.Frank hustled the boy out of the room, whispering:

"Bring them up, and admit them without knocking."He slipped a quarter into the boy's hand, and the little fellow grinned
and hurried away.Frank turned back to find Professor Scotch, in his night robe, standing
square in the middle of the bed, wildly waving his arms, and roaring:

"Lock the door--barricade it--keep them out!If those desperadoes are
admitted here, this room will run red with gore!""That's right, professor," agreed Frank."We'll settle their hash right
here and at once.shouted the little professor, in his big, hoarse voice."This
is murder--assassination!I am in no condition to
receive visitors.""Be calm, professor," chirped Frank, soothingly."Be calm, profissor," echoed Barney, serenely."How can I be calm on the
eve of murder and assassination?I am an unarmed man, and I am not even
dressed!""Niver moind a little thing loike thot," purred the Irish lad."It's of no consequence," declared Frank, placidly.He rushed into the front room, and flung up a window, from which he
howled:

"Fire!He would have shrieked murder and several other things, but Frank and
Barney dragged him back and closed the window."It'll be a wonder if the whole police
force of the city does not come rushing up here.""Perhaps they'll not be able to locate th' spot from which th' croy
came," said Barney.The professor squirmed out of the grasp of the two boys, and made a wild
dash for the door.Just before he reached it, the door was flung open, and Colonel Vallier,
followed by Rolf Raymond, strode into the room.The colonel and the professor met just within the doorway.The collision was violent, and both men recoiled and sat down heavily
upon the floor, while Rolf Raymond barely saved himself from falling
astride the colonel's neck.Sitting thus, the two men glared at each other, the colonel being in a
dress suit, while the professor wore a night robe.Professor Scotch became so angry at what he considered the unwarranted
intrusion of the visitors that he forgot how he was dressed, forgot to
be scared, and grew fierce as a raging lion.Without rising, he leaned
forward, and shook his fist under Colonel Vallier's nose, literally
roaring:

"What do you mean by entering this room without knocking, you miserable
old blowhard?You ought to have your face thumped, and, by thunder!gasped the colonel, in the greatest amazement and dismay."Don't'sah' me, you measly old fraud!"howled Scotch, waving his fists
in the air."I don't believe in fighting, but this is about my time to
scrap.If you don't apologize for the intrusion, may I be blown to ten
thousand fragments if I don't give you a pair of beautiful black eyes!""Sah, there seems to be some mistake, sah," fluttered Colonel Vallier,
turning pale.thundered Scotch, leaping to his feet like a
jumping jack."Get up here, and let me knock you down!""I decline to be struck, sah."howled the excited little man, growing still
worse, as the colonel seemed to shrink and falter."Why, I can lick you
in a fraction of no time!You've been making lots of fighting talk, and
now it's my turn."I
am no prize-fightah, gentlemen.""That isn't my lookout," said the professor, who was forcing things
while they ran his way."Yes, with pistols, if you want to!"cried the professor, to the
amazement of the boys.We will settle it with pistols,
at once, in this room.""But this is no place foh a duel, sah; yo' should know that, sah.""The one who survives will be arrested, sah.""There won't be a survivor, so you needn't fear arrest."You are such a blamed coward that you won't
fight me with your fists, for fear I will give you the thumping you
deserve; but you know you are a good pistol shot, and you think I am
not, so you hope to shoot me, and escape without harm to yourself.Well,
I am no pistol shot, but I am not going to miss you.We'll shoot across
that center table, and the width of the table is the distance that will
divide us.In that way, I'll stand as good a show as you do, and I'll
agree to shoot you through the body very near to the heart, so you'll
not linger long in agony.he fluttered; "you're shorely crazy!""But I--I never heard of such a duel--never!""There are many things you have never heard about, Colonel Vallier.""But, sah, I can't fight that way!You'll have to excuse me, sah."howled the little professor, dancing about in his night
robe.Why, I can't----"

"Then I'm going to give you those black eyes just as sure as my name is
Scotch!The colonel retreated, holding up his hands helplessly, while the
professor pranced after him like a fighting cock.snapped Rolf Raymond, taking a step, as if to
interfere."Don't chip in where you're not
wanted, Mr."Thot's roight, me laddybuck," said Barney Mulloy."If you bother thim,
it's a pair av black oies ye may own yersilf.""We did not come here to be bullied.""No," said Frank; "you came to play the bullies, and the tables have
been turned on you.The two boys placed themselves in such a position that they could
prevent Raymond from interfering between the colonel and the professor.gasped Vallier, holding up his open hands, with
the palms toward the bantam-like professor."You will strike me if I do not apologize?""You may bet your life that I will, colonel.""Then I--ah--I'll have to apologize, sah.""And this settles the entire affair between us?""Eh--I don't know about that.""And you state of your own free will that this settles all trouble
between us?"The colonel hesitated, and Scotch lifted his fists menacingly."I do, sah--I do!""Then that's right," said Professor Scotch, airily."You have escaped
the worst thumping you ever received in all your life, and you should
congratulate yourself."Surely Professor Scotch had done
himself proud, and the termination of the affair had been quite
unexpected by the boys.THE PROFESSOR'S COURAGE.Colonel Vallier seemed utterly crestfallen and subdued, but Rolf
Raymond's face was dark with anger, as he harshly said:

"Now that this foolishness is over, we will proceed to business.""The quicker you proceed the better
satisfied we will be.Rolf turned fiercely on Frank, almost snarling:

"You must have been at the bottom of it all!Frank was astonished, as his face plainly showed."It is useless to pretend that you do not know.You must have found an
opportunity to communicate with her somehow, although how you
accomplished it is more than I understand."If you do not immediately tell us where she is, you will find
yourself in serious trouble."You know I mean the Queen of Flowers.""And you do not know what has become of her?"No one saw
her leave, but she went.""That will not go with us, Merriwell, for we hastened to the place where
she is stopping with her father, and she was not there, nor had he seen
her.He cannot live long, and this blow will hasten the end.Take my advice and give her up at once, unless you wish to
get into trouble of a most serious nature."Frank saw that Raymond actually believed he knew what had become of the
Flower Queen."Look here," came swiftly from the boy's lips, "it is plain this is no
time to waste words.I do not know what has become of the Flower Queen,
that is straight.I did know she had disappeared from the ballroom, but
I supposed she had returned to her home.I do not know her name as yet,
although she knows mine.If anything has happened to her, I am not
responsible; but I take a great interest in her, and I am ready and
eager to be of assistance to her.Tell me her name, as that will aid
me."Rolf Raymond could not doubt Frank's words, for honesty was written on
the boy's face."Her name," he said--"her name is--for you to learn."His taunting laugh brought the warm blood to Frank's face."I'll learn it, no thanks to
you.More than that, if she needs my aid, she shall have it.It strikes
me that she may have fled of her own accord to escape being persecuted
by you.If so----"

"What then?"Colonel Vallier may have settled his trouble with
Professor Scotch, but mine is not settled with you.""We may yet meet on the field of honor.""I shall be pleased to accommodate you," flashed Frank; "and the sooner,
the better it will satisfy me."cried Barney Mulloy, admiringly."You can do th'
spalpane, Frankie, at any old thing he'll name!""The disappearance of Miss ----, the Flower Queen, prevents the setting
of a time and place," said Raymond, passionately; "but you shall be
waited on as soon as she is found.Until then I must let nothing
interfere with my search for her.""Very good; that is satisfactory to me, and I will do my best to help
find her for you.Now, if your business is quite over, gentlemen, your
room would give us much more pleasure than your company."Not another word did Raymond or Vallier say, but they strode stiffly to
the door and bowed themselves out.Then both the boys turned on Professor Scotch, to find he had collapsed
into a chair, and seemed on the point of swooning."Professor," cried Frank, "I want to congratulate you!That was the best
piece of work you ever did in all your life.""Profissor," exclaimed Barney, "ye're a jewil!Av inny wan iver says you
lack nerve, may Oi be bitten by th' wurrust shnake in Oireland av Oi
don't break his head!"gasped the professor, "fan me!"You were a man, professor, and you showed Colonel Vallier that you were
utterly reckless."Colonel Vallier didn't know that.It was plain, he believed you a
desperate slugger, and he wilted immediately.""But I can't understand how I came to do such a thing.Till their
unwarranted intrusion--till I collided with the colonel--I was in terror
for my life.The moment we collided I seemed to forget that I was
scared, and I remembered only that I was mad.""And you seemed more than eager for a scrap.""Ye samed doying fer a bit av a row, profissor."If he'd struck you, you'd been so mad that nothing could have
stopped you.You would have waded into him, and given him the worst
thrashing he ever received.""Thot's pwhat ye would, profissor, sure as fate."Scotch began to revive, and the words of the boys convinced him that he
was really a very brave man, and had done a most daring thing.Little by
little, he began to swell, like a toad."I don't know but you're right," he said, stiffening up."I was utterly
reckless and desperate at the time.""Profissor, ye're a bad mon ter buck against.""That is a fact that has not been generally known, but, having cowed one
of the most desperate duelists in the South, and forced him to
apologize, I presume I have a right to make some pretensions.""Ye've made a riccord fer yersilf.""And a record to be proud of," crowed the little man, getting on his
feet and beginning to strut, forgetful of the fact that he was in his
night robe and presented a most ludicrous appearance."The events of
this evening shall become a part of history.Future generations shall
regard me as one of the most nervy and daring men of my age.And really,
I don't know but I am.What's the use of being a coward when you can be
a hero just as well.Boys, this adventure has made a different man of
me.Hereafter, you will see that I'll not quail in the face of the most
deadly dangers.I'll even dare to walk up to the mouth of a cannon--if I
know it isn't loaded."The boys were forced to laugh at his bantam-like appearance, but, for
all of the queer twist he had given his last expression, the professor
seemed very serious, and it was plain that he had begun to regard
himself with admiration."Think, boys," he cried--"think of my offer to fight him with pistols
across yonder narrow table!""That was a stroke of genius, professor," declared Frank."That broke
Colonel Vallier up more than anything else.""Of course you did not mean to actually fight him that way?""Well, I don't know," swelled the little man."I was reckless then, and
I didn't care for anything.""This other matter they spoke of worries me," he said."I can't
understand what has happened to the Queen of Flowers.""Ye mustn't let thot worry yez, me b'y.""She may be home by this toime.""And she may be in desperate need of a helping hand.""Av she is, Oi dunno how ye can hilp her, Frankie.""It would be a most daring thing to do, as she is so well known; but
there are daring and desperate ruffians in New Orleans.""Oi think ye're roight, me b'y.""It may be that she has been persecuted so that she fled of her own
accord, and yet I hardly think that is true.""If it is not true, surely she is in trouble.""Oh, I can't remain quietly here, knowing she may need aid!""Sure, me b'y, Oi'm wid yez firrust, larrust, an' all th' toime!"He returned to bed, and the boys left
the hotel."I don't know," replied Frank, helplessly."There is not one chance in
millions of finding the lost Flower Queen, but I feel that I must move
about.We'll visit the old French quarter by night.I have been there in
the daytime, and I'd like to see how it looks at night.And so they made their way to the French quarter, crossing Canal Street
and turning into a quiet, narrow way, that soon brought them to a region
of architectural decrepitude.The streets of this section were not overlighted, and seemed very silent
and lonely, as, at this particular time, the greater part of the
inhabitants of the quarter were away to the scenes of pleasure.There were queer balconies on
every hand, the stores were mere shops, all of them now closed, and many
windows were nailed up.Rust and decay were on all sides, and yet there
was something impressive in the almost Oriental squalor of the place."It sames loike we'd left th' city intoirely for another place, so it
does," muttered Barney."New Orleans seems like a human being
with two personalities.For me this is the most interesting part of the
city; but commerce is beginning to crowd in here, and the time is coming
when the French quarter will cease to be an attraction for New Orleans.""Well, we'll get our look at it before it is gone intoirely."A few dark figures were moving silently along the streets.The night was
warm, and the shutters of the balcony windows were opened to admit air.At a corner they halted, and, of a sudden, Frank clutched the arm of his
companion, whispering:

"Look--see that man?""Well, I did, and I do not believe I am mistaken in thinking I have seen
it before.""In the alley where I was trapped by Manuel Mazaro and his gang.""It wur darruk in there, Frankie.""But I fired my revolver, and by the flash I saw a face.""It was the face of the man who just passed beneath this light.""An' pwhat av thot, Frankie?""He might lead me to Manuel Mazaro.""Pwhat do yez want to see thot spalpane fer?""Why I was attacked, and the object of the attack."It sure wur a case av intinded robbery, me b'y."He knows all about Rolf
Raymond and Colonel Vallier.""Rolf Raymond and Colonel Vallier know a great deal about the lost
Flower Queen.It is possible Mazaro knows something of her.Come on,
Barney; we'll follow that man.""Jist as ye say, me lad.""Take the other side of the street, and keep him in sight, but do not
seem to be following him."They separated, and both kept in sight of the man, who did not seem to
fear pursuit or dream any one was shadowing him.He led them straight to an antiquated story and a half Creole cottage,
shaded by a large willow tree, the branches of which touched the sides
and swept the round tiles of the roof.The foliage of the old tree half
concealed the discolored stucco, which was dropping off in many places.Over the door was a sign which announced that it was a cafe.The door
was open, and, in the first room could be seen some men who were eating
and drinking at a table.The man the boys had followed entered the cottage, passed through the
first room, speaking to the men at the table, and disappeared into the
room beyond."Are yez goin' to folly him, Frankie, b'y?""There's no tellin' pwhat koind av a nest ye will get inther.""I'll have to take my chances on that.""Thin Oi'm wid yez.""No, I want you to remain outside, so you will be on hand in case I need
air.""How'll I know ye nade it?""Av Oi do, you'll see Barney Mulloy comin' loike a cyclone.""I know I may depend on you, and I know this may be a nest of assassins.These Spaniards are hot-blooded fellows, and they make dangerous
rascals."Frank looked at his revolver, to make sure it was in perfect working
order, dropped it into the side pocket of his coat, and walked boldly
into the cottage cafe.The men in the front room stared at him in surprise, but he did not seem
to give them a glance, walking straight through into the next room.There he saw two Spanish-looking fellows talking in low tones over a
table, on which drinks were setting.One of them was the man he had followed.They were surprised to see the boy coolly walk into the room, and
advance without hesitation to their table.The one Frank had followed seemed to recognize the lad, and he appeared
startled and somewhat alarmed.With the greatest politeness, Frank touched his cap, asking:

"Senor, do you know Manuel Mazaro?"The fellow scowled, and hesitated, and then retorted:

"What if I do?"At one side of the room was a door, opening on a dark flight of stairs.Through this doorway and up the stairs the fellow disappeared.Frank sat down at the table, feeling the revolver in the side pocket of
his coat.The other man did not attempt to make any conversation.In a few minutes the one who had ascended the stairs reappeared."Senor Mazaro will soon be down," he announced.Then he sat at the table, and resumed conversation with his companion,
speaking in Spanish, and not even seeming to hear the "thank you" from
Frank.It was not long before Mazaro appeared, and he came forward without
hesitation, smiling serenely, as if delighted to see the boy.he cried, "yo' be not harm in de scrape what we run into?""I was not harmed, no, thanks to you, Mazaro," said the boy, coolly."It
is a wonder that I came out with a whole skin.""Senor, you do not blame me fo' dat?I deed not know-a it--I deed not
know-a de robbares were there.""Mazaro, you are a very good liar, but it will not work with me."The Spaniard showed his teeth, and fell back a step."De young senor speak-a ver' plain," he said.Mazaro, we may as well understand each other first as
last.You are a scoundrel, and you're out for the dollars.Now, it is
possible you can make more money by serving me than in any other way.If
you can help me, I will pay you well."Mazaro looked ready to sink a knife into Frank's heart a moment before,
but he suddenly thawed.With the utmost politeness, he said:

"I do not think-a I know what de senor mean.If he speak-a litt'l
plainer, mebbe I ondarstan'."The Spaniard took a seat at the table."Now," said Frank, quietly, "order what you wish to drink, and I will
pay for it.I never drink myself, and I never carry much money with me
nights, but I have enough to pay for your drink.""De senor is ver' kind," bowed Manuel, and he ordered a drink, which was
brought by a villainous-looking old woman.Frank paid, and, when Mazaro was sipping the liquid, he leaned forward
and said:

"Senor Mazaro, you know Rolf Raymond?""I know of her, senor; I see her to-day."She has disappeared, and you know what has become of
her."It was a chance shot, but Frank saw it went home.Mazaro changed color, and then he regained his composure."Senor," he said, smoothly, "I know-a not what made you t'ink dat.""Wondareful--ver' wondareful," purred the Spaniard, in mock admiration."You give-a me great s'prise."Frank was angry, but he held himself in restraint, appearing cool.Dat show yo' have-a ver' gre't eye, senor.""Why should I do dat when you know-a so much?"I dare ver' many thing you do not know.""Look here, man," said Frank, leaning toward the Spaniard; "are you
aware that you may get yourself into serious trouble?Are you aware that
kidnaping is an offense that makes you a criminal of the worst sort, and
for which you might be sent up for twenty years, at least?""It is eeze to talk, but dat is not proof," he said.exclaimed the boy, his anger getting the better of him
for the moment."I have a mind to convey my suspicions to the police,
and then----"

"An' den what, senor?you talk ver' bol' fo' boy like you.Well, see; if I snappa my fingare, quick like a flash you
get a knife 'tween your shouldares.He looked swiftly around, and saw the
black eyes of the other two men were fastened upon him, and he knew
they were ready to obey Mazaro's signal."W'at yo' t'ink-a, senor?""That is very well," came calmly from Frank's lips."If I were to give
the signal my friends would rush in here to my aid.If you stab me, make
sure the knife goes through my heart with the first stroke, so there
will be little chance that I'll cry out.""Den you have-a friends near, ha?Now we undarestan' each odder.Yo' have-a some more to say?""I have told you that you might find it profitable to serve me.""No dirty work--no throat-cutting.W'at yo' want-a know?""I want to know who the Queen of Flowers is.""Yes; I want to know where she is, and you can tell me.""Yo' say dat, but yo' can't prove it.I don't say anyt'ing, senor.'Bo't
how much yo' pay fo' that info'mation, ha?""Fair price notting; I want good-a price.Yo' don' have-a de mon' enough.""I am a Yankee, from the North, and I will make a
trade with you.""All-a right, but I don't admit I know anyt'ing."Manuel leaned back in his chair, lazily and deftly rolling a cigarette,
which he lighted.Frank watched this piece of business, thinking of the
best manner of approaching the fellow.And then something happened that electrified every one within the cafe.Somewhere above there came the sound of blows, and a crashing,
splintering sound, as of breaking wood.Then a shriek ran through the
building.It was the voice of a female in great terror and distress.Mazaro ground a curse through his white teeth, and leaped to his feet,
but Frank was on his feet quite as quickly.Frank's arm had shot out, and his hard fist struck the Spaniard
under the ear, sending the fellow flying through the air and up against
the wall with terrible force.From the wall Mazaro dropped, limp and
groaning, to the floor.Like a flash, the nervy youth flung the table against the downcast
wretch's companions, making them reel.Then Frank leaped toward the stairs, up which he bounded like a deer.Near the head of the stairs a light shone out through a broken panel in
a door, and on this door Frank knew the blows he had heard must have
fallen.Within this room the boy fancied he could hear sounds of a desperate
struggle.Behind him the desperadoes were rallying, cursing hoarsely, and crying
to each other.They were coming, and the lad on the stairs knew they
would come armed to the teeth.All the chivalry in his nature was aroused.His blood was leaping and
tingling in his veins, and he felt able to cope with a hundred foes.Straight toward the broken door he leaped, and his hand found the knob,
but it refused to yield at his touch.He hurled himself against the door, but it remained firm.There were feet on the stairs; the desperadoes were coming.At that moment he looked into the room through the break in the panel,
and he saw a girl struggling with all her strength in the hands of a
man.The man was trying to hold a hand over her mouth to keep her from
crying out again, while a torrent of angry Spanish words poured in a
hissing sound from his bearded lips.As Frank looked the girl tore the fellow's hand from her lips, and her
cry for help again rang out.The wretch lifted his fist to strike her senseless, but the blow did not
fall.Frank was a remarkably good shot, and his revolver was in his hand.That
hand was flung upward to the opening in the panel, and he fired into the
room.The burst of smoke kept him from seeing the result of the shot, but he
heard a hoarse roar of pain from the man, and he knew he had not missed.He had fired at the fellow's wrist, and the bullet had shattered it.But now the ruffians who were coming furiously up the stairs demanded
his attention."Stop where you are, or I shall open fire on you!"He could see them, and he saw the foremost lift his hand.Then there was
a burst of flame before Frank's eyes, and he staggered backward, feeling
a bullet near his cheek.Not till that moment did he realize what a trap he was in, and how
desperate was his situation.The smell of burned powder was in his nostrils, the fire of battle
gleamed from his eyes.The weapon in Frank's hand spoke again, and once more he found his game,
for the leading ruffian, having almost reached the head of the stairs,
flung up his arms, with a gurgling sound, and toppled backward upon
those who were following.Down the stairs they all tumbled, falling in a heap at the bottom, where
they struggled, squirmed, and shouted."This
has turned out to be a real lively night."Frank was a lad who never deliberately sought danger for danger's sake,
but when his blood was aroused, he entirely forgot to be afraid, and he
felt a wild thrill of joy when in the greatest peril.For the time, he had entirely forgotten the existence of Barney Mulloy,
but now he remembered that the Irish lad had waited outside the cottage
cafe."He has heard the rumpus," said Frank, aloud."Whist, be aisy, me lad!"retorted the familiar voice of the Irish
youth."Oi'm wid yez to th' ind!""How in the world did you get here?"cried our hero, in great
astonishment."Oi climbed the tray, me b'y.""Th' willey tray as shtands forninst th' corner av th' house, Frankie.""But that does not explain how you came here at my side.""There was a windy open, an' Oi shlipped in by th' windy.""Well, you're a dandy, Barney!""An' ye're a birrud, Frankie.What koind av a muss hiv ye dhropped into
now, Oi'd loike ter know?"I heard a girl shout for help, and I knocked over
two or three chaps, Mazaro included, on my way to her aid.""Where is she now, b'y?""In here," said Frank, pointing through the broken panel."She is the
missing Queen of Flowers!Then Frank obtained a fair look at the girl's face, staggered, clutched
Barney, and shouted:

"Look!It is not strange she knew me, for we both know her!While attending school at Fardale Military Academy, Frank had met and
become acquainted with a charming girl by the name of Inza Burrage.They
had been very friendly--more than friendly; in a boy and girl way, they
were lovers.After leaving Fardale and starting to travel, Frank had written to Inza,
and she had answered.For a time the correspondence had continued, but,
at last, Frank had failed to receive any answers to his letters.He
wrote again and again, but never a line came from Inza, and he finally
decided she had grown tired of him, and had taken this method of
dropping him.Frank was proud and sensitive, and he resolved to forget Inza.This was
not easy, but he thought of her as little as possible, and never spoke
of her to any one.And now he had met her in this remarkable manner.Some fellow had
written him from Fardale that Mr.Burrage had moved from the place, but
no one seemed to know whither he had gone.Frank had not dreamed of
seeing Inza in New Orleans, but she was the mysterious Queen of Flowers,
and, for some reason, she was in trouble and peril.Although dazed by his astonishing discovery, the boy quickly recovered,
and he felt that he could battle with a hundred ruffians in the defense
of the girl beyond the broken door.Barney Mulloy seemed no less astonished than Frank.At that moment, however, the ruffian whose wrist Frank had broken,
leaped upon the girl and grasped her with his uninjured arm."_Carramba!_" he snarled.You never git-a
out with whole skin!"cried Frank, pointing his revolver at the
fellow--"drop her, or I'll put a bullet through your head, instead of
your wrist!"He held the struggling girl before him as a shield.Like a raging lion, Frank tore at the panel.The man with the girl swiftly moved back to a door at the farther side
of the room.This door he had already unfastened and flung open."_Adios!_" he cried, derisively."Some time I square wid you for my
hand-a!_Adios!_"

"Th' spalpanes are comin' up th' shtairs again, Frankie!"cried Barney,
in the ear of the desperate boy at the door.Frank did not seem to hear; he was striving to break the stout panel so
that he could force his way through the opening.they're coming up th' shtairs!""They'll make mince mate av us!""Well, folly, av ye want to!""Oi'm goin' to
shtop th' gang!"Out came a long strip,
which Frank flung upon the floor.Barney caught it up and whirled toward the stairs.The desperadoes were coming with a rush--they were well up the stairs.In another moment the leading ruffian would have reached the second
floor."Get back, ye gossoons!The strip of heavy wood in Barney's hands whirled through the air, and
came down with a resounding crack on the head of the leader.The fellows had not learned caution by the fate of the first man to
climb the stairs, and they were following their second leader as close
as possible.Barney had a strong arm, and he struck the fellow with all his power.Well it was for the ruffian that the heavy wood was not very thick, else
he would have had a broken head.Back he toppled upon the one behind, and that one made a vain attempt to
support him.The dead weight was too much, and the second fell, again
sweeping the whole lot to the foot of the stairs.shouted the Irish boy, in wild delight."This is th' koind av a
picnic pwhat Oi admire!It's Barney Mulloy ye're
runnin' up against, an' begobs!he's good fer th' whole crowd av yez!"At the foot of the stairs there was a writhing, wrangling, snarling mass
of human beings; at the head of the stairs was a young Irishman who
laughed and crowed and flourished the cudgel of wood in his hands.Barney, feeling his blood leaping joyously in his veins, felt like
singing, and so he began to warble a "fighting song," over and over
inviting his enemies to come on.In the meantime Frank had made an opening large enough to force his body
through.he cried, attracting the other boy's attention by a
sharp blow."Frankie, ye're muddled, an' Oi nivver saw yez so before.""Nivver a bit would it do for us both to go in there, fer th' craythers
moight hiv us in a thrap."You stay here and hold the ruffians
back.Oi hiv an illigant shillaly
here, an' thot's all Oi nade, unliss ye have two revolvers.""Thin kape it, me b'y, fer ye'll nade it before ye save the lass, Oi
think.""I think you may be right, Barney."It's nivver a bit Oi worry about thot, Frankie.As soon as he was within the
room he ran for the door through which the ruffian had dragged Inza.Frank knew that the fellow might be waiting just beyond the door, knife
in hand, and he sprang through with his revolver held ready for instant
use.There was no light in the room, but the light from the lamp in the
adjoining room shone in at the doorway.Frank looked around, and, to his dismay, he could see no one.It was not long before he was convinced that the room was empty of any
living being save himself.The Spanish ruffian and the unfortunate girl had disappeared."Oh, confound the infernal luck!"But I did my best, and I followed as soon as possible."Then he remembered that he had promised Inza he would save her, and it
wrung a groan from his lips.he cried, beginning to look for a door that
led from the room.By this time he was accustomed to the dim light, and he saw a door.In a
twinkling he had tried it, but found it was locked or bolted on the
farther side."The fellow had little time and no hands to lock a door.He must, for this is the only door to the room, save the
one by which I entered.He went out this way, and I will follow!"Retreating to the farther side of the room, Frank made a run and plunged
against the door.It was bolted on the farther side, and the shock snapped the iron bolt
as if it had been a pipe stem.Open flew the door, and Frank went reeling through, revolver in
hand, somewhat dazed, but still determined and fierce as a young tiger.At a glance he saw he was in a small room, with two doors standing
open--the one he had just broken down and another.Through this other he
leaped, and found himself in a long passage, at the farther end of which
Barney Mulloy was still guarding the head of the stairs, once more
singing the wild "fighting song."Not a trace of the ruffian or the kidnaped girl could Frank see.he palpitated, mystified and awe-stricken.That was a question he could not answer for a moment, and then----

"The window in that room!It must
be the one by which the wretch fled with Inza!"Back into the room he had just left he leaped.Two bounds carried him to
the window, against which brushed the branch of the old willow tree.The exultant words came in a panting whisper from his lips as he saw
some dark figures on the ground beneath the tree.He was sure he saw a
female form among them, and his ears did not deceive him, for he heard
at last a smothered appeal for help.Then two other forms rushed out of the shadows and fell upon the men
beneath the tree, striking right and left!There was a short, fierce struggle, a woman's shriek, the death groan of
a stricken man, a pistol shot, and scattering forms.Without pausing to measure the distance to the ground, Frank sprang over
the window sill and dropped.Like a cat, Frank alighted on his feet, and he was ready for anything
the moment he struck the ground.There was no longer any fighting beneath the tree.The struggling mass
had melted to two dark figures, one of which was stretched on the
ground, while the other bent over it.Frank sprang forward and caught the kneeling one by the shoulder.Then the boy recovered, again demanding:

"What has become of Miss Burrage?The colonel looked around in a dazed way, slowly saying:

"Yes, sah, she was here, fo' Mistah Raymon' heard her voice, and he
rushed in to save her."The colonel motioned toward the silent form on the ground, and Frank
bent forward to peer into the white, ghastly face."He was stabbed at the ver' start, sah."We were searching fo' Manuel Mazaro, sah.Mistah Raymon' did not trus'
the rascal, and he believed Mazaro might know something about Miss
Burrage.Mazaro is ready fo' anything, and he knew big money would be
offered fo' the recovery of the young lady, so he must have kidnaped
her.We knew where to find Mazaro, though he did not suppose so, and we
came here.As we approached, we saw some figures beneath this tree.Then
we heard a feminine cry fo' help, and we rushed in here, sah.That's
all, except that Mistah Raymon' rushed to his death, and the rascals
have escaped.""They have escaped with the girl--carried her away!""But they will not dare keep her now, sah.""Because they are known, and the entire police of the city will be after
them.""I don't know, but I do not think they will harm her, sah.""His affianced bride, sah.""Well, she will not marry him now," said Frank; "but I am truly sorry
that the fellow was killed in such a dastardly manner.""So am I, sah," confessed the queer colonel."He has been ver' valuable
to me.It will be a long time before I find another like him."Frank did not understand that remark then, but he did afterward, when he
was told that Colonel Vallier was a professional card sharp, and had
bled Rolf Raymond for many thousands of dollars.This explained the
singular friendship between the sharp old rascal and the young man.More than that, Frank afterward learned that Colonel Vallier was not a
commissioned officer, had never been such, but had assumed the title.In many ways the man tried to imitate the Southern gentleman of the old
school, but, as he was not a gentleman at heart, he was a sad failure.All at once Frank remembered Barney, and that he had promised to stand
by the Irish lad."Barney Mulloy is in there with that gang of
raging wolves!""Nivver a bit av it, Frankie," chirped a cheerful voice.Down from the tree swung the fighting Irish lad, dropping beside his
comrade."Th' craythers didn't feel loike comin' up th' shtairs inny more,"
Barney explained."They seemed to hiv enough sport fer wan avenin'.Somebody shouted somethin' to thim, an' away they wint out doors, so I
took to lookin' fer yez, me b'y.""Oi looked out av th' windy, an' hearrud yer voice.Thot's whoy Oi came
down.Phat has happened out here, Oi dunno?""Well, it's the avil wan's oun luck!""But av we shtay
here, Frankie, it's pinched we'll be by the police as will be afther
getting around boy and boy."Inza----"

"She ain't here inny more, me lad, an' so ye moight as well go."Swiftly and silently they slipped away, leaving Colonel Vallier with the
dead youth.Frank was feeling disgusted and desperate, and he expressed himself
freely as they made their way along the streets."It is voile luck," admitted Barney; "but we did our bist, an' it's a
jolly good foight we had.Frankie, we make a whole tame, wid a litthle
yaller dog under th' waggin.""Oh, I can't think of anything but Inza, Inza, Inza!Out of a dark shadow timidly came a female figure.With a cry of joy, Frank sprang forward, and clasped her in his arms,
lifting her off her feet and covering her face, eyes and mouth with
kisses, while he cried:

"Inza, girl!We fought like fiends to save you, and we
thought we had failed.But now----"

"You did your best, Frank, but that dreadful wretch dragged me to the
window and dropped me into the arms of a monster who was waiting below.I made up my mind that I would keep my
senses and try to escape.The man jumped after me, and then a signal was
given that brought the others from the building.They were going to wrap
something about my head when I got my mouth free and cried out.There was fighting, and I caught a
glimpse of the face of Rolf Raymond.I
felt myself free, and I ran, ran, ran, till I fell here from exhaustion,
and here I lay till I heard your voice.cried Barney, "it's a bit ago we were ravin' at our
luck: It's givin' thanks we should be this minute."Inza is safe, Rolf Raymond
is dead, and----"

A cry broke from the lips of the girl."But you were affianced to him?"My father and Roderick Raymond, who is a <DW36> and
has not many more years to live, were schoolmates and friends in their
younger days.Roderick Raymond has made a vast fortune, and in his old
age he set his heart upon having his son marry the daughter of his
former friend and partner.It seems that, when they first got married,
father and Raymond declared, in case the child of one was a boy, and
that of the other was a girl, that their children should marry.Raymond's only son, as I am an only daughter.Believing himself
ready to die, Roderick Raymond sent to my father and reminded him of
their agreement.As you know, father is not very wealthy, and he is now
an invalid.His mind is not strong, and he became convinced that it was
his duty to see that I married Rolf Raymond.He set his mind on it, and
all my pleadings were in vain.He brought me here to the South, and I
saw Rolf.I disliked him violently the moment my eyes rested on him,
but he seemed to fall madly in love with me.He was fiercely jealous of
me, and watched me as a dog watches its mistress.I could not escape
him, and I was becoming entangled deeper and deeper when you appeared.I
knew you, and I was determined to see you again--to ask you to save me.I took part in the parade to-night, and went to the ballroom.Rolf
followed me about so that I became disgusted and slipped from the room,
intending to return home alone.Barely had I left the room when a fellow
whispered in my ear that he had been sent there by you--that I was to go
with him, and he would take me to you.I entered a closed carriage, and
I was brought to the place where you found me a captive in the hands of
those ruffians."Frank had listened with eager interest to this explanation, and it made
everything clear."It was ordained by fate that we should find you there," he declared."It was known the Queen of Flowers had disappeared, and we were
searching for you.Rolf Raymond
came there, also, and he came to his death.But, Inza, explain one
thing--why didn't you answer my letters?""I did not; but I received no answers.""Then," cried the girl, "your letters must have been intercepted.I did not know your address, so I could
not ask for an explanation.""Well, it has come out right at last.We'll find a carriage and take you
home.They reached Canal Street, and found a carriage.Inza's invalid father was astounded when he saw Frank and Barney Mulloy
appear with his daughter, and he was more than ever astounded and
agitated when he knew what had happened.But Inza was safe, and Rolf Raymond was dead.It was a lively tale the boys related to Professor Scotch that night.The little man fairly gasped for breath as he listened.In the morning the police had taken hold of the affair, and they were
hot after the fellows who had killed Rolf Raymond.Frank and Barney were
called on to tell their story, and were placed under surveillance.But the cottage cafe was deserted, and the Spanish rascals were not
captured.They disappeared from New Orleans, and, to this day, the law
has never avenged the death of Roderick Raymond's only son.The murder of his boy was too much for Raymond to endure, and he died of
a broken heart on the day of the son's funeral.Knowing he was dying, he
had a new will swiftly made, and all his wealth was left to his old
friend Burrage.Frank and Barney thoroughly enjoyed the rest of their stay in New
Orleans.In the open carriage with them, at Frank's side, rode the
"Queen of Flowers" as they went sight-seeing.In the throng of spectators, with two detectives near at hand, they saw
Colonel La Salle Vallier.He lifted his hat and bowed with the utmost
courtesy."The auld chap is something of a daisy, after all, Frankie," laughed
Barney."Oi kinder admire th' spalpane."coughed Professor Scotch, at Barney's side."He is a great
duelist--a great duelist, but he quailed before my terrible eye--he was
forced to apologize."If anything happens when we are again separated that you should fail to
receive my letters, you will not doubt me, will you?"he asked, in a
whisper.And she softly replied:

"No, Frank, but----"

"But what?""You--you must not forget Elsie Bellwood.""I haven't heard from her in a long time," said Frank.But Frank was to hear from his other girl friend soon and in a most
unexpected manner.From New Orleans Frank, Barney and the professor journeyed to Florida.Frank was anxious to see the Everglades and do some hunting.Our hero was particularly anxious to shoot a golden heron, of which he
had heard not a little.One day a start was made in a canoe from a small settlement on the edge
of the great Dismal Swamp, and on went our three friends deeper and
deeper into the wilds.At last the professor grew tired of the sameness of the journey."How much further into this wild swamp do you intend to go, Frank?""I am going till I get a shot at a golden heron."White hunters have searched the
remote fastnesses of the Florida swamps for a golden heron, but no such
bird have they ever found.The Indians are the only ones to see golden
herons.""If the Indians can see them, white men may find them.I shall not be
satisfied till I have shot one.""Oh, I don't know about that, professor.I am something of an Indian
myself.You know the Seminoles are honest and peaceable, and----"

"All Indians are liars.I would not take the word of a Seminole under
any condition.Come, Frank, don't be foolish; let's turn round and go
back.We may get bewildered on these winding waterways which twist here
and there through swamps of cypress and rushes.We were foolish to come
without a guide, but----"

"We could not obtain one until to-morrow, and I wished to come to-day.""You may be sorry you did not wait.""Now, you are getting scared, professor," laughed Frank, lifting his
paddle from the water and laying it across the bow of the canoe."I'll
tell you what we'll do.""We'll leave it to Barney, who has not had a word to say on the matter.If he says go back, we'll go back."Professor Scotch hesitated, scratched his fingers into his fiery beard,
and then said:

"Well, I'll have to do as you boys say, anyway, so we'll leave it to
Barney.""All right," laughed Frank, once more."What do you say, Barney, my
boy?"Barney Mulloy was in the stern of the canoe that had been creeping along
one of the sluggish water courses that led through the cypress swamp and
into the heart of the Everglades."Well, gintlemin," he said, "Oi've been so busy thrying to kape thrack
av th' twists an' turruns we have been makin' thot Oi didn't moind mutch
pwhat ye wur soaying.So the matter was laid before him, and, when he had heard what Frank and
the professor had to say, he declared:

"Fer mesilf it's nivver a bit do Oi care where we go ur pwhat we do,
but, as long as we hiv come so fur, an' Frankie wants to go furder, Oi'd
soay go on till he is sick av it an' reddy to turn back.""As I knew it would be settled," growled Professor Scotch, sulkily."You
boys combine against me every time.Well, I suppose I'll have to
submit."So the trio pushed on still farther into the great Dismal Swamp, a weird
section of strange vegetable and animal life, where great black trees
stood silent and grim, with Spanish moss dangling from their branches,
bright-plumaged birds flashed across the opens, ugly snakes glided
sinuously over the boggy land, and sleepy alligators slid from muddy
banks and disappeared beneath the surface of the dead water."If we should come upon one of these wonderful golden herons, Frank
could not come within a hundred yards of it with that old bow and
arrow," he said."Perhaps not, but I could make a bluff at
it.""I don't see why you won't use a gun."In the first place, in order to be sure of
killing a heron with a shotgun I'd have to use fairly large shot, and
that might injure the bird badly; in the second place, there might be
two, and I'd not be able to bag more than one of them with a gun, as the
report would scare the other.Then there is the possibility that I would
miss with the first shot, and the heron would escape entirely.If I miss
with an arrow, it is not likely the bird will be alarmed and take to
flight, so I'll have another chance at it.Oh, there are some advantages
in using the primitive bow and arrow.""You have a way of always making out a good
case for yourself.he is a hard b'y to bate, profissor," grinned Barney."Av he
wurn't, it's dead he'd been long ago.""That's right, that's right," agreed Scotch, who admired Frank more than
he wished to acknowledge."It's not all luck, profissor," assured the Irish boy."In minny cases
it's pure nerve thot pulls him through.""Well, there's a great deal of luck in it--of course there is.""Oh, humor the professor, Barney," laughed Frank."Perhaps he'll become
better natured if you do."They now came to a region of wild cypress woods, where the treetops were
literally packed with old nests, made in the peculiar heron style.They
were constructed of huge bristling piles of cross-laid sticks, not
unlike brush heaps of a Western clearing.Here for years, almost ages, different species of herons had built their
nests in perfect safety.As the canoe slowly and silently glided toward the "rookeries," white
and blue herons were seen to rise from the reed-grass and fly across the
opens in a stately manner, with their long necks folded against their
breasts, and their legs projecting stiffly behind them."Pwoy don't yez be satisfoied wid a few av th' whoite wans, Frankie?""They're handsome," admitted Frank; "but a golden heron is worth a large
sum as a curiosity, and I mean to have one.""All roight, me b'y; have yer own way, lad.""He'll do that, anyhow," mumbled Professor Scotch, gruffly.They could now see long, soldier-like lines of herons stretched out
along the reedy swales, standing still and solemn, like pickets on duty.They were not particularly wary or wild, for they had not been hunted
very much in the wild region which they inhabited.Little green herons were plentiful, and they kept flying up before the
canoe constantly, scaring the others, till Frank grew very impatient,
declaring:

"Those little rascals will scare away a golden heron, if we are
fortunate enough to come upon one."Let me shoot a few of th' varmints," urged Barney, reaching for one of
the guns in the bottom of the canoe."Think what the report of a gun
would do here.muttered the Irish lad, reluctantly relinquishing his hold
on the gun."Av ye soay kape still, kape still it is."Frank instructed the professor to take in his paddle, and Barney was
directed to hold the canoe close to the edge of the rushes.In this
manner, with Frank kneeling in the prow, an arrow ready notched on the
string, he could shoot with very little delay.Beyond the heron rookery the waterway wound into the depths of a dark,
forbidding region, where the Spanish moss hung thick, and the great
trees leaned over the water.They had glided past one side of the rookery and were near this dark
opening when an exclamation of surprise came from Frank Merriwell's
lips."Phat is it, me b'y?""There must be other hunters near at hand," said the professor."The canoe is not drawn up to the bank," said Frank, in a puzzled way."It seems to be floating at some distance from the shore.""Why should it be moored in such a place?There are no tides here, and
alligators are not liable to steal canoes.""Do ye see inny soign av a camp, Frankie?""Not a sign of a camp or a human being.A strange feeling of wonder that swiftly changed to awe was creeping
over them.The canoe was snowy white, and lay perfectly motionless on
the still surface of the water.It was in the dark shadow beneath the
trees."Perhaps the owner of the canoe is lying in the bottom," suggested the
professor."We'll see about that," said Frank, putting down the bow and arrow and
taking up a paddle.With the very first stroke in that direction a most astonishing thing
happened.The white canoe seemed to swing slightly about, and then, with no
visible occupant and no apparent motive power, it glided smoothly and
gently toward the dark depths of the black forest!"There must be a
strong current there!""Nivver a bit is she floating!"Oi fale me hair shtandin' on me head!"Look at the
ripple that spreads from her prow!""But--but," spluttered Professor Scotch, "what is making her move--what
is propelling her?"came from Frank, "but it's a mystery I mean to
solve!Keep straight after that canoe,
Barney.We'll run her down and look her over."Then a strange race began, canoe against canoe, the one in the lead
apparently empty, the one pursuing containing three persons who were
using all their strength and skill to overtake the empty craft.[Illustration: "The white canoe had stopped, and was lying calmly on the
inky surface of the shadowed water."(See page 147)]




CHAPTER XXVI.snorted Barney, in disgust, great drops of perspiration rolling
down his face."As if we wurn't pullin'!""The white canoe keeps just so far ahead."it's not our fault at all, at all."Indeed, no matter how hard they worked, no matter how fast they made the
canoe fly through the water, they could not gain on the mysterious white
canoe.The distance between the two canoes seemed to remain just the
same, and the one in advance slipped through the water without a sound,
following the winding water course beneath the dark trees and going
deeper and deeper into the heart of the swamp.Other water courses were passed, running away into unknown and
unexplorable wilds.It grew darker and darker, and the feeling of awe
and fear fell more heavily upon them.At last, exhausted and discouraged, the professor stopped paddling,
crying to his companions, in a husky voice:

"Stop, boys, stop!There is something supernatural about that fiendish
boat!It is luring us to some frightful fate!""You are not superstitious--you
have said so at least a score of times.""That's all right," returned Scotch, shaking his head."I do not take
any stock in rappings, table tippings, and that kind of stuff, but I
will confess this is too much for me."Oi don't wonder at thot," gurgled Barney Mulloy, wiping the
great drops of perspiration from his forehead."It's the divvil's own
canoe, thot is sure!""Thin ixplain it fer me, me b'y--ixplain it.""Oh, I won't say that I can explain it, for I do not pretend to
understand it; but I'll wager that the mystery would be readily solved
if we could overtake and examine that canoe.""Mebbe so; but I think it nades a stameboat to overtake it."Professor Scotch shook his head in a most solemn manner."Boys," he said, "in all my career I have never seen anything like this,
and I shall never dare tell this adventure, for people in general would
not believe it--they'd think I was lying.""And, still I will wager that the
explanation of the whole matter would seem very simple if we could
overtake that canoe and examine it.""I am surprised at you, professor--I am more than surprised.""I can't help it if you are, my boy.""I am afraid your mind is beginning to weaken.""Soay, Frankie," broke in Barney."Oi loike fun as well as th' nixt wan,
but, be jabbers!it's nivver a bit av it can Oi see in this!"cried the professor, pointing at the mystic
craft."It has stopped out there in the shadows.""And seems to be waiting for us to pursue again.""I am not," decisively declared Professor Scotch."It's enough av this
koind av business Oi've been in!""We'll turn about," said Scotch, grimly."That canoe will lure us into
this dismal swamp so far that we'll never find our way out."I suppose I'll have to give up, but I do dislike
to leave without solving the mystery of that canoe.""It may be thot we're so far in thot we can't foind our way out at all,
at all," said the Irish lad."I'm afraid we'll not be able to get out before nightfall," confessed
the professor."I have no fancy for spending a night in this swamp."Barney promptly expressed his dislike for such an adventure, but Frank
was silent.The canoe turned about, and they set about the task of retracing the
water courses by which they had come far into the swamp.It was not long before they came to a place where the courses divided.Frank was for following one, while both Barney and the professor
insisted that the other was the right way.Finally, Frank gave in to them, although it was against his better
judgment, and he felt that he should not submit.They had not proceeded far before, as they were passing round a bend, a
cry of astonishment fell from Barney's lips.Th' thing is afther follying av us!"They looked back, and, sure enough, there was the mysterious canoe,
gliding after them, like a most uncanny thing!said Frank, in a tone that plainly indicated he did
not like it.throbbed the professor, splashing his paddle into the
water and very nearly upsetting them all."Don't let the thing overtake
us!"Oi think it's a foine plan to be gettin' out av this," muttered Barney,
in an agitated tone of voice."Steady, there, professor," called Frank, sharply."What do you want to
do--drown us all?As long as we could not overtake it, let it overtake us."Th' skame won't worruck, me b'y.Th' ould thing's shtopped."It was true; the white canoe had stopped, and was lying calmly on the
inky surface of the shadowed water."Well, I can't say that I like this," said Frank."And I scarcely think I like it more than you do," came from the
professor."An' th' both av yez loike it as well as mesilf," put in the Irish
youth.Go on they did, but the white canoe still followed, keeping at a
distance."I can't stand this," declared Frank, as he picked up a rifle from the
bottom of the canoe."I wonder how lead will work on her?""Pwhat are yez goin' to do, me b'y?""Shoot a few holes in that craft," was the deliberate answer."Swing to
the left, so that I may have a good chance.""No telling what'll come of it if you shoot.""I'll simply put a few holes through that canoe.""It may sind us all to glory by th' farrust express."Swing her to the left, I say.I am going to
shoot, and that settles it."It was useless for them to urge him not to fire; he was determined, and
nothing they could say would change his mind.The canoe drifted round to
the left, and the rifle rose to Frank's shoulder.The clear report rang out and echoed through the cypress forest.The bullet tore through the white canoe, and the weird craft seemed to
give a leap, like a wounded creature.echoed the professor, quivering with terror.groaned Barney Mulloy, his face white and his eyes staring."She is turning about--she is going to leave us!Up the rifle came, but, just as he pressed the trigger, Professor Scotch
pushed the weapon to one side, so the bullet did not pass within twenty
feet of the white canoe."I couldn't see you shoot into that canoe again," faltered the agitated
professor.He could not explain, and he was
ashamed of his agitation and fears."Well, you fellows lay over anything I ever went up against!""I didn't suppose you could be so thoroughly
childish.""All right, Frank," came humbly from the professor's lips."I can't help
it, and I haven't a word to say.""But I will take one more shot at that canoe!""Not this day," chuckled Barney Mulloy.The mysterious canoe had vanished from view while they were
speaking.The exclamations came from Frank and Professor Scotch.Barney's chuckle changed to a shiver, and his teeth chattered."Th' Ould B'y's in it!""The Old Boy must have been in that canoe," agreed the professor.He still refused to believe there
was anything supernatural about the mysterious, white canoe, but he was
forced to acknowledge to himself that the craft had done most amazing
things."It simply slipped into some branch waterway while we were not looking,"
he said, speaking calmly, as if it were the most commonplace thing
imaginable."Well, it's gone," said Scotch, as if greatly relieved."Now, let's get
out of this in a great hurry.""I am for going back to see what has become of the white canoe," said
Frank, with deliberate intent to make his companions squirm.Barney and the professor raised a perfect howl of protest.shouted Scotch, nearly upsetting the boat in his excitement,
and wildly flourishing his arms in the air."Oi'll joomp overboard an' swim out av
this before Oi'll go back!""I suppose I'll have to give in to
you, as you are two to one.""Come on," fluttered the professor; "let's be moving."So Frank put down the rifle, and picked up his paddle, and they resumed
their effort to get out of the swamp before nightfall.But the afternoon was well advanced, and night was much nearer than they
had thought, as they were soon to discover.At last, Barney cried:

"Oi see loight enough ahead!We must be near out av th' woods."For a long time he had been certain they were on the
wrong course, but he hoped it would bring them out somewhere.He had
noted the light that indicated they were soon to reach the termination
of the cypress swamp, but he held his enthusiasm in check till he could
be sure they had come out somewhere near where they had entered the
dismal region."What do you think now,
young man?Do you mean to say that we don't know our business?What if
we had accepted your way of getting out of the swamp!We'd been in there
now, sir.""Don't crow till you're out of the woods," advised Frank.Oi belave he'd be plazed av we didn't get out at all, at all!"In a short time they came to the termination of the cypress woods, but,
to the surprise of Barney and the professor, the swamp, overgrown with
tall rushes and reed-grass, continued, with the water course winding
away through it."Pwhat th' ould boy does this mane?""It means," said Frank, coolly, "that we have reached the Everglades."Well, pwhat do we want iv thim, Oi dunno?""They are one of the sights of Florida, Barney.""It's soights enough I've seen alreddy.Oi'd loike ter git out av this.""I knew you wouldn't get out this way, for we have not passed the
rookeries of the herons, as you must remember.""That's true," sighed the professor, dejectedly."Turn about, and retrace our steps," said Frank.But Barney and the professor raised a vigorous protest."Nivver a bit will yez get me inther thot swamp again th' doay!"shouted
the Irish lad, in a most decisive manner."If we go back, we'll not be able to get out before darkness comes on,
and we'll have to spend the night in the swamp," said Scotch, excitedly."Well, what do you propose to do?""I don't seem
to have anything to say in this matter.You are running it to suit
yourselves."They were undecided, but one thing was certain; they would not go back
into the swamp.The white canoe was there, and the professor and the
Irish lad did not care to see that again."We're out av th' woods, an',
by follyin' this strame, we ought to get out av th' Iverglades."asked Frank, who was rather enjoying the
adventure, although he did not fancy the idea of spending a night on the
marsh."Go on--by all means, go on!"We'll proceed to explore the Everglades in company
with Professor Scotch, the noted scientist and daring adventurer.So they pushed onward into the Everglades, while the sun sank lower and
lower, finally dropping beneath the horizon.Night was coming on, and they were in the heart of the Florida
Everglades!Barney and the professor fell to growling at each other, and they kept
it up while Frank smiled and remained silent.At length, Scotch took in his paddle in disgust, groaning:

"We're lost!""I am inclined to think so myself," admitted Frank, cheerfully."Well, who's to blame, Oi'd loike to know?"roared the professor, like a wounded lion."It's yersilf thot is to blame!Frankie wanted to go the other woay, but ye said no."You
insisted that this was the proper course to pursue!"Profissor, ye're a little oulder thin Oi be, but av ye wur nigh me age,
Oi'd inform ye thot ye didn't know how to spake th' truth.""Do you mean to call me a liar, you impudent young rascal?""Not now, profissor; but I would av ye wur younger.""Well, pwhat are yez goin' to do about it?""I'll make you swallow the words, you scoundrel!""Well, thot would be more av a male thin the rist av ye are loikely to
get th' noight, so it is!""Come, come," laughed Frank; "this is no time nor place to quarrel.""You're right, Frank; but this ungrateful young villain makes me very
tired!""Excuse me, but you know human beings are influenced by their
surroundings and associates.If I have----"

"Professor!""You would not accuse me of
having taught you to use slang?"No, no--that is, you see--er--well, er, that Dutch boy
was always saying something slangy."Quite a joke--quite a little joke, you
know!As under the circumstances there was nothing else to do, they finally
paddled slowly forward, looking for a piece of dry land, where they
could stop and camp for the night.They approached a small cluster of trees, which rose above the rushes,
and it was seen that they seemed to be growing on land that was fairly
high and dry."It's not likely we'll find another
place like that anywhere in the Everglades."As they came nearer, they saw the trees seemed to be growing on an
island, for the water course divided and ran on either side of them."This is really a
very interesting and amusing adventure.""It may be for you," groaned the professor; "but you forget that it is
said to be possible for persons to lose themselves in the Everglades and
never find their way out.""On the contrary, I remember it quite well.In fact, it is said that,
without a guide, the chances of finding a way out of the Everglades is
small, indeed.""Well, what do you feel so exuberant about?""Why, the possibility that we'll all perish in the Everglades adds zest
to this adventure--makes it really interesting.""Frank, you're a puzzle to me.You are cautious about running into
danger of any sort, but, once in it, you seem to take a strange and
unaccountable delight in the peril.The greater the danger, the happier
you seem to feel.""Thot's roight," nodded Barney."When I am not in danger, my good judgment tells me to take no chances;
but when I get into it fairly, I know the only thing to be done is to
make the best of it.I delight in adventure--I was born for it!"A dismal sound came from the professor's throat."When your uncle died," said Scotch, "I thought him my friend.Although
we had quarreled, I fancied the hatchet was buried.He made me your
guardian, and I still believed he had died with nothing but friendly
feelings toward me.But he knew you, and now I believe it was an act of
malice toward me when he made me your guardian.And, to add to my
sufferings, he decreed that I should travel with you.Asher Dow
Merriwell deliberately plotted against my life!He knew the sort of a
career you would lead me, and he died chuckling in contemplation of the
misery and suffering you would inflict upon me!That man was a
monster--an inhuman wretch!"cried Barney, pointing toward the small, timbered island."May Ould Nick floy away wid me av it ain't a house!"In a little clearing on some rising ground amid the trees they could see
the hut."It looks as if some one stops here at times, at least," said Frank."Av this ain't a clear case av luck, Oi dunno mesilf!""We'll get the man who lives there to guide us out of the Everglades!"shouted the professor, in a relieved tone.Then Frank cast a gloom over their spirits by saying:

"This may be a hunter's cabin, inhabited only at certain seasons of the
year.Ten to one, there's no one living in it now.""You'd be pleased if there wasn't!""We'll soon find out if there's any one at home," he said, as the canoe
ran up to the bank, and he took care to get out first.As soon as Frank was out, the professor made a scramble to follow him.He rose to his feet, despite Barney's warning cry, and, a moment later,
the cranky craft flipped bottom upward, with the swiftness of a flash of
lightning.The professor and the Irish lad disappeared beneath the surface of the
water.Barney's head popped up in a moment, and he stood upon his feet, with
the water to his waist, uttering some very vigorous words.Up came the professor, open flew his mouth, out spurted a stream of
water, and then he wildly roared:

"Help!Before either of the boys could say a word, he went under again."This is th' firrust toime Oi iver saw a man thot wanted to drown in
thray fate av wather," said Barney.Frank sat down on the dry ground, and shouted with laughter.he bellowed, after he had spurted another big stream of water
from his mouth."Will you see me perish before your very eyes?But Frank was laughing so heartily that he could not say a word, and the
little man went down once more.For the third time the professor's head appeared above the surface, and
the professor's voice weakly called:

"Will no one save me?This is a plot to get me out of the way!May you be happy
when I am gone!"shouted Frank, seeing that the little man had actually
resigned himself to drown.The professor stood up, and an expression of pain, surprise, and disgust
settled on his face, as he thickly muttered:

"May I be kicked!And I've been under the water two-thirds of the time
for the last hour!I've swallowed more than two barrels of this
swamp-water, including, in all probability, a few dozen pollywogs,
lizards, young alligators, and other delightful things!If the water
wasn't so blamed dirty here, and I wasn't afraid of swallowing enough
creatures to start an aquarium, I'd just lie down and refuse to make
another effort to get up."Then he waded out, the look on his face causing Frank to double up with
merriment, while even the wretched Barney smiled.Barney would have waded out, but Frank said:

"Don't attempt to land without those guns, old man.They're somewhere on
the bottom, and we want them."So Barney was forced to plunge under the surface and feel around till he
had fished up the rifles and the shotgun.Frank had taken care of his bow and arrows, the latter being in a quiver
at his back, and the paddles had not floated away.After a time, everything was recovered, the canoe was drawn out and
tipped bottom upward, and the trio moved toward the cabin, Frank
leading, and the professor staggering along behind.Reaching the cabin, Frank rapped loudly on the door.Once more he knocked, and then, as there was no reply, he pushed the
door open, and entered.The cabin was not occupied by any living being, but a glance showed the
trio that some one had been there not many hours before, for the embers
of a fire still glowed dimly on the open hearth of flat stones.There were two rooms, the door between them being open, so the little
party could look into the second.The first room seemed to be the principal room of the hut, while the
other was a bedroom.They could see the bed through the open doorway.There were chairs, a table, a couch, and other things, for the most part
rude, home-made stuff, and still every piece showed that the person who
constructed it had skill and taste.Around the walls were hung various tin pans and dishes, all polished
bright and clean.What surprised them the most was the wire screens in the windows, a
screen door that swung inward, and a mosquito-bar canopy over the bed
and the couch.cried Frank; "the person who lives here is prepared to
protect himself against mosquitoes and black flies.""It would be impossible to live here in the summer," gravely declared
Professor Scotch, forgetting his own misery for the moment."The pests
would drive a man crazy.""Oh, I don't know about that," returned Frank."If a man knew how to
defend himself against them he might get along all right.They can't be
worse than the mosquitoes of Alaska in the warm months.Up there the
Indians get along all right, even though mosquitoes have been known to
kill a bear."Oh, Frankie, me b'y, Oi
nivver thought that av you!""Sometimes bears, lured by
hunger, will come down into the lowlands, where mosquitoes will attack
them.They will stand up on their hind legs and strike at the little
pests with their forward paws.Sometimes a bear will do this till he is
exhausted and falls."Thot's a harrud yarn to belave, profissor; but it goes av you soay so,"
said Barney, thinking it best to smooth over the late unpleasantness."Up there," said Frank, "the Indians smear their faces and hands with
some kind of sticky stuff that keeps the mosquitoes from reaching their
flesh.But they had something to talk about besides the Indians of Alaska, for
the surprises around them furnished topics for conversation.Exploring the place, they found it well stocked with provisions, which
caused them all to feel delighted."It will be all right if we are able to get out of the scrape," said
Scotch.Barney built a fire, while Frank prepared to make bread and cook supper,
having found everything necessary for the accomplishment of the task.The professor stripped off his outer garments, wrung the water out of
them, and hung them up before the fire to dry.They made themselves as comfortable as possible, and night came on,
finding them in a much better frame of mind than they had expected to
be.Frank succeeded in baking some bread in the stone oven.He found
coffee, and a pot bubbled on the coals, sending out an odor that made
the trio feel ravenous.There were candles in abundance, and two of them were lighted.Then,
when everything was ready, they sat down to the table and enjoyed a
supper that put them in the best of moods.The door of the hut was left open, and the light shone out upon the
overturned canoe and the dark water beyond.After supper they cleaned and dried the rifles and shotgun.laughed Frank; "this is a regular picnic!I'm glad we took
the wrong course, and came here!""You may change your tune before we get out," said the professor, whose
trousers were dry, and who was now feeling of his coat to see how that
was coming on."Don't croak, profissor," advised Barney."You're th' firrust mon Oi
iver saw thot wuz bound ter drown himsilf in thray fate av wather."Oh, laugh, laugh," snapped the little man, fiercely."I'll get even
with you for that some time!After supper they lay around and took things easy.Barney and Frank told
stories till it was time to go to bed, and they finally turned in, first
having barred the door and made sure the windows were securely fastened.They soon slept, but they were not to rest quietly through the night.Other mysterious things were soon to follow those of the day.The boys leaped to their feet, and the professor came tearing out of the
bedroom, ran into the table, which he overturned with a great clatter of
dishes, reeled backward, and sat down heavily on the floor, where he
rubbed his eyes, and muttered:

"I thought that fire engine was going to run me down before I could get
out of the way.""Who ever heard of a fire engine
in the heart of the Florida Everglades?""Oi herrud th' gong," declared Barney."I heard something that sounded like a fire gong," admitted Frank."Pwhat was it, Oi dunno?""It seemed to come from beneath the head of the bed in there," said
Scotch."An' Oi thought I herrud it under me couch out here," gurgled Barney."We will light a candle, and look around," said Frank.A candle was lighted, and they looked for the cause of the midnight
alarm, but they found nothing that explained the mystery."It's afther gettin' away from here we'd
better be, mark me worrud.""It's spooks there be around this place, ur Oi'm mistaken!""Oh, I've heard enough about spooks!The professor was silent, but he shook his head in a very mysterious
manner, as if he thought a great many things he did not care to speak
about.They had been thoroughly awakened, but, after a time, failing to
discover what had aroused them, they decided to return to bed.Five minutes after they lay down, Frank and the professor were brought
to their feet by a wild howl and a thud.They rushed out of the bedroom,
and nearly fell over Barney, who was lying in the middle of the floor,
at least eight feet from the couch.palpitated the Irish lad, thickly."Oi wur jist beginning to get slapy whin something grabbed me an' threw
me clan out here in th' middle av th' room.""Oi'll swear to it, Frankie--Oi'll swear on a stack av Boibles.""You dreamed it, Barney; that's what's the matter.""Nivver a drame, me b'y, fer Oi wasn't aslape at all, at all.""But you may have been asleep, for you say you were beginning to get
sleepy."Oi dunno about thot, Frankie.Oi'm incloined to belave th' Ould B'y's
around, so Oi am.""Nivver a bit will Oi troy to slape on thot couch again th' noight, me
b'y.Oi'll shtay roight here on th' flure.""Sleep where you like, but keep still.Frank was somewhat nettled by these frequent interruptions of his rest,
and he was more than tempted to give Barney cause to believe the hut was
really haunted, for he was an expert ventriloquist, and he could have
indulged in a great deal of sport with the Irish boy.But other things were soon to take up their attention.While they were
talking a strange humming arose on every side and seemed to fill the
entire hut.At first, it was like a swarm of bees, but it grew louder
and louder till it threatened to swell into a roar.Professor Scotch was nearly frightened out of his wits.he shrieked, making a wild dash for the
door, which he flung wide open.But the professor did not rush out of the cabin.Instead, he flung up
his hands, staggered backward, and nearly fell to the floor.he faintly gasped, clutching at empty air for
support.Frank sprang forward, catching and steadying the professor.Sure enough, on the dark surface of the water, directly in front of the
hut, lay the mysterious canoe.And now this singular craft was illuminated from stem to stern by a
soft, white light that showed its outlines plainly."Sint Patherick presarve us!""I am getting tired of being chased around by a canoe!"said Frank, in
disgust, as he hastily sought one of the rifles."Av yer do, our goose is cooked!"Frank threw a fresh cartridge into the rifle, and turned toward the open
door, his mind fully made up.And then, to the profound amazement of all three, seated in the canoe
there seemed to be an old man, with white hair and long, white beard.The soft, white light seemed to come from every part of his person, as
it came from the canoe.Frank Merriwell paused, with the rifle partly lifted."It's th' spook himsilf!"gasped Barney, covering his face with his
hands, and clinging to the professor."For mercy's sake, don't shoot,
Frank!Frank was startled and astonished, but he was determined not to lose his
nerve, no matter what happened.The man in the canoe seemed to be looking directly toward the cabin.He
slowly lifted one hand, and pointed away across the Everglades, at the
same time motioning with the other hand, as if for them to go in that
direction."I'll just send a bullet over his head, to see what he thinks of it,"
said Frank, softly, lifting the rifle.Canoe and man disappeared in the twinkling of an eye!The trio in the hut gasped and rubbed their eyes."An' now Oi suppose ye'll say it wur no ghost?"It was extremely dark beneath the shadow of the cypress trees, and not a
sign of the mysterious canoe could they see."It is evident he did not care to have me send a bullet whizzing past
his ears," laughed Frank, who did not seem in the least disturbed.demanded Professor Scotch, in a shaking
tone of voice.Frank's hand fell on the professor's arm, and the three listened
intently, hearing something that gave them no little surprise.From far away through the night came the sound of hoarse voices singing
a wild, doleful song."Pwhat the Ould Nick does thot mane?""Let's see if we can understand the words
they are singing."We sailed away from Gloucester Bay,
      And the wind was in the west, yo ho!And her cargo was some New England rum;
      Our grog it was made of the best, yo ho!""A sailor's song," decided Frank, "and those are sailors who are
singing.We are not alone in the Everglades.""They're all drunk," declared the professor."You can tell that by the
sound of their voices."They're a blamed soight betther than none, fer it's loikely they know
th' way out av this blissed swamp," said Barney."They may bub-bub-be pup-pup-pup-pirates!""What sticks me," said Frank, "is how a party of sailors ever made their
way in here, for we are miles upon miles from the coast."Are ye fer takin' a look at th' loikes av thim, Frankie?""I am not going near those ruffianly and bloodthirsty pirates.""Then you may stay here with the spooks, while Barney and I go."This was altogether too much for the professor, and, when he found they
really intended to go, he gave in.Frank loaded the rifles and the shotgun, and took along his bow and
arrows, even though Barney made sport of him for bothering with the
last.They slipped the canoe into the water, and, directed by Frank, the
professor succeeded in getting in without upsetting the frail affair."Oi hope we won't run inther the ghost," uttered the Irish boy."The sound of that singing comes from the direction in which the old man
seemed to point," said Frank.The singing continued, sometimes sinking to a low, droning sound,
sometimes rising to a wild wail that sounded weirdly over the marshland."Ready," said Frank, and the canoe slipped silently over the dark
surface of the water course.The singing ceased after a time, but they were still guided by the sound
of wrangling voices."This is tut-tut-terrible!"Suddenly the sound of a pistol shot came over the rushes, followed by a
feminine shriek of pain or terror!As soon as he
could recover, Frank asked:

"Did you hear that?""It sounded very much like the voice of a woman or girl," said Professor
Scotch, who was so amazed that he forgot for the moment that he was
scared."That's what it was," declared Frank; "and it means that our aid is
needed in that quarter at once.""There's no telling
what kind of a gang we may run into."grated Barney Mulloy, quivering with eagerness."There's a female in nade av hilp."directed Frank, giving utterance to his old maxim.The professor was too agitated to handle a paddle, so the task of
propelling the canoe fell to the boys, who sent it skimming over the
water, Frank watching out for snags.In a moment the water course swept round to the left, and they soon saw
the light of a fire gleaming through the rushes.The sounds of a conflict continued, telling them that the quarrel was
still on, and aiding them in forming their course.In a moment they came in full view of the camp-fire, by the light of
which they saw several struggling, swaying figures.Frank's keen eyes seemed to take in everything at one sweeping glance.Six men and a girl were revealed by the light of the fire.Five of the
men were engaged in a fierce battle, while the sixth was bound, in a
standing position, to the trunk of a tree.The girl, with her hands bound behind her back, was standing near the
man who was tied to the tree, and the firelight fell fairly on the faces
of man and girl.A low exclamation of the utmost astonishment broke from Frank's lips."It can't be--it is an impossibility!""Pwhat is it, me b'y?"That is Captain Justin Bellwood,
whose vessel was lost in the storm off Fardale coast!"An' th' girrul is----"

"Elsie Bellwood, his daughter!""Th' wan you saved from th' foire, Frankie?""Captain Bellwood
has a new vessel, and he would not be here."But how----"

"There has been some kind of trouble, and they are captives--that is
plain enough.Those men are sailors--Captain Bellwood's sailors!It's
likely there has been a mutiny."We must land while those ruffians are fighting.If
we can get ashore, we'll set the captain free, and I fancy we'll be able
to hold our own with those ruffians, desperate wretches though they
are.""Perhaps they will kill each other,
and then our part will be easy."Frank was not for waiting, but, at that moment, something happened that
caused him to change his plan immediately.The fighting ruffians were using knives in a deadly way, and one man,
bleeding from many wounds, fell exhausted to the ground.Another, who
seemed to be this one's comrade, tore himself from the other three,
leaped to the girl, caught her in his arms, and held her in front of
him, so that her body shielded his.Then, pointing a revolver over her
shoulder, he snarled:

"Come on, and I'll bore the three of ye!You can't shoot me, Gage,
unless you kill ther gal!"The youngest one of the party, a mere boy, but a fellow with the air of
a desperado, stepped to the front, saying swiftly:

"If you don't drop that girl, Jaggers, you'll leave your carcass in this
swamp!Frank clapped a hand over his mouth to keep from uttering a great shout
of amazement.The next moment he panted:

"This is fate!by the eternal skies, that is Leslie Gage,
my worst enemy at Fardale Academy, and the fellow who ran away to keep
from being expelled.It was reported that he had gone to sea.""Ye're roight, Frankie," agreed the no less excited Irish lad."It's
thot skunk, an' no mistake!""It is Leslie Gage," agreed the professor."He was ever a bad boy, but I
did not think he would come to this.""An' Oi always thought he would come to some bad ind.It wur thot
spalpane thot troied to run Frank through with a sharpened foil wan
toime whin they wur fencing.He had black murder in his hearrut thin,
an' it's not loikely th' whilp has grown inny betther since."The man with the girl laughed defiantly, retorting:

"You talk big, Gage, but it won't work with me.I hold the best hand
just at present, and you'll have to come to terms."You don't dare shoot," returned the young desperado, as he took still
another step toward the sailor.In a moment the man placed the muzzle of the revolver against the temple
of the helpless girl, fiercely declaring:

"If you come another inch, I'll blow her brains out!"I will fix him, or
my name is not Merriwell!"He drew an arrow from the quiver, and fitted the notch to the
bow-string.His nerves were steady, and he was determined.He waited
till the man had removed the muzzle of the weapon from the girl's
temple, and then he lifted the bow.They longed to check
Frank, but dared not speak for fear of causing him to waver and send the
arrow at the girl.The bow was bent, the line was taut, the arrow was drawn to the head,
and then----

Twang!The arrow sped through the air, but it was too dark for them to
follow its flight with their eyes.With their hearts in their mouths,
they awaited the result.Of a sudden, the ruffian uttered a cry of pain, released his hold on the
girl, and fell heavily to the ground.The firelight showed the arrow sticking in his shoulder.grunted a voice close beside the canoe."Very good shot for a
white boy.The trio turned in amazement and alarm, and, within three feet of them,
they saw a shadowy canoe that contained a shadowy figure.There was but
one person in the strange canoe, and he immediately added:

"There is no need to fear Socato, the Seminole, for he will not harm
you.He is the friend of all good white men."It was an Indian, a Seminole, belonging to the remnant of the once great
nation that peopled the Florida peninsula.Frank realized this in a
moment, and, knowing the Seminoles were harmless when well treated, felt
no further alarm.The Indian had paddled with the utmost silence to their side, while they
were watching what was taking place on shore.The arrow had produced consternation in the camp.The fellow who was
wounded tried to draw it from his shoulder, groaning:

"This is not a fair deal!Give me a fair show, and I'll fight you all!"The two canoes were beyond the circle of firelight, so they could not be
seen from the shore.Gage's two companions were overcome with terror."We've been attacked
by a band of savages!"Gage spoke a few words in a low tone, and then sprang over the prostrate
form of the man who had been stricken down by the arrow, grasped the
girl, and retreated into the darkness.His companions also scudded
swiftly beyond the firelight, leaving Captain Bellwood still bound to
the tree, while one man lay dead on the ground, and another had an arrow
in his shoulder.Close to Frank's ear the voice of Socato the Seminole sounded:

"Light bother them.They git in the dark and see us from the shore.gasped Professor Scotch, "I don't care to stay here,
and have them shoot at me!""Of course we will pay," hastily answered Frank."Can you aid us in
saving her?If you can, you shall be----"

"Socato save her.White man and two boys go back to cabin of Great White
Phantom.Stay there, and Socato come with the girl."Oi don't loike thot," declared Barney."Oi'd loike to take a
hand in th' rescue mesilf.""Socato can do better alone," asserted the Seminole.But Frank was not inclined to desert Elsie Bellwood in her hour of
trouble, and he said:

"Socato, you must take me with you.Professor, you and Barney go back to
the hut, and stay there till we come."The Indian hesitated, and then said:

"If white boy can shoot so well with the bow and arrow, he may not be in
the way.I will take him, if he can step from one canoe to the other
without upsetting either.""That's easy," said Frank, as he deliberately and safely accomplished
the feat."Well done, white boy," complimented the strange Indian."Pass me one of those rifles," requested Frank."White boy better leave rifle; take bow and arrows," advised Socato."Rifle make noise; bow and arrow make no noise."Return to the hut, Barney, and stay there
till we show up.""But th' spook----"

"Hang the spook!We'll know where to find you, if you go there.""The Great White Phantom will not harm those who offer him no harm,"
declared the Indian."I am not so afraid of spooks as I am of---- Jumping Jupiter!"There was a flash of fire from the darkness on shore, the report of a
gun, and a bullet whirred through the air, cutting the professor's
speech short, and causing him to duck down into the canoe."Those fellows have located us," said Frank, swiftly.Socato's paddle dropped without a sound into the water, and the canoe
slid away into the night.The professor and Barney lost no time in moving, and it was well they
did so, for, a few seconds later, another shot came from the shore, and
the bullet skipped along the water just where the canoes had been.Frank trusted everything to Socato, even though he had never seen or
heard of the Seminole before.Something about the voice of the Indian
convinced the boy that he was honest, for all that his darkness was such
that Frank could not see his face and did not know how he looked.The Indian sent the canoe through the water with a speed and silence
that was a revelation to Frank Merriwell.The paddle made no sound, and
it seemed that the prow of the canoe scarcely raised a ripple, for all
that they were gliding along so swiftly.whispered Frank, observing that they were leaving
the camp-fire astern."If I didn't, I shouldn't be here.Socato take him round to place where we can come up
behind bad white men.The light of the camp-fire died out, and then, a few moments later,
another camp-fire seemed to glow across a strip of low land.What party is camped there--friends of yours, Socato?"We left that fire behind us, Socato.""And we have come round by the water till it is before us again."This was true, but the darkness had been so intense that Frank did not
see how their course was changing."I see how you mean to come up behind them," said the boy."You are
going to land and cross to their camp."Soon the rushes closed in on either side, and the Indian sent the canoe
twisting in and out amid their tall stalks like a creeping panther.He
seemed to know every inch of the way, and followed it as well as if it
were broad noonday.Frank's admiration for the fellow grew with each moment, and he felt
that he could, indeed, trust Socato."If we save that girl and the old man, you shall be well paid for the
job," declared the boy, feeling that it was well to dangle a reward
before the Indian's mental vision."It is good," was the whispered retort.In a few moments they crept through the rushes till the canoe lay close
to a bank, and the Indian directed Frank to get out.The camp-fire could not be seen from that position, but the boy well
knew it was not far away.Taking his bow, with the quiver of arrows slung to his back, the lad
left the canoe, being followed immediately by the Seminole, who lifted
the prow of the frail craft out upon the bank, and then led the way.Passing round a thick mass of reeds, they soon reached a position where
they could see the camp-fire and the moving forms of the sailors.Just
as they reached this position, Leslie Gage was seen to dash up to the
fire and kick the burning brands in various directions."He has done that so that the firelight might not reveal them to us,"
thought Frank."They still believe us near, although they know not where
we are."Crouching and creeping, Socato led the way, and Frank followed closely,
wondering what scheme the Indian could have in his head, yet trusting
everything to his sagacity.In a short time they were near enough to hear the conversation of the
bewildered and alarmed sailors.The men were certain a band of savages
were close at hand, for they did not dream that the arrow which had
dropped Jaggers was fired by the hand of a white person."The sooner we get away from here, the better it will be for us,"
declared Leslie Gage."We'll have to get away in the boats," said a grizzled
villainous-looking, one-eyed old sailor, who was known as Ben Bowsprit."Fo' de Lawd's sake!"gasped the third sailor, who was a <DW64>, called
Black Tom; "how's we gwine to run right out dar whar de critter am dat
fired de arrer inter Jack Jaggers?""The 'critter' doesn't seem to be there any longer," assured Gage."Those two shots must have frightened him away.""That's right," agreed Bowsprit."This has been an unlucky stop fer us,
mates.Tomlinson is dead, an' Jaggers----"

"I ain't dead, but I'm bleedin', bleedin', bleedin'!"moaned the fellow
who had been hit by Frank's arrow."There's a big tear in my shoulder,
an' I'm afeared I've made my last cruise.""It serves you right," came harshly from the boy leader of the ruffianly
crew."Tomlinson attempted to set himself up as head of this crew--as
captain over me.All the time, you knew I was the leader
in every move we have made.""And a pretty pass you have led us to!""Where's the money you said the captain had stored away?Where's the
reward we'd receive for the captain alive and well?We turned mutineers
at your instigation, and what have we made of it?We've set the law
agin' us, an' here we are.The _Bonny Elsie_ has gone up in smoke----"

"Through the carelessness of a lot of drunken fools!"But for that, we wouldn't be here now,
hiding from officers of the law.""Well, here we are," growled Ben Bowsprit, "an' shiver my timbers if we
seem able to get out of this howlin' swamp!The more we try, the more we
seem ter git lost.""Fo' goodness, be yo' gwine to stan' roun' an' chin, an' chin, an'
chin?""The fire's out, and we can't be seen," spoke Gage, swiftly, in a low
tone.You two are to take the old man in one; I'll
take the girl in the other.""It's the gal you've cared fer all the time," cried Jaggers, madly."It
was for her you led us into this scrape."You can't make me shut up, Gage.""Well, you'll have a chance to talk to yourself and Tomlinson before
long."I saw you strike the
blow, and I'll swear to that, my hearty!""It's not likely you'll be given a chance to swear to it, Jaggers.I may
have killed him, but it was in self-defense.He was doing his best to
get his knife into me.""Yes, we was tryin' to finish you," admitted Jaggers."With you out of
the way, Tomlinson would have been cap'n, and I first mate.You've kept
your eyes on the gal all the time.I don't believe you thought the cap'n
had money at all.It was to get the gal you led us into this business.She'd snubbed you--said she despised you, and you made up your mind to
carry her off against her will.""If that was my game, you must confess I succeeded very well.But I
can't waste more time talking to you.Put Cap'n Bellwood in the larger, and look out for
him."Boy though he was, Gage had resolved
to become a leader of men, and he had succeeded.The girl, quite overcome, was prostrate at the feet of her father, who
was bound to the cypress tree.There was a look of pain and despair on the face of the old captain.His
heart bled as he looked down at his wretched daughter, and he groaned:

"Merciful Heaven!It were better that she
should die than remain in the power of that young villain!""What are you muttering about, old man?"coarsely demanded Gage, as he
bent to lift the girl."You seem to be muttering to yourself the greater
part of the time.""Do you
think you can escape the retribution that pursues all such dastardly
creatures as you?"I have found out that the goody-good people do
not always come out on top in this world.Besides that, it's too late
for me to turn back now.I started wrong at school, and I have been
going wrong ever since.It's natural for me; I can't help it.""If you harm her, may the wrath of Heaven fall on your head!"I will be very tender and considerate with her.He attempted to lift her to her feet, but she drew from him, shuddering
and screaming wildly:

"Don't touch me!""Now, don't be a little fool!""You make me sick with
your tantrums!But she screamed the louder, seeming to stand in the utmost terror of
him.With a savage exclamation, Gage tore off his coat and wrapped it about
the girl's head so that her cries were smothered."Perhaps that will keep you still a bit!"he snapped, catching her up in
his arms, and bearing her to the smaller boat, in which he carefully
placed her.As her hands were bound behind her, she could not
remove the coat from about her head, and she sat as he placed her, with
it enveloping her nearly to the waist.Somebody
take Tomlinson's weapons.He may need them when we
are gone.""Don't leave me here to die alone!"piteously pleaded the wounded
sailor."I'm pretty well gone now, but I don't want to be left here
alone!"Gage left the small boat for a moment, and approached the spot where the
pleading wretch lay."Jaggers," he said, "it's the fate you deserve.You agreed to stand by
me, but you went back on your oath, and tried to kill me.""And now you're going to leave me here to bleed to death or starve?"The tables are turned on you, my fine fellow.""Well, I'm sure you won't leave me."Jaggers flung up his hand, from which a spout of flame seemed to leap,
and the report of a pistol sounded over the marsh.Leslie Gage fell in a heap to the ground.Well, he is dead already, for I shot
him through the brain!""That's where you are mistaken, Jaggers," said the cool voice of the
boyish leader of the mutineers."I saw your move, saw the revolver, and
dropped in time to avoid the bullet."A snarl of baffled fury came from the lips of the wounded sailor."See if you can dodge this
bullet!"He would have fired again, but Gage leaped forward in the darkness,
kicked swiftly and accurately, and sent the revolver spinning from the
man's hand."I did mean to have
you taken away, and I was talking to torment you.Now you will stay
here--and die like a dog!"He turned from Jaggers, and hurried back to the boat, in which that
muffled figure silently sat.Captain Bellwood had been released from the tree, and marched to the
other boat, in which he now sat, bound and helpless.They pushed off, settled into their seats, and began rowing.Gage was not long in following, but he wondered at the silence of the
girl who sat in the stern.It could not be that she had fainted, for she
remained in an upright position."Any way to get out of this," was the answer."We will find another
place to camp, but I want to get away from this spot."Not a sound came from beneath the muffled coat."It must be close," thought Gage."I wonder if she can breathe all
right.At last, finding he could keep up with his companions without trouble,
and knowing he would have very little difficulty in overtaking them,
Gage drew in his oars and slipped back toward the muffled figure in the
stern."You must not think too hard of me, Miss Bellwood," he said, pleadingly.I love you far too much for that,
Elsie."He could have sworn that the sound which came from the muffling folds of
the coat was like a smothered laugh, but he knew she was not laughing at
him."I have been wicked and desperate," he went on; "but I was driven to the
life I have led.When I shipped on
your father's vessel it was because I had seen you and knew you were to
be along on the cruise.I loved you at first sight, and I vowed that I
would reform and do better if you loved me in return, Elsie."He was speaking swiftly in a low tone, and his voice betrayed his
earnestness.He passed an arm around the muffled figure, feeling it
quiver within his grasp, and then he continued:

"You did not take kindly to me, but I persisted.Then you repulsed
me--told me you despised me, and that made me desperate.I swore I would
have you, Elsie.Then came the mutiny and the burning of the vessel.Now
we are here, and you are with me.Elsie, you know not how I love you!I
have become an outcast, an outlaw--all for your sake!It must be that he was beginning to break down that icy barrier.She
realized her position, and she would be reasonable."Do not scream, Elsie--do not draw away, darling.Say that you will love
me a little--just a little!"He pulled the coat away, and something came out of the folds and touched
cold and chilling against his forehead.commanded a voice that was full of chuckling laughter."If
you chirp, I'll have to blow the roof of your head off, Gage!"Leslie Gage caught his breath and nearly collapsed into the bottom of
the boat.Indeed, he would have fallen had not a strong hand fastened on
his collar and held him."I don't want to shoot you, Gage," whispered the cool voice."I don't
feel like that, even though you did attempt to take my life once or
twice in the past.You have made me very good natured within the past
few moments.How gently you murmured, 'Do not draw
away, darling; say that you love me a little--just a little!'Really, Gage, you gave me such amusement that I am more than
satisfied with this little adventure.""Still, I can't
place you.""Indeed, you are forgetful, Gage.But it is rather dark, and I don't
suppose you expected to see me here."And you are--Frank Merriwell!"Gage would have shouted the name in his amazement, but Frank's fingers
suddenly closed on the fellow's throat and held back the sound in a
great measure."Now you have guessed it," chuckled Frank.I can forgive you
for the past since you have provided me with so much amusement to-night.How you urged me to learn to love you!But that's too much, Gage; I can
never learn to do that."Leslie ground his teeth, but he was still overcome with unutterable
amazement and wonder.That Frank Merriwell, whom he hated, should appear
there at night in the wilds of the Florida Everglades was like a
miracle.Had some magic of that wild and
dreary region changed her into Frank Merriwell?Little wonder that Gage was dazed and helpless."How in the name of the Evil One did you come here?"he finally asked,
recovering slightly from his stupor.It was the same old merry, boyish laugh
that Gage had heard so often at Fardale, and it filled him with intense
anger, as it had in the days of old."I know you did not expect to see me," murmured Frank, still laughing."I assure you that the Evil One had nothing to do with my appearance
here."I left her in the boat a few moments."I will let you speculate over that question for a while, my fine
fellow.In the meantime, I fancy it will be a good idea to tie you up so
you will not make any trouble.Remember I have a revolver handy, and I
promise that I'll use it if you kick up a row."At this moment, one of the sailors in the other boat called:

"Hello, there, Mr.Gage was tempted to shout for help, but the muzzle of the cold weapon
that touched his forehead froze his tongue to silence.Ben Bowsprit was growing impatient and wondering why Leslie did not
answer.It had occurred to the old tar that it was possible the boy had
deserted them.The voice of Black Tom was heard to say:

"He oughter be right near by us, Ben.'Smighty strange dat feller don'
seem to answer nohow.""We'll pull back, my hearty, and
take a look for our gay cap'n."They were coming back, and Gage was still unbound, although a captive in
Frank Merriwell's clutch.There would not be enough time to bind Gage and
get away.Something must be done to prevent the two sailors from turning
about and rowing back."Gage," whispered Frank, swiftly, "you must answer them.Say, it's all
right, boys; I'm coming right along."Gage hesitated, the longing to shout for help again grasping him.hissed Frank, and the muzzle of the revolver seemed
to bore into Gage's forehead, as if the bullet longed to seek his brain.With a mental curse on the black luck, Gage uttered the words as his
captor had ordered, although they seemed to come chokingly from his
throat."Well, what are ye doing back there so long?""Tell them you're making love," chuckled Frank, who seemed to be hugely
enjoying the affair, to the unspeakable rage of his captive."Ask them
if they don't intend to give you a show at all."Gage did as directed, causing Bowsprit to laugh hoarsely.cackled the old sailor, in the darkness."But
this is a poor time to spend in love-makin', cap'n.Wait till we git
settled down ag'in.Tom an' me'll agree not ter watch ye.""Say, all right; go on," instructed Frank, and Gage did so.In a few seconds, the sound of oars were heard, indicating that the
sailors were obeying instructions.At that moment, while Frank was listening to this sound, Gage believed
his opportunity had arrived, and, being utterly desperate, the young
rascal knocked aside Frank's hand, gave a wild shout, leaped to his
feet, and plunged headlong into the water.It was done swiftly--too swiftly for Frank to shoot, if he had intended
such a thing.But Frank Merriwell had no desire to shoot his former
schoolmate, even though Leslie Gage had become a hardened and desperate
criminal, and so, having broken away, the youthful leader of the
mutineers stood in no danger of being harmed.Frank and Socato had been close at hand when Gage placed Elsie Bellwood
in the boat, and barely was the girl left alone before she was removed
by the Seminole, in whose arms she lay limp and unconscious, having
swooned at last.Then it was that a desire to capture Gage and a wild longing to give the
fellow a paralyzing surprise seized upon Frank."Socato," he whispered, "I am going to trust you to take that girl to
the hut where my friends are to be found.Remember that you shall be
well paid; I give you my word of honor as to that."Have a little racket on my own hook," was the reply."If I lose my
bearings and can't find the hut, I will fire five shots into the air
from my revolver.Have one of my friends answer in a similar manner."Frank took the coat; stepped into the boat, watched till Gage was
approaching, and then muffled his head, sitting in the place where Elsie
had been left.In the meantime, the Seminole was bearing the girl swiftly and silently
away.Thus it came about that Gage made love to Frank Merriwell, instead of
the fair captive he believed was muffled by the coat.When Gage plunged into the water, the small boat rocked and came near
upsetting, but did not go over.But the fellow's cry and the splash had brought the sailors to a halt,
and they soon called back:

"What's the matter?"I rather fancy it will be a good plan to make myself scarce in this
particular locality," muttered Frank.Gage swam under water for some distance, and then, coming to the
surface, he shouted to the men in the leading boat:

"Bowsprit, Black Tom, help!There is an enemy here,
but he is alone!"You will have a fine time
catching me.You have given me great amusement, Gage.I assure you that
I have been highly entertained by your company, and hereafter I shall
consider you an adept in the gentle art of making love."fiercely shouted Gage from the water."You are having your turn
now, but mine will soon come!""I have heard you talk like that before, Gage.It does not seem that you
have yet learned 'the way of the transgressor is hard.'""You'll learn better than to meddle with me!I have longed to meet you
again, Frank Merriwell, and I tell you now that one of us will not leave
this swamp alive!""This is not the first time you have made a promise that you were not
able to keep.Before I leave you, I have this to say: If Captain
Bellwood is harmed in the least, if he is not set at liberty with very
little delay, I'll never rest till you have received the punishment
which your crimes merit."Frank could hear the sailors rowing back, and he felt for the oars,
having no doubt that he would be able to escape them with ease, aided by
the darkness.When Gage stopped rowing to make love to the supposed Elsie he had left
the oars in the rowlocks, drawing them in and laying them across the
boat.In the violent rocking of the boat when the fellow leaped
overboard one of the oars had been lost.Frank was left with a single oar, and his enemies were bearing down upon
him with great swiftness."I wonder if there's a chance to scull this boat?"he coolly speculated,
as he hastened to the stern and made a swift examination.To his satisfaction and relief, he found there was, and the remaining
oar was quickly put to use.Even then Frank felt confident that he would be able to avoid his
enemies in the darkness that lay deep and dense upon the great swamp.He
could hear them rowing, and he managed to skull the light boat along
without making much noise.He did not mind that Gage had escaped; in fact, he was relieved to get
rid of the fellow, although it had been his intention to hold him as
hostage for Captain Bellwood.It was the desire for adventure that had led Frank into the affair, and,
now that it was over so far as surprising Gage was concerned, he was
satisfied to get away quietly.He could hear the sailors calling Gage, who answered from the water, and
he knew they would stop to pick the fellow up, which would give our hero
a still better show of getting away.All this took place, and Frank was so well hidden by the darkness that
there was not one chance in a thousand of being troubled by the
ruffianly crew when another astonishing thing happened.From a point amid the tall rushes a powerful white light gleamed out and
fell full and fair upon the small boat and its single occupant,
revealing Frank as plainly as if by the glare of midday sunlight."What is the meaning of this,
I would like to know?"He was so astonished that he nearly dropped the oar.The sailors were astonished, but the light showed them distinctly, and
Gage snarled."Give me your pistol, Bowsprit!He snatched the weapon from the old tar's hand, took hasty aim, and
fired.Frank Merriwell was seen to fling up his arms and fall heavily into the
bottom of the boat!grated the triumphant young rascal, flourishing the revolver.The mysterious light vanished in the twinkling of an eye, but it had
shone long enough for Gage to do his dastardly work.The sailors were alarmed by the light, and wished to row away; but Gage
raved at them, ordering them to pull down toward the spot where the
other boat lay.After a time, the men recovered enough to do as directed, and the
smaller boat was soon found, rocking lightly on the surface.Running alongside, Gage reached over into the small boat, and his hand
found the boy who was stretched in the bottom.cried the young rascal, gleefully."I'll bet anything I
put the bullet straight through his heart!"And then, as if his own words had brought a sense of it all to him, he
suddenly shuddered with horror, faintly muttering:

"That was murder!"The horror grew upon him rapidly, and he began to wonder that he had
felt delight when he saw Frank Merriwell fall.The shooting had been the
impulse of the moment, and, now that it was done and he realized what it
meant, he would have given much to recall that bullet."I swore that one of us should not leave this
swamp alive, and my oath will not be broken.I hated Frank Merriwell the
first time I saw him, and I have hated him ever since.Now he is out of
my way, and he will never cross my path again."There was a slight stir in the small boat, followed by something like a
gasping moan."He don't seem to be dead yet, cap'n," said Ben Bowsprit."I guess your
aim wasn't as good as you thought.""Oh, I don't think he'll recover very fast," said the youthful rascal,
harshly.He rose and stepped over into the smaller boat."I want to take a look at the chap."You'll find I'm not dead yet!"returned a weak voice, and Frank
Merriwell sat up and grappled with Gage.A snarl of fury came from the lips of the boy desperado."You'll have to fight before you finish me!"But Merriwell seemed weak, and Gage did not find it difficult to handle
the lad at whom he had shot.He forced Frank down into the bottom of the
boat, and then called to his companions:

"Give me some of that line.A piece of rope was handed to him, and Black Tom stepped into the boat
to aid him.Between them, they succeeded in making Frank fast, for the
boy's struggles were weak, at best."At Fardale Frank
Merriwell triumphed.He disgraced me, and I was forced to fly from the
school.""You disgraced yourself," declared the defiant captive."You cheated at
cards--you fleeced your schoolmates."Oh, yes, I was rather flip with the papers,
and I should not have been detected but for you, Merriwell.When I was
exposed, I knew I would be shunned by all the fellows in school, and so
I ran away.But I did not forget who brought the disgrace about, and I
knew we should meet some time, Merriwell.How you came here
I do not know, and why my bullet did not kill you is more than I can
understand.""It would have killed me but for a locket and picture in my pocket,"
returned Frank."It struck the locket, and that saved me; but the shock
robbed me of strength--it must have robbed me of consciousness for a
moment.""It would have been just as well for you if the locket had not stopped
the bullet," declared Gage, fiercely."By that I presume you mean that you intend to murder me anyway?""I have sworn that one of us shall never leave this swamp alive.""Go ahead, Gage," came coolly from the lips of the captive."Luck seems
to have turned your way.Make the most of it while you have an
opportunity.""We can't spend time in gabbing here," came nervously from Bowsprit."Yes," put in Black Tom; "fo' de Lawd's sake, le's get away before dat
light shine some mo'!""That's right," said the old tar."Some things happen in this swamp that
no human being can account for."Gage was ready enough to get away, and they were soon pulling onward
again, with Frank Merriwell, bound and helpless, in the bottom of the
smaller boat.For nearly an hour they rowed, and then they succeeded in finding some
dry, solid land where they could camp beneath the tall, black trees.They were so overcome with alarm that they did not venture to build a
fire, for all that Gage was shivering in his wet clothes.Leslie was still puzzling over Frank Merriwell's astonishing appearance,
and he tried to question Frank concerning it, but he could obtain but
little satisfaction from the boy he hated.Away to the west stretched the Everglades, while to the north and the
east lay the dismal cypress swamps.The party seemed quite alone in the heart of the desolate region.Leslie started out to explore the strip of elevated land upon which they
had passed the night, and he found it stretched back into the woods,
where lay great stagnant pools of water and where grew all kinds of
strange plants and vines.Gage had been from the camp about thirty minutes when he came running
back, his face pale, and a fierce look in his eyes.cried Bowsprit, with an attempt at cheerfulness.What is it you have heard about, my hearty?""The serpent vine," answered Gage, wildly.I did not believe there was such a thing, but it tangled
my feet, it tried to twine about my legs, and I saw the little red
flowers opening and shutting like the lips of devils.""Fo' de Lawd's sake!de boss hab gone stark, starin' mad!"cried Black
Tom, staring at Leslie with bulging eyes."But I have thought of a way to
dispose of Frank Merriwell.Frank had listened to all this, and he noted that Gage actually seemed
like a maniac.Captain Bellwood, securely bound, was near Frank, to whom he now spoke:

"God pity you, my lad!He was bad enough before, but he seems to have
gone mad."Well, if that's to be the end of me, I'll have to take my medicine,"
came grimly from the lips of the undaunted boy captive.She is with friends of mine, and they will
fight for her as long as they are able to draw a breath."Now I care not if these wretches murder me!""I scarcely think they will murder you, captain.They have nothing in
particular against you; but Gage hates me most bitterly."snarled Leslie, who had overheard Frank's last words."I do hate you, and my hatred seems to have increased tenfold since last
night.I have been thinking--thinking how you have baffled me at every
turn whenever we have come together.I have decided that you are my evil
genius, and that I shall never have any luck as long as you live.One of us will not leave this swamp alive, and you
will be that one!""Go ahead with the funeral," said Frank, stoutly."If you have made up
your mind to murder me, I can't help myself; but one thing is
sure--you'll not hear me beg.""Wait till you know what your fate is to be.Boys, set his feet free,
and then follow me, with him between you."The cords which held Frank's feet were released, and he was lifted to a
standing position.Then he was marched along after Gage, who led the
way.Into the woods he was marched, and finally Gage came to a halt,
motioning for the others to stop.he cried, pointing; "there is the serpent vine!"On the ground before them, lay a mass of greenish vines, blossoming over
with a dark red flower.Harmless enough they looked, but, as Gage drew a
little nearer, they suddenly seemed to come to life, and they began
reaching toward his feet, twisting, squirming, undulating like a mass of
serpents.shouted Leslie--"there is the vine that feeds on flesh and
blood!See--see how it reached for my feet!It longs to grasp me, to
draw me into its folds, to twine about my body, my neck, to strangle
me!"The sailors shuddered and drew back, while Frank Merriwell's face was
very pale."It did fasten upon me," Gage continued."If I had not been ready and
quick with my knife, it would have drawn me into its deadly embrace.I
managed to cut myself free and escape."Then he turned to Frank, and the dancing light in his eyes was not a
light of sanity."Merriwell," he said, "the serpent vine will end your life, and you'll
never bother me any more!"He leaped forward and clutched the helpless captive, screaming:

"Thus I keep my promise!"And he flung Frank headlong into the clutch of the writhing vine!With his hands bound behind his back, unable to help himself, Frank
reeled forward into the embrace of the deadly vine, each branch of which
was twisting, curling, squirming like the arms of an octopus.He nearly plunged forward upon his face, but managed to recover and keep
on his feet.He felt the vine whip about his legs and fasten there tenaciously, felt
it twist and twine and crawl like a mass of serpents, and he knew he was
in the grasp of the frightful plant which till that hour he had ever
believed a creation of some romancer's feverish fancy.A great horror seemed to come upon him and benumb
his body and his senses.He could feel the horrid vines climbing and coiling about him, and he
was helpless to struggle and tear them away.He knew they were mounting
to his neck, where they would curl about his throat and choke the breath
of life from his body.It was a fearful fate--a terrible death.And there seemed no possible
way of escaping.Higher and higher climbed the vine, swaying and squirming, the blood-red
flowers opening and closing like lips of a vampire that thirsted for his
blood.A look of horror was frozen on Frank's face.His eyes bulged from his
head, and his lips were drawn back from his teeth.He did not cry out,
he did not seem to breathe, but he appeared to be turned to stone in the
grasp of the deadly plant.It was a dreadful sight, and the two sailors, rough and wicked men
though they were, were overcome by the spectacle.Shuddering and
gasping, they turned away.For the first time, Gage seemed to fully realize what he had done.He
covered his eyes with his hand and staggered backward, uttering a low,
groaning sound.Merriwell's staring eyes seemed fastened straight upon him with that
fearful stare, and the thought flashed through the mind of the wretched
boy that he should never forget those eyes."They will haunt me as long as I live!"Already he was seized by the pangs of remorse.Once more he looked at Frank, and once more those staring eyes turned
his blood to ice water.Then, uttering shriek after shriek, Gage turned and fled through the
swamp, plunging through marshy places and jungles, falling, scrambling
up, leaping, staggering, gasping for breath, feeling those staring eyes
at his back, feeling that they would pursue him to his doom.Scarcely less agitated and overcome, Bowsprit and the <DW64> followed,
and Frank Merriwell was abandoned to his fate.Frank longed for the use of his hands to tear away those fiendish vines.It was a horrible thing to stand and let them creep up, up, up, till
they encircled his throat and strangled him to death.Through his mind flashed a picture of himself as he would stand there
with the vines drawing tighter and tighter about his throat and his face
growing blacker and blacker, his tongue hanging out, his eyes starting
from their sockets.He came near shrieking for help, but the thought that the cry must reach
the ears of Leslie Gage kept it back, enabled him to choke it down.He had declared that Gage should not hear him beg for mercy or aid.Not
even the serpent vine and all its horrors could make him forget that
vow.The little red flowers were getting nearer and nearer to his face, and
they were fluttering with eagerness.He felt a sucking, drawing,
stinging sensation on one of his wrists, and he believed one of those
fiendish vampire mouths had fastened there.He swayed his body, he tried to move his feet, but he seemed rooted to
the ground.He did not have the strength to drag himself from that fatal
spot and from the grasp of the vine.His senses were in a maze, and the whole
world was reeling and romping around him.The trees became a band of
giant demons, winking, blinking, grinning at him, flourishing their arms
in the air, and dancing gleefully on every side to the sound of wild
music that came from far away in the sky.Then a smaller demon darted out from amid the trees, rushed at him,
clutched him, slashed, slashed, slashed on every side of him, dragged at
his collar, and panted in his ear:

"White boy fight--try to git away!Was it a dream--was it an hallucination?He
tore at the clinging vines, he fought with all his remaining strength,
he struggled to get away from those clinging things.All the while that other figure was slashing and cutting with something
bright, while the vine writhed and hissed like serpents in agony.How it was accomplished Frank could never tell, but he felt himself
dragged free of the serpent vine, dragged beyond its deadly touch, and
he knew it was no dream that he was free!A black mist hung before his eyes, but he looked through it and faintly
murmured:

"Socato, you have saved me!""Yes, white boy," replied the voice of the Seminole, "I found you just
in time.A few moments more and you be a dead one.""That is true, Socato--that is true!I can never
pay you for what you have done!"In truth the Indian had appeared barely in time to rescue Frank from the
vine, and it had been a desperate and exhausting battle.In another
minute the vine would have accomplished its work."I hear white boy cry out, and I see him run from this way," explained
the Seminole.Sailor men follow, and then I
come to see what scare them so.You knew how to fight the vine--how to cut
it with your knife, and so you saved me.""We must git 'way from here soon as can," declared the Indian."Bad
white men may not come back, and they may come back.They may want to
see what has happen to white boy."Frank knew this was true, but for some time he was not able to get upon
his feet and walk.At length the Indian assisted him, and, leaning on
Socato's shoulder, he made his way along.Avoiding the place where the sailors were camped, the Seminole proceeded
directly to the spot where his canoe was hidden.Frank got in, and
Socato took the paddle, sending the light craft skimming over the water.Straight to the strange hut where Frank and his companions had stopped
the previous night they made their way.The sun was shining into the heart of the great Dismal Swamp, and Elsie
Bellwood was at the door to greet Frank Merriwell.Elsie held out both hands, and there was a welcome light in her eyes.It
seemed to Frank that she was far prettier than when he had last seen her
in Fardale."Frank, I am so glad to see you!"He caught her hands and held them, looking into her eyes.The color came
into her cheeks, and then she noted his rumpled appearance, saw that he
was very pale, and cried:

"What is it, Frank?Socato grunted in a knowing way, but said nothing."It is nothing, Miss Bellwood," assured the boy."I have been through a
little adventure, that's all.He felt her fingers trembling in his clasp, and an electric thrill ran
over him.He remembered that at their last parting she had said it were
far better they should never meet again; but fate had thrown them
together, and now--what?He longed to draw her to him, to kiss her, to tell her how happy he was
at finding her, but he restrained the impulse.Then the voice of Barney Mulloy called from within the hut:

"Phwat ye goin' to do me b'y--shtand out there th' rist av th' doay?Whoy don't yez come in, Oi dunno?""Come in, Frank--come in," cried Professor Scotch."We have been worried
to death over you.Thought you were lost in the Everglades, or had
fallen into the hands of the enemy.""Your second thought was correct," smiled Frank, as he entered the hut,
with Elsie at his side.shouted the Irish boy, in astonishment."Ye don't mane
to say thim spalpanes caught yez?""That's what they did, and they came near cooking me, too."Frank then related the adventures that had befallen him since he started
out on his own hook to give Leslie Gage a surprise.He told how Gage had
made love to him in the boat, and Barney shrieked with laughter.Then he
related what followed, and how his life had been saved by the locket he
carried, and the professor groaned with dismay.Following this, he
related his capture by Gage and how the young desperado flung him, with
his hands bound, into the clutch of the serpent vine.The narrative first amused and then thrilled his listeners.Finally they
were horrified and appalled by the peril through which he had passed."It's Satan's own scum thot Gage is!""Iver let
me get a crack at th' loike av him and see phwat will happen to th'
whilp!"Then Frank explained how he had been saved by Socato, and the Seminole
found himself the hero of the hour."Soc, ould b'y," cried Barney, "thot wur th' bist job ye iver did, an'
Oi'm proud av yez!Ye'll niver lose anything by thot thrick, ayther."roared the little professor, wiping his eyes.Then the Seminole had his hand shaken in a manner and with a heartiness
that astonished him greatly."That was nothing," he declared, "Socato hates the snake vine--fight it
any time.When all had been told and the party had recovered from the excitement
into which they had been thrown, Barney announced that breakfast was
waiting.Elsie, for all of her happiness at meeting Frank, was so troubled about
her father that she could eat very little.Socato ate hastily, and then announced that he would go out and see what
he could do about rescuing Captain Bellwood.Barney wished to go with the Seminole, but Socato declared that he could
do much better alone, and hurriedly departed.Then Frank did his best to cheer Elsie, telling her that everything was
sure to come out all right, as the Indian could be trusted to outwit the
desperadoes and rescue the captain.Seeing Frank and Elsie much together, Barney drew the professor aside,
and whispered:

"It's a bit av a walk we'd better take in th' open air, Oi think.""But I don't need a walk," protested the little man."Yis ye do, profissor," declared the Irish boy, soberly."A man av your
studious habits nivver takes ixercoise enough.""But I do not care to expose myself outdoors.""Phwat's th' matther wid out dures, Oi dunno?""There's danger that Gage and his gang will appear."We can get back here aheed av thim, fer we won't go
fur enough to be cut off.""Then the exercise will not be beneficial, and I will remain here.""Profissor, yer head is a bit thick.Can't ye take a hint, ur is it a
kick ye nade, Oi dunno?""Young man, be careful what kind of language you use to me!""Oi'm spakin' United States, profissor; no Irishmon wauld iver spake
English av he could hilp it.""But such talk of thick heads and kicks--to me, sir, to me!""Well, Oi don't want to give yez a kick, but ye nade it.Ye can't see
thot it's alone a bit Frank an' th' litthle girrul would loike to be."did ye iver think ye'd loike to be alone wid a pretty swate
girrul, profissor?Come on, now, before Oi pick ye up an' lug ye out."So Barney finally induced the professor to leave the hut, but the little
man remained close at hand, ready to bolt in through the wide open door
the instant there was the least sign of danger.Left to themselves, Frank and Elsie chatted, talking over many things of
mutual interest.They sat very near together, and more and more Frank
felt the magnetism of the girl's winning ways and tender eyes.He drew
nearer and nearer, and, finally, although neither knew how it happened,
their hands met, their fingers interlocked, and then he was saying
swiftly, earnestly:

"Elsie, you cannot know how often I have thought of you since you left
me at Fardale.There was something wrong about that parting, Elsie, for
you refused to let me know where you were going, refused to write to me,
expressed a wish that we might never meet again."Her head was bowed, and her cheeks were very
pale."All the while," she softly said, "away down in my heart was a hope I
could not kill--a hope that we might meet again some day, Frank.""When we have to part again,
Elsie, you will not leave me as you did before?She was looking straight into his eyes now, her face was near his, and
the temptation was too great for his impulsive nature to resist.In a
moment his arm was about her neck, and he had kissed her.She quickly released herself from his hold and sprang to her feet, the
warm blood flushing her cheeks."We cannot always be right," she admitted; "but we should be right when
we can.Frank, Inza Burrage befriended me.She thinks more of you than
any one else in the wide world.He lifted his hand to a round hole in his coat where a bullet from
Leslie Gage's revolver had cut through, and beneath it he felt the
ruined and shattered locket that held Inza's picture.The forenoon passed, and the afternoon was well advanced, but still
Socato the Seminole did not return.But late in the afternoon a boat and a number of canoes appeared.In the
boat was Leslie Gage and the two sailors, Black Tom and Bowsprit."Phwat th'
dickens does this mane, Oi dunno?""It means trouble," said Frank, quickly."Have the rifles ready, and be
prepared for hot work.""Those must be Seminoles," said Frank."It is scarcely likely that they
are very dangerous."The boat containing the three white persons ran boldly up to the shore,
and Leslie Gage landed.Advancing a short distance toward the hut, the
door of which was securely closed, he cried:

"Hello in there!""Talk with him, Barney," Frank swiftly directed."The fellow does not
know I am alive, and I do not wish him to know it just now."So Barney returned:

"Hello, yersilf, an' see how ye loike it.""You people are in a bad trap," declared Gage, with a threatening air."Look," and he motioned toward the water, where the canoes containing
the Indians were lying, "these are my backers.There are twenty of them,
and I have but to say the word to have them attack this hut and tear it
to the ground.""Well, Oi dunno about thot," coolly retorted the Irish lad."We moight
have something to say in thot case.It's arrumed we are, an' we know how
to use our goons, me foine birrud.""If you were to fire a shot at one of these Indians it would mean the
death of you all."Well, we are arrumed with Winchester repeaters, an' it
moight make the death av thim all av we began shootin'.""They do not look very dangerous," said Frank."I'll wager something
Gage has hired the fellows to come here and make a show in order to
scare us into submitting.The chances are the Indians will not fight at
all.""You're not fools," said Gage, "and you will not do anything that means
the same as signing your death warrant.If you will come to reason,
we'll have no trouble.We want that girl, Miss Bellwood, and we will
have her.If you do not----"

He stopped suddenly, for there was a great shouting from the Indians.they cried, in tones that betokened the
greatest terror.Then they took to flight, paddling as if their very lives depended on
it.At the same time, the mysterious white canoe, still apparently without
an occupant, was seen coming swiftly toward them, gliding lightly over
the water in a most unaccountable manner.Exclamations of astonishment broke from the two sailors, and Leslie Gage
stared at the singular craft in profound astonishment.When the attention of the crowd was on the remarkable sight, Frank
unfastened the door and before Gage was aware of it, our hero was right
upon him.Frank shouted, pointing a revolver at the
fellow.Gage saw the boy he believed he had destroyed, uttered a wild shriek,
threw up his hands, and fell in a senseless heap to the ground.Frank swiftly lifted the fellow, and then ran into the cabin with him,
placing him on the couch.In fact, they seemed almost as badly
scared as the Indians, and they got away in their boat, rowing as if for
their very lives, soon passing from sight.exclaimed Barney Mulloy; "this is phwat Oi call a
ragion av wonders.It's ivery doay and almost ivery hour something
happens to astonish ye."Gage was made secure, so he could not get away when he recovered from
the swoon into which he seemed to have fallen.A short time after, Socato was seen returning, but he was alone in his
canoe."He has not found my father--my poor father!""Let's hear what he has to say."The bad white men leave their captive alone," said Socato, "and I
should have set him free, but the great white phantom came, and then the
white captive disappeared."Whom do you mean by the great white phantom?""The one who owns the canoe that goes alone--the one who built this
house and lives here sometimes.My people say he is
a phantom, for he can appear and disappear as he likes, and he commands
the powers of light and darkness.Socato knew that the bad white man had
hired a hunting party of my people to come here and appear before the
house to frighten you, but he knew you would not be frightened, and the
bad men could not get my people to aid them in a fight.Socato also knew
that the great white phantom sent his canoe to scare my people away, but
he does not know what the great white phantom has done with the man who
was a prisoner.""Well, it is possible the great white phantom will explain a few things
we do not understand," said Frank, "for here he comes in his canoe.""And father--my father is with him in the canoe!"screamed Elsie
Bellwood, in delight.The white canoe was approaching, still gliding noiselessly
over the water, without any apparent power of propulsion, and in it were
seated two men.One had a long white beard and a profusion of white
hair.He was dressed entirely in white, and sat in the stern of the
canoe.The other was Captain Justin Bellwood, quite unharmed, and
looking very much at his ease.The little party flocked to the shore to greet the captain, who waved
his hand and called reassuringly to Elsie.As soon as the canoe touched
and came to a rest, he stepped out and clasped his daughter in his arms,
saying, fervently:

"Heaven be thanked!we have come through many dangers, and we are free
at last!Neither of us has been harmed, and we will soon be out of this
fearful swamp."The man with the white hair and beard stepped ashore and stood regarding
the girl intently, paying no heed to the others.Captain Bellwood turned
to him, saying:

"William, this is my daughter, of whom I told you.Elsie, this is your
Uncle William, who disappeared many years ago, and has never been heard
from since till he set me free to-day, after I was abandoned by those
wretches who dragged us here.""And so I believed, but he still lives.Professor Scotch, I think we had
the pleasure of meeting in Fardale.Permit me to introduce you to
William Bellwood, one of the most celebrated electricians living
to-day."As he said this, Captain Bellwood made a swift motion which his brother
did not see.He touched his forehead, and the signal signified that
William Bellwood was not right in his mind.This the professor saw was
true when he shook hands with the man, for there was the light of
madness in the eyes of the hermit."My brother," continued Captain Bellwood, "has explained that he came
here to these wilds to continue his study of electricity alone and
undisturbed.He took means to keep other people from bothering him.This
canoe, which contains a lower compartment and a hidden propeller, driven
by electricity, was his invention.He has arrangements whereby he can
use a powerful search-light at night, and----"

"That search-light came near being the death of me," said Frank."He
turned it on me last night just in time to show me to my enemy.""He has many other contrivances," Captain Bellwood went on."He has
explained that, by means of electricity, he can make his canoe or
himself glow with a white light in the darkest night.""And he also states that he has wires connecting various batteries in
yonder hut, so that he can frighten away superstitious hunters who
otherwise might take possession of the hut and give him trouble.""Thot ixplains th' foire-allarum an' th' power
thot throwed me inther th' middle av th' flure!Oi nivver hearrud th'
bate av it!"At this moment, a series of wild shrieks came from the hut, startling
them all.Gage was still on the couch,
and he shrieked still louder when he saw Frank; an expression of the
greatest terror coming to his face.Then he began to rave incoherently, sometimes frothing at the mouth.Two days later a party of eight persons emerged from the wilds of the
great Dismal Swamp and reached a small settlement.They were Frank
Merriwell, Barney Mulloy, Professor Scotch, Leslie Gage, Captain
Bellwood and his brother William, Socato the Seminole, and last, but far
from least, Elsie Bellwood."He shall be given shelter and medical treatment," declared Frank; "and
I will see that all the bills are paid.""Thot's the only thing Oi have against ye, me b'y.Ye wur always letting
up on yer inemies at Fardale, an' ye shtill kape on doin' av it.""If I continue to do so, I shall have nothing to trouble my conscience."Frank did take care of Gage and see that he was given the best medical
aid that money could procure, and, as a result, the fellow was saved
from a madhouse, for he finally recovered.He seemed to appreciate the
mercy shown him by his enemy, for he wrote a letter to Frank that was
filled with entreaties for forgiveness and promised to try to lead a
different life in the future."That," said Frank, "is my reward for being merciful to an enemy."If Jack Jaggers did not perish in the Everglades, he disappeared.Ben
Bowsprit and Black Tom also vanished, and it is possible that they left
their bones in the great Dismal Swamp.William Bellwood, so long a hermit in the wilds of Florida, seemed glad
to leave that region.Leaving their friends in Florida, Frank, Barney and the professor next
moved northward toward Tennessee, Frank wishing to see some of the
battlegrounds of the Civil War.The boys planned a brief tour afoot and were soon on their way among the
Great Smoky Mountains.Professor Scotch had no heart for a "tour afoot" through the mountains,
and so he had stopped at Knoxville, where the boys were to join him
again in two or three weeks, by the end of which period he was quite
sure they would have enough of tramping.Frank and Barney were making the journey from Gibson's Gap to Cranston's
Cove, which was said to be a distance of twelve miles, but they were
willing to admit that those mountain miles were most disgustingly long.They had paused to rest, midway in the afternoon, where the road curved
around a spur of the mountain.Below them opened a vista of valleys and
"coves," hemmed in by wild, turbulent-appearing masses of mountains,
some of which were barren and bleak, seamed with black chasms, above
which threateningly hung grimly beetling crags, and some of which were
robed in dense wildernesses of pine, veiling their faces, keeping them
thus forever a changeless mystery.From their eyrie position it seemed that they could toss a pebble into
Lost Creek, which wound through the valley below, meandered for miles
amid the ranges, tunneling an unknown channel beneath the rock-ribbed
mountains, and came out again--where?Both boys had been silent and awe-stricken, gazing wonderingly on the
impressive scene and thinking of their adventures in New Orleans and in
Florida, when a faint cry seemed to float upward from the depths of the
valley.They listened, and some moments passed in silence, save for the peeping
cry of a bird in a thicket near at hand.Oi belave it wur imagination, Frankie," said the Irish lad, at
last."I do not think so," declared Frank, with a shake of his head."It was a
human voice, and if we were to shout it might be---- There it is again!"There could be no doubt this time, for they both heard the cry
distinctly."It comes from below," said Frank, quickly."Roight, me lad," nodded Barney."Some wan is in difficulty down there,
and' it's mesilf thot don't moind givin' thim a lift."Getting a firm hold on a scrub bush, Frank leaned out over the verge and
looked down into the valley."Look, Barney--look down there amid those
rocks just below the little waterfall.""She has seen us, and is signaling for us to come down.""Instanter, as they say out West."The boys were soon hurrying down the mountain road, a bend of which
quickly carried them beyond view of the person near the waterfall.It was nearly an hour later when Frank and Barney approached the little
waterfall, having left the road and followed the course of the stream.anxiously asked Barney, who was behind."Can't tell yet," was the reply."Will be able to see in a minute, and
then---- She is there, sure as fate!"In another moment they came out in full view of a girl of eighteen or
nineteen, who was standing facing the waterfall, her back toward a great
rock, a home-made fishing pole at her feet.The girl was dressed in homespun, the skirt being short and reaching
but a little below the knees, and a calico sunbonnet was thrust half off
her head.Frank paused, with a low exclamation of admiration, for the girl made a
most strikingly beautiful picture, and Frank had an eye for beauty.Nearly all the mountain girls the boys had seen were stolid and
flat-appearing, some were tall and lank, but this girl possessed a
figure that seemed perfect in every detail.Her hair was bright auburn, brilliant and rich in tint, the shade that
is highly esteemed in civilization, but is considered a defect by the
mountain folk.Frank thought it the most beautiful hair he had ever
seen.Her eyes were brown and luminous, and the color of health showed through
the tan upon her cheeks.Her parted lips showed white, even teeth, and
the mouth was most delicately shaped.gasped Barney, at Frank's shoulder."Phwat have we struck, Oi
dunno?"Then the girl cried, her voice full of impatience:

"You-uns has shorely been long enough in gittin' har!"Frank staggered a bit, for he had scarcely expected to hear the uncouth
mountain dialect from such lips as those but he quickly recovered,
lifted his hat with the greatest gallantry, and said:

"I assure you, miss, that we came as swiftly as we could."Ef you-uns had been maounting boys, you'd been har in
less'n half ther time.""I presume that is true; but, you see, we did not know the shortest way,
and we were not sure you wanted us.""Wal, what did you 'low I whooped at ye fur ef I didn't want ye?I
nighly split my throat a-hollerin' at ye before ye h'ard me at all."Frank was growing more and more dismayed, for he had never before met a
strange girl who was quite like this, and he knew not what to say."Now that we have arrived," he bowed, "we shall be happy to be of any
possible service to you.""Dunno ez I want ye now," she returned, with a toss of her head.gurgled Barney, at Frank's ear."It's a doaisy she is,
me b'y!"Frank resolved to take another tack, and so he advanced, saying boldly
and resolutely:

"Now that you have called us down here, I don't see how you are going to
get rid of us.You want something of us, and we'll not leave you till we
find out what it is."The girl did not appear in the least alarmed.Instead of that, she
laughed, and that laugh was like the ripple of falling water."Wal, now you're talkin'!"she cried, with something like a flash of
admiration."Mebbe you-uns has got some backbone arter all."I have not looked at mine for so long that I am not sure what condition
it is in, but I know I have one.""Then move this rock har that hez caught my foot an' holds it.That's
what I wanted o' you-uns."She lifted her skirt a bit, and, for the first time, they saw that her
ankle had been caught between two large rocks, where she was held fast."Kinder slomped in thar when I war fishin'," she explained, "an' ther
big rock dropped over thar an' cotched me fast when I tried ter pull
out.That war nigh two hour ago, 'cordin' ter ther sun.""And you have been standing like that ever since?"cried Frank, in
dismay."Lively, Barney--get hold here!we must have her
out of that in a hurry!""Thot's phwat we will, ur we'll turrun th' ould mountain over!"shouted
the Irish lad, as he flew to the aid of his friend.The girl looked surprised and pleased, and then she said:

"You-uns ain't goin' ter move that rock so easy, fer it's hefty.""But your ankle--it must have crushed your ankle."Ye see it couldn't pinch harder ef it tried, fer them rocks
ain't built so they kin git nigher together; but it's jest made a
reg'ler trap so I can't pull my foot out."It was no easy thing for the boys to get hold of the rock in a way to
exert their strength, but they finally succeeded, and then Frank gave
the word, and they strained to move it.It started reluctantly, as if
loath to give up its fair captive, but they moved it more and more, and
she was able to draw her foot out.Then, when she was free, they let go,
and the rock fell back with a grating crash against the other."You-uns have done purty fair fer boys," said the girl, with a saucy
twinkle in her brown eyes."S'pose I'll have ter thank ye, fer I mought
a stood har consider'bul longer ef 'tadn't bin fer ye.an' whar be ye goin'?"Frank introduced himself, and then presented Barney, after which he
explained how they happened to be in the Great Smoky Mountains.She watched him closely as he spoke, noting every expression, as if a
sudden suspicion had come upon her, and she was trying to settle a doubt
in her mind.When Frank had finished, the girl said:

"Never heard o' two boys from ther big cities 'way off yander comin' har
ter tromp through ther maountings jest fer ther fun o' seein' ther
scenery an' ther folks.I s'pose we're kinder curi's 'pearin' critters
ter city folks, an' you-uns may be har ter cotch one o' us an' put us in
a cage fer exhibition."She uttered the words in a way that brought a flush to Frank's cheeks,
and he hastened to protest, halting in confusion when he tried to speak
her name, which he did not know as yet.A ripple of sunshine seemed to break over her face, and she laughed
outright, swiftly saying:

"Don't you-uns mind me.I'm p'izen rough, but I don't mean half I say.I
kin see you is honest an' squar, though somebody else mought think by
yer way that ye warn't.My name's Kate Kenyon, an' I live down toward
ther cove.I don't feel like fishin' arter this, an' ef you-uns is goin'
that way, I'll go 'long with ye."She picked up her pole, hooked up the line, and prepared to accompany
them.They were pleased to have her as a companion.Indeed, Frank was more
than pleased, for he saw in this girl a singular character.Illiterate
though she seemed, she was pretty, vivacious, and so bright that it was
plain education and refinement would make her most fascinating and
brilliant.The boys did not get to Cranston's Cove that night, for Kate Kenyon
invited them to stop and take supper at her home, and they did so.Kate's home was much like the rough cabins of other mountain folks,
except that flowering vines had been trained to run up the sides and
over the door, while two large bushes were loaded with roses in front of
the house.Kate's mother was in the doorway as they approached.She was a tall,
angular woman, with a stolid, expressionless face."Har, mammy, is some fellers I brung ter see ye," said this girl.Merriwell, an' that un is Mr.The boys lifted their hats, and bowed to the woman as if she were a
society queen."What be you-uns doin' 'round these parts?"Frank explained, seeing a look of suspicion and distrust deepening in
her face as he spoke."An' what do you-uns want o'
me?""Your daughter invited us to call and take supper," said Frank, coolly."I ain't uster cookin' flip-flaps fer city chaps, an' I don't b'lieve
you kin eat the kind o' fodder we-uns is uster."The boys hastened to assure her that they would be delighted to eat the
plainest of food, and their eagerness brought a merry laugh from the
lips of the girl."You-uns is consid'ble amusin'," she said.I
asked 'em to come, mammy.It's no more'n fair pay fer what they done fer
me."Then she explained how she had been caught and held by the rocks, and
how the boys had seen her from the mountain road and come to her
rescue.The mother's face did not soften a bit as she listened, but, when Kate
had finished, she said:

"They're yore comp'ny.So the boys were asked into the cabin, and Kate herself prepared supper.It was a plain meal, but Frank noticed that everything looked neat and
clean about the house, and both lads relished the coarse food.Indeed,
Barney afterward declared that the corn bread was better than the finest
cake he had ever tasted.Frank was particularly happy at the table, and the merry stories he told
kept Kate laughing, and, once or twice, brought a grim smile to the face
of the woman.After supper they went out in front of the cabin, where they could look
up at the wild mass of mountains, the peaks of which were illumined by
the rays of the setting sun.Kenyon filled and lighted a cob pipe.She sat and puffed away,
staring straight ahead in a blank manner.Just how it happened Frank himself could not have told, but Barney fell
to talking to the woman in his whimsical way, while Frank and Kate
wandered away a short distance, and sat on some stones which had been
arranged as a bench in a little nook near Lost Creek.From this position
they could hear Barney's rich brogue and jolly laugh as he recounted
some amusing yarn, and, when the wind was right, a smell of the black
pipe would be wafted to them."Do you know," said Frank, "this spot is so wild and picturesque that it
fascinates me.I should like to stop here two or three days and rest.""Better not," said the girl, shortly."Wal, it mought not be healthy.""I wonder ef you air so ignerent, or be you jest makin' it?""Honestly and truly, I do not understand you.""Wal, I kinder 'low you-uns is all right, but thar's others might not
think so.S'pose you know what moonshine is?""Yes; it is illicitly distilled whiskey."Wal, ther revenues say thar's moonshine made round these
parts.They come round ev'ry little while to spy an' cotch ther folks
that makes it.""By revenues you mean the officers of the government?""Wal, they may be officers, but they're a difrrunt kind than Jock
Hawkins.""He's ther sheriff down to ther cove.Jock Hawkins knows better'n to
come snoopin' 'round, an' he's down on revenues ther same as ther rest
o' us is.""Then you do not like the revenue officers?"cried the girl, starting up, her eyes seeming to blaze in
the dusky twilight."I hate 'em wuss'n pizen!An' I've got good cause
fer hatin' 'em."The boy saw he had touched a tender spot, and he would have turned the
conversation in another channel, but she was started, and she went on
swiftly:

"What right has ther gover'ment to take away anybody's honest means o'
earnin' a livin'?What right has ther gover'ment to send spies up har
ter peek an' pry an' report on a man as is makin' a little moonshine ter
sell that he may be able ter git bread an' drink fer his fam'ly?What
right has ther gover'ment ter make outlaws an' crim'nals o' men as
wouldn't steal a cent that didn't b'long ter them if they was starvin'?"Frank knew well enough the feeling of most mountain folks toward the
revenue officers, and he knew it was a useless task to attempt to show
them where they were in the wrong."Yes, I has good right to hate ther revenues, an' I do!Didn't they
pester my pore old daddy fer makin' moonshine!Didn't they hunt him
through ther maountings fer weeks, an' keep him hidin' like a dog!An'
didn't they git him cornered at last in Bent Coin's old cabin, an' when
he refused ter come out an' surrender, an' kep' 'em off with his gun,
didn't they shoot him so he died three days arter in my arms!Wal, I've got good reason ter hate 'em!"Kate was wildly excited, although she held her voice down, as if she did
not wish her mother to hear what she was saying.Frank was sitting so
near that he felt her arm quivering against his."I has more than that to hate 'em fer!Whar is my brother Rufe, ther best boy that ever drored a breath?Ther
revenues come fer him, an' they got him.Thar war a trial, an' they
proved ez he'd been consarned in makin' moonshine.He war convicted, an'
he's servin' his time.Wal, thar's nuthin' I hate wuss on this
earth!""You have had hard luck," said Frank, by way of saying something."It's
lucky for us that we're not revenues.""Yer right thar," she nodded."I didn't know but ye war at first, but I
changed my mind later.""Wal, ye're young, an' you-uns both has honest faces."I don't suppose they have been able to check the making of
moonshine--that is, not to any extent?""He makes more whiskey in a week than all ther others in this region
afore him made in a month.""He must be smarter than the others before him.""Wal, he's not afeared o' ther revenues, an' he's a mystery to ther men
ez works fer him right along.""None o' them has seen his face, an' they don't know Who he is.They
ain't been able to find out.""Wal, Con Bean war shot through ther shoulder fer follerin' Muriel, an'
Bink Mower got it in ther leg fer ther same trick.""I rather admire this Muriel," laughed Frank."He may be in unlawful
business, but he seems to be a dandy.""He keeps five stills runnin' all ther time, an' he has a way o' gittin'
ther stuff out o' ther maountings an' disposin' of it.But I'm talkin'
too much, as Wade would say.""He's Wade Miller, a partic'lar friend o' our'n sence Rufe war tooken by
ther revenues.Wade has been good to mammy an' me."If I lived near, I might try to bother Wade
somewhat."It was now duskish, but he was so near that
he could see her eyes through the twilight."I dunno what you-uns means," she said, slowly, her voice falling."Wade
would be powerful bad to bother.He's ugly sometimes, an' he's jellus o'
me.""Wal, he's tryin' ter, but I don't jes' snuggle ter him ther way I might
ef I liked him right.Thar's something about him, ez I don't edzac'ly
like.""That makes it rather one-sided, and makes me think all the more that I
should try to bother him if I lived near.Do you know, Miss Kenyon, that
you are an exceptionally pretty girl?""Hair that would make you the envy of a society belle.It is the
handsomest hair I ever saw.""Now you're makin' fun o' me, an' I don't like that."She drew away as if offended, and he leaned toward her, eager to
convince her of his sincerity."Indeed, I am doing nothing of the sort," he protested."The moment I
saw you to-day I was struck by the beauty of your hair.But that is not
the only beautiful feature about you, Miss Kenyon.Your mouth is a
perfect Cupid's bow, and your teeth are like pearls, while you have a
figure that is graceful and exquisite.""Never nobody talked to me like that afore," she murmured."Round har
they jes' say, 'Kate, you'd be a rippin' good looker ef it warn't fer
that red hair o' yourn.'An' they've said it so much that I've come to
hate my hair wuss'n pizen."Her hand found his, and they were sitting very near together."I took to you up by ther fall ter-day," she went on, in a low tone."Now, don't you git skeered, fer I'm not goin' to be foolish, an' I know
I'm not book-learned an' refined, same ez your city gals.We kin be
friends, can't we?"Frank had begun to regret his openly expressed admiration, but now he
said:

"To be sure we can be friends, Miss Kenyon.""I am sure I shall esteem your friendship very highly.""Wall, partic'ler friends don't call each other miss an' mister.I'll
agree ter call you Frank, ef you'll call me Kate.""I am going away to-morrow," he thought.A fierce exclamation close at hand, the cracking of a twig, a heavy
step, and then a panther-like figure leaped out of the dusk, and flung
itself upon Frank.[Illustration: "Kate grasped the assailant by the collar, and with
astonishing strength, pulled him off the prostrate lad."(See page
218)]




CHAPTER XL.The attack was so sudden and fierce that the boy was hurled to the
ground before he could make a move to protect himself.A hand fastened on his throat, pinning him fast.The man's knee crushed
into his stomach, depriving him of breath.The man's other hand snatched
out something, and lifted it aloft.A knife was poised above Frank's heart, and in another moment the blade
would have been buried to the hilt in the lad's bosom.Without uttering a sound, Kate Kenyon grasped the wrist of the
murderous-minded man, gave it a wrench with all her strength, which was
not slight, and forced him to drop the knife."You don't murder anybody, Wade Miller!""I'll choke ther life outen him!"snarled the fellow, as he tried to
fasten both hands on Frank's throat.By this time the boy had recovered from the surprise and shock, and he
was ready to fight for his life.Kate grasped the assailant by the collar, and, with astonishing
strength, pulled him off the prostrate lad.In the twinkling of an eye, Frank came to his feet, and he was ready for
a new assault.Snarling and growling like a mad dog, the man scrambled up and lunged
toward the boy, trying to grasp him.Frank was a skillful boxer, and now his skill came into play, for he
dodged under the man's right arm, whirled like a cat, and struck the
fellow behind the ear.sounded the blow, sending the assailant staggering, and Frank
followed it up by leaping after him and striking him again, the second
blow having the force of the lad's strength and the weight of his body.It seemed that the man was literally knocked "spinning," and he did not
stop till he landed in the creek."Wal," exclaimed the girl, "I 'low you kin take keer o' yerself now!""I rather think so," came coolly from the boy."He caught me foul, and I
did not have a show at first."It was a case of jealousy, and he had aroused the worst
passions of the man who admired Kate Kenyon.Miller came scrambling and
snorting from the water, and Barney Mulloy rushed toward the spot,
crying:

"Pwhat's th' row, Frankie, me b'y?Do ye nade inny av me hilp?"So far, I am all right, thanks to Miss Kenyon."breathed the mountain maid, in sincere admiration."I didn't s'pose city chaps knowed how ter fight.""Some do," laughed Frank, keeping his eyes on Miller.panted the man, springing toward Frank, and then
halting suddenly, and throwing up his hand.Frank knew this well enough, and he was expecting just such a move, so
it happened that the words had scarcely left the girl's lips when the
revolver was sent flying from Wade Miller's hand.The boy had leaped forward, and, with one skillful kick, disarmed his
foe by knocking the weapon out of his hand.Miller seemed dazed for a moment, and then he started for Frank, once
more grinding his teeth."Oh, let me take a hand in this!"cried Barney Mulloy, who was eager for
a fight."Me blud is gittin' shtagnant.""Well, you have tried that trick twice, but I do not see that you have
succeeded to any great extent.""I'll hammer yer life out o' yer carcass with my bare hands!""Possibly that will not be such a very easy trick to do."The boy's coolness seemed to add to the fury of his assailant, and the
man made another rush, which was easily avoided by Frank, who struck
Miller a stinging blow."You'd better stop, Wade," advised the girl."He-uns is too much fer
you-uns, an' that's plain enough.""Oh, I'll show ye--I'll show ye!"There was no longer any reason in the man's head, and Frank saw that he
must subdue the fellow some way.Miller was determined to grapple with
the boy, and Frank felt that he would find the mountaineer had the
strength of an ox, for which reason he must keep clear of those grasping
hands.For some moments Frank had all he could do to avoid Miller, who seemed
to have grown stolid to the lad's blows.At last, Frank darted in,
caught the man behind, lifted him over one hip, and dashed him headlong
to the ground."Wal, that's the beatenest I ever saw!"cried Kate Kenyon, whose
admiration for Frank now knew no bounds."You-uns is jes' a terror!""Whoy, thot's fun fer Frankie," he declared.Miller groaned, and sat up, lifting his hands to his head, and looking
about him in a dazed way."Ye run ag'in' a fighter this time, Wade," said the girl."He done ye,
an' you-uns is ther bully o' these parts!""It was an accident," mumbled the man."I couldn't see ther critter
well, an' so he kinder got----"

"That won't go, Wade," half laughed the girl."He done you fa'r an'
squar', an' it's no us' ter squawk.""An' ye're laffin' 'bout it, be ye, Kate?"Better let him erlone, Wade.You-uns has made fool enough o' yerself.Ye tried ter kill me, an'----"

"What I saw made me do it!""He war makin' love ter ye,
Kate--an' you-uns liked it!""Wal, Wade Miller, what is that ter you-uns?""He has a right ter make love ter me ef he wants ter.""Oh, yes, he has a right, but his throat'll be slit before long, mark
what I say!""Ef anything o' that kind happens, Wade Miller, I'll know who done it,
an' I swa'r I'll never rest till I prove it agin' ye.""I don't keer, Kate," muttered the man, getting on his feet and standing
there sulkily before them."Ef I can't hev ye, I sw'ar no other critter
shall!"I've stood all I kin from you, an' from now on
I don't stan' no more.Arter this you-uns an' me-uns ain't even
friends."He fell back a step, as if he had been struck a blow, and then he
hoarsely returned:

"All right, Kate.I ain't ter be thrown
aside so easy.As fer them city chaps, ther maountings ain't big enough
ter hold them an' me.Wade Miller has some power, an' I wouldn't give a
snap for their lives.The Black Caps don't take ter strangers much, an'
they know them critters is hyar.I'm goin' now, but that don't need ter
mean that I'll stay away fer long."He turned, and, having picked up his revolver, strode away into the
darkness, quickly disappearing.Kate's trembling hand fell on Frank's arm, and she panted into his ear:

"You-uns must git out o' ther maountings quick as you kin, fer Wade
Miller means what he says, an' he'll kill ye ef you stay hyar!"Frank Merriwell's blood was aroused, and he did not feel like letting
Wade Miller drive him like a hunted dog from the mountains."By this time I should think you would have confidence in my ability to
take care of myself against this man Miller," he said, somewhat testily."Yo're ther best fighter I ever saw, but that won't'mount ter anything
agin' ther power Miller will set on yer.He's pop-ler, is Wade Miller,
an' he'll have ther hull maountings ter back him.""I shall not run for Miller and all his friends.Right is right, and I
have as good right here as he."cried Kate, admiringly; "hang me ef I don't like you-uns'
pluck.You may find that you'll need a friend afore yo're done with
Wade.Ef ye do--wal, mebbe Kate Kenyon won't be fur off.""It is a good thing to know I shall have one
friend in the mountains."Kenyon was seen stolidly standing in
the dusk."Mebbe you-uns will find my Kate ther best friend ye could
have.Come, gal, it's time ter g'win."So they entered the cabin, and Barney found an opportunity to whisper to
Frank:

"She's a corker, me b'y!an' Oi think she's shtuck on yez.Kenyon declared she was tired,
and intended to go to bed.She apologized for the bed she had to give
the boys, but they assured her that they were accustomed to sleeping
anywhere, and that the bed would be a positive luxury."Such slick-tongued chaps I never did see before," declared the old
woman."They don't seem stuck up an' lofty, like most city fellers.Really, they make me feel right to home in my own house!"She said this in a whimsical way that surprised Frank, who fancied Mrs.Kate bade them good-night, and they retired, which they were glad to do,
as they were tired from the tramp of the day.Frank was awakened by a sharp shake, and his first thought was of
danger, but his hand did not reach the revolver he had placed beneath
the pillow, for he felt something cold against his temple, and heard a
voice hiss:

"Be easy, you-uns!Ef ye make a jowl, yo're ter be shot!"Barney was awakened at the same time, and the boys found they were in
the clutches of strong men.The little room seemed filled with men, and
the lads instantly realized they were in a bad scrape.Through the small window sifted the white moonlight, showing that every
man wore a black, pointed cap and hood, which reached to his shoulders.In this hood arrangement great holes were cut for the eyes, and some had
slits cut for their mouths.was the thought that flashed through Frank's mind.The revolvers pressed against the heads of the boys kept them from
defending themselves or making an outcry.They were forced to get up and
dress, after which they were passed through the open window, like
bundles, their hands having been tied behind them.Other black-hooded men were outside, and horses were near at hand.But when he thought how tired they had been, he did not wonder that both
had slept soundly while the men slipped into the house by the window,
which had been readily and noiselessly removed.It did not take the men long to get out as they had entered.Then Frank
and Barney were placed on horses, being tied there securely, and the
party was soon ready to move.They rode away, and the horses' feet gave out no sound, which explained
why they had not aroused anybody within the cabin.The hoofs of the animals were muffled.Frank wondered what Kate Kenyon would think when morning came and she
found her guests gone."She will believe we rose in the night, and ran away.I hate to have her
believe me a coward."Then he fell to wondering what the men would do with himself and Barney.They will not dare to do anything more than
run us out of this part of the country."Although he told himself this, he was far from feeling sure that the men
would do nothing else.He had heard of the desperate deeds perpetrated
by the widely known "White Caps," and it was not likely that the Black
Caps were any less desperate and reckless.As they were leaving the vicinity of the cabin, one of the horses
neighed loudly, causing the leader of the party to utter an exclamation
of anger."Ef that 'rousts ther gal, she's li'bul ter be arter us in a hurry," one
of the men observed.The party hurried forward, soon passing from view of the cabin, and
entering the shadow that lay blackly in the depths of the valley.They rode about a mile, and then they came to a halt at a command from
the leader, and Frank noticed with alarm that they had stopped beneath a
large tree, with wide-spreading branches."This looks bad for us, old man," he whispered to Barney."Thot's pwhat it does, Frankie," admitted the Irish lad."Oi fale
throuble coming this way."The horsemen formed a circle about the captives, moving at a signal from
the leader, who did not seem inclined to waste words."Brothers o' ther Black Caps," said the leader, "what is ther fate
we-uns gives ter revenues?"Every man in the circle uttered the word, and they spoke all together."Now, why are we assembled ter-night?""Ter dispose o' spies," chorused the Black Caps.Each one of the black-hooded band extended a hand and pointed straight
at the captive boys."They shall be hanged," solemnly said the men.cried the leader, as if well satisfied.In a moment one of the men brought forth a rope.This was long enough to
serve for both boys, and it was quickly cut in two pieces, while
skillful hands proceeded to form nooses."Frankie," said Barney Mulloy, sadly, "we're done for.""It looks that way," Frank was forced to admit."Oi wouldn't moind so much," said the Irish lad, ruefully, "av we could
kick th' booket foighting fer our loives; but it is a bit harrud ter go
under widout a chance to lift a hand.""That's right," cried Frank, as he strained fiercely at the cords which
held his hands behind his back."It is the death of a criminal, and I
object to it."The leader of the Black Caps rode close to the boys, leaned forward in
his saddle, and hissed in Frank's ear:

"It's my turn now!""We-uns is goin' ter put two revenues
out o' ther way, that's all!""It's murder," cried Frank, in a ringing tone."You know we are not
revenue spies!We can prove that we are what we
claim to be--two boys who are tramping through the mountains for
pleasure.Will you kill us without giving us a chance to prove our
innocence?""It's ther same ol' whine," he said."Ther revenues alwus cry baby when
they're caught.You-uns can't fool us, an' we ain't got time ter waste
with ye.About the boys' necks the fatal ropes were quickly adjusted."If you murder us, you will find you have not
killed two friendless boys.We have friends--powerful friends--who will
follow this matter up--who will investigate it.You will be hunted down
and punished for the crime."Do you-uns think ye're stronger an' more
po'erful than ther United States Gover'ment?Ther United States
loses her spies, an' she can't tell who disposed o' 'em.We won't be
worried by all yore friends."He made another movement, and the rope ends were flung over a limb that
was strong enough to bear both lads.Hope was dying within Frank Merriwell's breast.At last he had reached
the end of his adventurous life, which had been short and turbulent.He
must die here amid these wild mountains, which flung themselves up
against the moonlit sky, and the only friend to be with him at the end
was the faithful friend who must die at his side.Frank's blood ran cold and sluggish in his veins.The spring night had
seemed warm and sweet, filled with the droning of insects; but now there
was a bitter chill in the air, and the white moonlight seemed to take on
a crimson tinge, as of blood.The boy's nature rebelled against the thought of meeting death in such a
manner.It was spring-time amid the mountains; with him it was the
spring-time of life.He had enjoyed the beautiful world, and felt strong
and brave to face anything that might come; but this he had not reckoned
on, and it was something to cause the stoutest heart to shake.Over the eastern mountains, craggy, wild, barren or pine-clad, the
gibbous moon swung higher and higher.The heavens were full of stars,
and every star seemed to be an eye that was watching to witness the
consummation of the tragedy down there in that little valley, through
which Lost Creek flowed on to its unknown destination.The silence was broken by a sound that made every black-hooded man start
and listen.Sweet and mellow and musical, from afar through the peaceful night, came
the clear notes of a bugle.Ta-ra-ta-ra-ta-ra-tar!Ta-ra-ta-ra-ta-ra-tar!A fierce exclamation broke from the lips of the leader of the Black
Caps, and he grated:

"Muriel, by ther livin' gods!Quick, boys--finish this
job, an' git!""If that is Muriel, wait
for him--let him pronounce our fate.He is the chief of you all, and he
shall say if we are revenue spies."You-uns know too much, fer ye've called my name!Ta-ra-ta-ra-ta-ra-tar!From much nearer, came the sound of the bugle, awakening hundreds of
mellow echoes, which were flung from crag to crag till it seemed that
the mountains were alive with buglers.The clatter of a horse's iron-shod feet could be heard, telling that the
rider was coming like the wind down the valley."Cut free ther feet o' ther pris'ners!"panted the leader of the Black
Caps.Muriel will be here in a few shakes, an' we-uns must
be done.Ta-ra-ta-ra-ta-ra-tar!Through the misty moonlight a coal-black horse, bearing a rider who once
more awakens the clamoring echoes with his bugle, comes tearing at a mad
gallop.repeats Wade Miller, fiercely, as the black-hooded men
seem to hesitate.One of the men utters the command, and his companions hesitate."Muriel is death on revernues," says the one who had spoken, "an' thar
ain't any reason why we-uns shouldn't wait fer him."More than half the men agree with the one who has interrupted the
execution, filling Wade Miller with unutterable rage.snarled the chief ruffian of the party."I am leadin' you-uns
now, an' ye've gotter do ez I say.I order ye ter string them critters
up!"Nearer and nearer came the clattering hoof-beats."Av we can have wan minute more!""Half a minute will do," returned Frank."We refuse ter obey ye now," boldly spoke the man who had commanded his
companions to stop."Muriel has signaled ter us, an' he means fer us ter
wait till he-uns arrives."He snatched out a revolver, pointed it straight at Frank's breast, and
fired!Just as the desperate ruffian was pulling the trigger, the man nearest
him struck up his hand, and the bullet passed through Frank's hat,
knocking it to the ground.Miller was furious as a maniac, but, at this moment, the black horse
and the dashing rider burst in upon the scene, plunged straight through
the circle, halting at the side of the imperiled lads, the horse being
flung upon its haunches."Wal, what be you-uns doin'?""What work
is this, that I don't know erbout?"Wade Miller cowered before the chief of the
moonshiners, trying to hide the revolver.Muriel's eyes, gleaming through the twin holes of the mask he wore,
found Miller, and the clear voice cried:

"You-uns has been lettin' this critter lead ye inter somethin'!An' it's
fair warnin' I gave him ter keep clear o' meddlin' with my business."The boys gazed at the moonshiner chief in amazement, for Muriel looked
no more than a boy as he sat there on his black horse, and his voice
seemed the voice of a boy instead of that of a man.Yet it was plain
that he governed these desperate ruffians of the mountains with a hand
of iron, and they feared him."We-uns war 'bout ter hang two revernues," explained Miller."How long sence ther gover'ment has
been sendin' boys hyar ter spy on us?""They know what happens ter ther men they send," muttered Miller."Wal, 'tain't like they'd be sendin' boys arter men failed.""That's ther way they hope ter fool us.""An' how do you know them-uns is revernues?""We jest s'picions it.""An' you-uns war hangin' 'em on s'picion, 'thout lettin' me know?""We never knows whar ter find ye, Muriel.""That is nary excuse, fer ef you-uns had held them-uns a day I'd knowed
it.It looks like you-uns war in a monstr'us hurry.""It war he-uns," declared one of the black hoods, pointing to Miller."We don't gener'ly waste much time in dinkerin' 'roun' with anybody
we-uns thinks is revernues," said Miller."Wal, we ain't got ther record o' killin' innercent boys, an' we don't
begin now.Two men hastened to obey the order, while Miller sat and grated his
teeth.As this was being done, Muriel asked:

"What war you-uns doin' with that revolver when I come?I heard ye
shoot, an' I saw ther flash.Miller stammered and stuttered till Muriel repeated the question, his
voice cold and hard, despite its boyish caliber."Wal," said Wade, reluctantly, "I'll have ter tell yer.I shot at
he-uns," and he pointed at Frank."I thought so," was all Muriel said.When the ropes were removed from the necks of the boys, Muriel directed
that their feet be tied again, and their eyes blindfolded.These orders were attended to with great swiftness, and then the
moonshiner chief said:

"Follow!"Out they rode from beneath the tree, and away through the misty
moonlight.Frank and Barney could not see, but they felt well satisfied with their
lot, for they had been saved from death for the time being, and,
somehow, they felt that Muriel did not mean to harm them."Frank," whispered Barney, "are yez there?""Here," replied Frank, close at hand."It's dead lucky we are to be livin', me b'y."I feel like singing a song of praise and
thanksgiving.But we're not out of the woods yet.""Thot Muriel is a dandy, Frankie!Oi'm shtuck on his stoyle."I wonder how he happened to appear at such an
opportune moment?""Nivver a bit do Oi know, but it's moighty lucky fer us thot he did."Frank fell to speculating over the providential appearance of the
moonshiner chief.It was plain that Muriel must have known that
something was happening, and he had signaled with the bugle to the Black
Caps.In all probability, other executions had taken place beneath that
very tree, for the young chief came there direct, without hesitation.For nearly an hour they seemed to ride through the night, and then they
halted.The boys were removed from the horses and compelled to march
into some kind of a building.After some moments, their hands were freed, and, tearing away the
blindfolds, they found themselves in a low, square room, with no
windows, and a single door.With his back to the door, stood Muriel.The light of a swinging oil lamp illumined the room.Muriel leaned gracefully against the door, his arms folded, and his eyes
gleaming where the lamplight shone on them through the twin holes in the
sable mask.The other moonshiners had disappeared, and the boys were alone in that
room with the chief of the mountain desperadoes.There was something strikingly cool and self-reliant in Muriel's
manner--something that caused Frank to think that the fellow, young as
he was, feared nothing on the face of the earth.At the same time there was no air of bravado or insolence about that
graceful pose and the quiet manner in which he was regarding them.Instead of that, the moonshiner was a living interrogation point,
everything about him seeming to speak the question that fell from his
lips."You must know
that we will lie if we are, and so you will hear our denial anyway."Look hyar--she tol' me fair an' squar' that you-uns warn't revernues,
but I dunno how she could tell."Frank fancied that he knew, but he put the question, and Muriel
answered:

"Ther gal that saved yore lives by comin' ter me an' tellin' me ther
boys had taken you outer her mammy's house."She did save our lives, for if you had been one minute
later you would not have arrived in time.Muriel moved uneasily, and he did not seem pleased by Frank's words,
although his face could not be seen.It was some moments before he
spoke, but his voice was strangely cold and hard when he did so."It's well ernough fer you-uns ter remember her, but ye'd best take car'
how ye speak o' her.She's got friends in ther maountings--true
friends."Frank was startled, and he felt the hot blood rush to his face.Then, in
a moment, he cried:

"Friends!Well, she has no truer friends than the boys she saved
to-night!I hope you will not misconstrue our words, Mr.A sound like a smothered laugh came from behind that baffling mask, and
Muriel said:

"Yo're hot-blooded.I war simply warnin' you-uns in advance, that's all.We esteem Miss Kenyon too highly to say
anything that can give a friend of hers just cause to strike against
us.""Wal, city chaps are light o' tongue, an' they're apt ter think that
ev'ry maounting girl is a fool ef she don't have book learnin'.Some
city chaps make their boast how easy they kin'mash' such gals.Anything
like that would count agin' you-uns."Frank was holding himself in check with an effort."It is plain you do not know us, and you have greatly misjudged us.We
are not in the mountains to make'mashes,' and we are not the kind to
boast of our conquests.""Thot's right, me jool!"growled Barney, whose temper was started a bit."An' it's mesilf thot loikes to be suspected av such a thing.It shtirs
me foighting blud."The Irish lad clinched his fist, and felt of his muscle, moving his
forearm up and down, and scowling blackly at the cool chief of
moonshiners, as if longing to thump the fellow.This seemed to amuse Muriel, but still he persisted in further arousing
the lads by saying, insinuatingly:

"I war led ter b'lieve that Kate war ruther interested in you-uns by her
manner.Thar don't no maounting gal take so much trouble over strangers
fer nothin'!"Frank bit his lip, and Barney looked blacker than ever.It seemed that
Muriel was trying to draw them into a trap of some sort, and they were
growing suspicious.Had this young leader of mountain ruffians rescued
them that he might find just cause or good excuse to put them out of the
way?The boys were silent, and Muriel forced a laugh."Wal, ye won't talk about that, an' so we'll go onter somethin' else.I
judge you-uns know yo're in a po'erful bad scrape?"exclaimed Barney, feeling of his neck, and
making a wry face, as if troubled by an unpleasant recollection."It is a scrape that you-uns may not be able ter git out of easy,"
Muriel said."I war able ter save yer from bein' hung 'thout any show at
all, but ye're not much better off now.""If you were powerful enough to save us in the first place, you should
be able to get us out of the scrape entirely.""You-uns don't know all about it.Moonshiners have laws an' regulations,
an' even ther leader must stan' by them."Frank was still troubled by the unpleasant suspicion that Muriel was
their enemy, after all that had happened.He felt that they must guard
their tongues, for there was no telling what expression the fellow might
distort and turn against them.Seeing neither of the lads was going to speak, Muriel went on:

"Yes, moonshiners have laws and regulations.Ther boys came nigh
breakin' one o' ther laws by hangin' you-uns ter-night 'thout givin' ye
a show.""Then we are to have a fair deal?""Ez fair ez anybody gits," assured Muriel, tossing back a lock of his
coal-black hair, which he wore long enough to fall to the collar of his
coat."Ain't that all ye kin ask?"That depends on what kind of a deal it is.""Wall, ye'll be given yore choice."If it is proven that we are revenue spies,
we'll have to take our medicine.But if it is not proven, we demand
immediate release.""Take my advice; don't demand anything o' ther Black Caps.Ther more ye
demand, ther less ye git.""We have a right to demand a fair deal.""Right don't count in this case; it is might that holds ther fort.You-uns stirred up a tiger ag'in' ye when you made Wade Miller mad.It's
a slim show that ye escape ef we-uns lets yer go instanter.He'd foller
yer, an' he'd finish yer somewhar."We have taken care of ourselves so
far, and we think we can continue to do so.All we ask is that we be set
at liberty and given our weapons.""An' ye'd be found with yer throats cut within ten miles o' hyar.""Wal, 'cordin' to our rules, ye can't be released onless ther vote ur
ther card sez so.""Wal, it's like this: Ef it's put ter vote, one black bean condemns
you-uns ter death, an' ev'ry man votes black ur white, as he chooses.I
don't judge you-uns care ter take yer chances that way?""Oi sh'u'd soay not!Ixchuse us from thot, me hearty!""There would be one
vote against us--one black bean thrown, at least.""Pwhat av th' carruds?""Two men will be chosen, one ter hold a pack o' cards, and one to draw a
card from them.Ef ther card is red, it lets you-uns off, fer it means
life; ef it is black, it cooks yer, fer it means death."The boys were silent, dumfounded, appalled.Muriel stood watching them, and Frank fancied that his eyes were
gleaming with satisfaction.The boy began to believe he had mistaken the
character of this astonishing youth; Muriel might be even worse than his
older companions, for he might be one who delighted in torturing his
victims.Frank threw back his head, defiance and scorn written on his handsome
face."It is a clean case of murder, at best!"he cried, his voice ringing out
clearly."We deserve a fair trial--we demand it!""Wal," drawled the boy moonshiner, "I warned you-uns that ther more yer
demanded, ther less yer got."We're in fur it, Frankie, me b'y!""If we had our revolvers, we'd give them a stiff fight for it!""They would not murder us till a few of them had eaten
lead!""You-uns has stuff, an' when I tell yer that ye'll have ter sta' ter
vote ur take chances with ther cards, I don't judge you'll hesitate."Then, make it the cards," said Frank, hoarsely."That will give us an
even show, if the draw is a fair one.""I'll see ter that," assured Muriel.Without another word, he turned and swiftly slipped out of the room.They heard him bar the door, and then they stood looking into each
other's faces, speechless for a few moments."It's a toss-up, Barney," Frank finally observed."Thot's pwhat it is, an' th' woay our luck is runnin' Oi think it's a
case av heads they win an' tails we lose.""But there is no way out of it."Pwhat do yez think av thot Muriel?""Worse than thot, me b'y--he's a cat's cradle toied in a hundred an'
sivintane knots.""It is impossible to tell whether he is friendly or whether he is the
worst foe we have in these mountains.""Oi wonder how Kate Kenyon knew where to foind him so quick?"She must have found him in a very short time
after we were taken from the cabin.""An' she diskivered thot we hed been taken away moighty soon afther we
wur gone, me b'y.It may have aroused Kate and her
mother, and caused them to investigate.""Loikely thot wur th' case, fer it's not mesilf thot would think she'd
kape shtill an' let ther spalpanes drag us away av she knew it.""No; I believe her utterly fearless, and it is plain that Wade Miller is
not the only one in love with her.""Mebbe ye're roight, Frankie."The fellow tried to lead me into a trap--tried
to get me to boast of a mash on her.I could see his eyes gleam with
jealousy.In her eagerness to save us--to have him aid her in the
work--she must have led him to suspect that one of us had been making
love to her."Barney whistled a bit, and then he shyly said:

"Oi wunder av wan of us didn't do a bit av thot?""We talked in a friendly manner--in fact, she
promised to be a friend to me.I may have expressed admiration for her
hair, or something of the sort, but I vow I did not make love to her.""Well, me b'y, ye have a thrick av gettin' all th' girruls shtuck on yez
av ye look at thim, so ye didn't nade ter make love.""It's nivver a fault at all, at all, me lad.Oi wish Oi wur built th'
soame woay, but it's litthle oice I cut wid th' girruls.This south av
Oireland brogue thot Oi foind mesilf unable to shake counts against me a
bit, Oi belave.""I should think Miller and Muriel would clash.""It's plain enough that Miller is afraid av Muriel.""And Muriel intends to keep him thus.I fancy it was a good thing for us
that Kate Kenyon suspected Wade Miller of having a hand in our capture,
and told Muriel that we had been carried off by him, for I fancy that is
exactly what happened.Muriel was angry with Miller, and he seized the
opportunity to call the fellow down.But for that, he might not have
made such a hustle to save us.""Thin we should be thankful thot Muriel an' Miller do not love ache
ither."The boys continued to discuss the situation for some time, and then they
fell to examining the room in which they were imprisoned.It did not
seem to have a window anywhere, and the single door appeared to be the
only means of entering or leaving the place."There's little show of escaping from this room," said Frank."This wur built to kape iverything safe
thot came in here."A few minutes later there was a sound at the door, and Muriel came in,
with two of the Black Caps at his heels."Ther boys have agreed ter give ye ther chance o' ther cards," said the
boy moonshiner."An' yo're goin' ter have a fair an' squar' deal.""We will have to submit," said Frank, quietly."You will have ter let ther boys bind yer hands afore ye leave this
room," said Muriel.The men each held the end of a stout rope, and the boys were forced to
submit to the inconvenience of having their hands bound behind them.Barney protested, but Frank kept silent, knowing it was useless to say
anything.When their hands were tied, Muriel said:

"Follow."He led the way, while Frank came next, with Barney shuffling sulkily
along at his heels.They passed through a dark room and entered another room, which was
lighted by three oil lamps.The room was well filled with the
black-hooded moonshiners, who were standing in a grim and silent
circle, with their backs against the walls.Into the center of this circle, the boys were marched.The door closed,
and Muriel addressed the Black Caps."It is not often that we-uns gives our captives ther choice uv ther
cards or ther vote, but we have agreed ter do so in this case, with only
one objectin', an' he war induced ter change his mind.Now we mean ter
have this fair an' squar', an' I call on ev'ry man present ter watch out
an' see that it is.Ther men has been serlected, one ter hold ther cards
an' one ter draw.Two of the Black Caps stepped out, and Frank started a bit, for he
believed one of them was Wade Miller.A pack of cards was produced, and Muriel shuffled them with a skill that
told of experience, after which he handed them to one of the men.Frank watched every move, determined to detect the fraud if possible,
should there be any fraud.An awed hush seemed to settle over the room.The men who wore the black hoods leaned forward a little, every one of
them watching to see what card should be drawn from the pack.Barney Mulloy caught his breath with a gasping sound, and then was
silent, standing stiff and straight.Muriel was as alert as a panther, and his eyes gleamed through the holes
in his mask like twin stars.The man who received the pack from Muriel stepped forward, and Miller
reached out his hand to draw.Then Frank suddenly cried:

"Wait!That we may be satisfied we are having a fair show in this
matter, why not permit one of us to shuffle those cards?"Quick as a flash of light, Muriel's hand fell on the wrist of the man
who held the cards, and his clear voice rang out:

"Stop!Frank's hands were unbound, and he was given the cards.He shuffled
them, but he did not handle them with more skill than had Muriel.He
"shook them up" thoroughly, and then passed them back to the man who
was to hold them.Muriel's order was swiftly obeyed, and Frank was again helpless.Wade Miller reached out, and quickly made the
draw, holding the fateful card up for all to see.From beneath the black hoods sounded the terrible word, as the man
beheld the black card which was exposed to view.Frank's heart dropped like a stone into the depths of his bosom, but no
sound came from his lips.Barney Mulloy showed an equal amount of nerve.Indeed, the Irish lad
laughed recklessly as he cried:

"It's nivver a show we had at all, at all, Frankie.Th' snakes had it
fixed fer us all th' toime."The words came from Muriel, and the boy chief of the moonshiners made a
spring and a grab, snatching the card from Miller's hand.Let's give ther critters a fair
show.""Do you mean ter say they didn't have a fair show?""Not knowin' it," answered Muriel."But ther draw warn't fair, jes' ther
same."One is ther ace o' spades, an' ther other is ther
nine o' hearts."Exclamations of astonishment came from all sides, and a ray of hope shot
into Frank Merriwell's heart.Ther black card war ther one exposed, an' that settles what'll be
done with ther spies.""Them boys is goin' ter
have a squar' show."It was with the greatest difficulty that Miller held himself in check.His hands were clinched, and Frank fancied that he longed to spring upon
Muriel.The boy chief was very cool as he took the pack of cards from the hand
of the man who had held them."Release one of the prisoners," was his command."The cards shall be
shuffled again."Once more Frank's hands were freed, and again the cards were given him
to shuffle.He mixed them deftly, without saying a word, and gave them
back to Muriel.Then his hands were tied, and he awaited the second
drawing."Be careful an' not get two cards this time," warned Muriel as he faced
Miller."This draw settles ther business fer them-uns."The cards were given to the man who was to hold them, and Miller stepped
forward to draw.Again the suspense became great, again the men leaned forward to see the
card that should be pulled from the pack; again the hearts of the
captives stood still.He seemed to feel that the tide had turned against
him.For a moment he was tempted to refuse to draw, and then, with a
muttered exclamation, he pulled a card from the pack and held it up to
view.Then, with a bitter cry of baffled rage, he flung it madly to the
floor.Each man in the room seemed to draw a deep breath.It was plain that
some were disappointed, and some were well satisfied."They-uns won't be put out o'
ther way ter-night.""An' I claim that it don't," returned the youthful moonshiner, without
lifting his voice in the least."You-uns all agreed ter ther second
draw, an' that lets them off.""But
them critters ain't out o' ther maountings yit!""By that yer mean--jes' what?""They're not liable ter git out alive.""Ef they-uns is killed, I'll know whar ter look fer ther one as war at
ther bottom o' ther job--an' I'll look!"Muriel did not bluster, and he did not speak above an ordinary tone, but
it was plain that he meant every word."Wal," muttered Miller, "what do ye mean ter do with them critters--turn
'em out, an' let 'em bring ther officers down on us?"I'm goin' ter keep 'em till they kin be escorted out o' ther
maountings.Thar ain't time ter-night, fer it's gittin' toward mornin'.Ter-morrer night it can be done."He seemed to know it was useless to make further
talk, but Frank and Barney knew that they were not yet out of danger.The boys seemed as cool as any one in the room, for all of the deadly
peril they had passed through, and Muriel nodded in a satisfied way when
he had looked them over."Come," he said, in a low tone, "you-uns will have ter go back ter ther
room whar ye war a bit ago."They were willing to go back, and it was with no small amount of relief
that they allowed themselves to be escorted to the apartment.Muriel dismissed the two guards, and then he set the hands of the boys
free."Suspecting you of double-dealing."It seemed that you had saved us from being
hanged, but that you intended to finish us here.""Ef that war my scheme, why did I take ther trouble ter save ye at all?""It looked as if you did so to please Miss Kenyon.You had saved us, and
then, if the men disposed of us in the regular manner, you would not be
to blame."Muriel shook back his long, black hair, and his manner showed that he
was angry.He did not feel at all pleased to know his sincerity had been
doubted."Wal," he said, slowly, "ef it hadn't been fer me you-uns would be gone
<DW53>s now.""You-uns know I saved ye, but ye don't know how I done it."There was something of bitterness and reproach in the voice of the
youthful moonshiner.He continued:

"I done that fer you I never done before fer no man.I wouldn't a done
it fer myself!""Do you-uns want ter know what I done?""When I snatched ther first card drawn from ther hand o' ther man what
drawed it.It war ther ace o' spades, an' it condemned yer ter die."Thar war one card drawed, an' that war all!""That war whar I cheated," he said, simply."I had ther red card in my
hand ready ter do ther trick ef a black card war drawed.In that way I
knowed I could give yer two shows ter escape death."The boys were astounded by this revelation, but they did not doubt that
Muriel spoke the truth.His manner showed that he was not telling a
falsehood.And this strange boy--this remarkable leader of moonshiners--had done
such a thing to save them!More than ever, they marveled at the fellow.Once more Muriel's arms were folded over his breast, and he was leaning
gracefully against the door, his eyes watching their faces.For several moments both boys were stricken dumb with wonder and
surprise.Frank was not a little confused, thinking as he did how he had
misunderstood this mysterious youth.It seemed most unaccountable that he should do such a thing for two
lads who were utter strangers to him.A sound like a bitter laugh came from behind the sable mask, and Muriel
flung out one hand, with an impatient gesture."I know what you-uns is thinkin' of," declared the young moonshiner."Ye
wonder why I done so.Wal, I don't jes' know myself, but I promised Kate
ter do my best fer ye."cried Frank, "kept it nobly!Muriel, you
may be a moonshiner, you may be the leader of the Black Caps, but I am
proud to know you!I believe you are white all the way through!"exclaimed the youth, with a show of satisfaction, "that makes me
feel better.But it war Kate as done it, an' she's ther one ter thank;
but it ain't likely you-uns'll ever see her ag'in.""Then, tell her," said Frank, swiftly, "tell her for us that we are very
thankful--tell her we shall not forget her.He seemed about to speak, and then checked
himself."I'll tell her," nodded Muriel, his voice sounding a bit strange."Is
that all you-uns want me ter tell her?""Tell her I would give much to see her again," came swiftly from Frank's
lips."She's promised to be my friend, and right well has she kept that
promise.""Then I'll have ter leave you-uns now.Breakfast will be brought ter ye, and when another night comes, a guard
will go with yer out o' ther maountings.He held out a hand, and Muriel seemed to hesitate.After a few moments,
the masked lad shook his head, and, without another word, left the room.cried Barney, scratching his head, "thot felly is worse than
Oi thought!Oi don't know so much about him now as Oi did bafore Oi met
him at all, at all!"They made themselves as
comfortable as possible, and talked over the thrilling events of the
night."If Kate Kenyon had not told me that her brother was serving time as a
convict, I should think this Muriel must be her brother," said Frank."Av he's not her brither, it's badly shtuck on her he must be, Oi
dunno," observed Barney."An' av he be shtuck on her, pwhoy don't he git
onter th' collar av thot Miller?"Finally, when they had tired
of talking, the boys lay down and tried to sleep.Frank was beginning to doze when his ears seemed to detect a slight
rustling in that very room, and his eyes flew open in a twinkling.He
started up, a cry of wonder surging to his lips, and being smothered
there.Kate Kenyon stood within ten feet of him!As Frank started up, the girl swiftly placed a finger on her lips,
warning him to be silent.Frank sprang to his feet, and Barney Mulloy sat up, rubbing his eyes and
beginning to speak."Pwhat's th' matter now, me b'y?Are yez---- Howly shmoke!"Barney clasped both hands over his mouth, having caught the warning
gestures from Frank and the girl.Still the exclamation had escaped his
lips, although it was not uttered loudly.Swiftly Kate Kenyon flitted across the room, listening with her ear to
the door to hear any sound beyond.After some moments, she seemed
satisfied that the moonshiners had not been aroused by anything that had
happened within that room, and she came back, standing close to Frank,
and whispering:

"Ef you-uns will trust me, I judge I kin git yer out o' this scrape."exclaimed Frank, softly, as he caught her hand."We have
you to thank for our lives!Kate--your pardon!--Miss Kenyon, how can we
ever repay you?""Don't stop ter talk 'bout that now," she said, with chilling
roughness."Ef you-uns want ter live, an' yer want ter git erway frum
Wade Miller, git reddy ter foller me.""But how are we to leave this room?She silently pointed to a dark opening in the corner, and they saw that
a small trapdoor was standing open."We kin git out that way," she said.The boys wondered why they had not discovered the door when they
examined the place, but there was no time for investigation.Kate Kenyon flitted lightly toward the opening.Pausing beside it, she
pointed downward, saying:

"Go ahead; I'll foller and close ther door."The boys did not hesitate, for they placed perfect confidence in the
girl now.Barney dropped down in advance, and his feet found some rude
stone steps.In a moment he had disappeared, and then Frank followed.As lightly as a fairy, Kate Kenyon dropped through the opening, closing
the door behind her.The boys found themselves in absolute darkness, in some sort of a
narrow, underground place, and there they paused, awaiting their guide.Her hand touched Frank as she slipped past, and he
caught the perfume of wild flowers.To him she was like a beautiful wild
flower growing in a wilderness of weeds.The boys heard the word, and they moved slowly forward through the
darkness, now and then feeling dank walls on either hand.For a considerable distance they went on in this way, and then the
passage seemed to widen out, and they felt that they had entered a cave."Keep close ter me," directed the girl.Now you-uns can't git astray."At last a strange smell came to their nostrils, seemingly on the wings
of a light breath of air."Ther mill whar ther moonshine is made."Never for a moment did she
hesitate; she seemed to have the eyes of an owl.All at once they heard the sound of gently running water."Lost Creek runs through har," answered the girl.So the mysterious stream flowed through this cavern, and the cave was
near one of the illicit distilleries.Frank cared to know no more, for he did not believe it was healthy to
know too much about the makers of moonshine.It was not long before they approached the mouth of the cave.They saw
the opening before them, and then, of a sudden, a dark figure arose
there--the figure of a man with a gun in his hands!FRANK'S SUSPICION.Kate uttered the words, and the boys began to recover from their alarm,
as she did not hesitate in the least.I put him thar ter watch
out while I war in hyar."Of a sudden, Kate struck a match, holding it so the
light shone on her face, and the figure at the mouth of the cave was
seen to wave its hand and vanish."Ther coast is clear," assured the girl."But it's gittin' right nigh
mornin', an' we-uns must hustle away from hyar afore it is light.The boys were well satisfied to get away as quickly as possible.They passed out of the dark cavern into the cool, sweet air of a spring
morning, for the gray of dawn was beginning to dispel the darkness, and
the birds were twittering from the thickets.The phantom of a moon was in the sky, hanging low down and half-inverted
as if spilling a spectral glamour over the ghostly mists which lay deep
in Lost Creek Valley.The sweet breath of flowers and of the woods was in the morning air, and
from some cabin afar on the side of a distant mountain a wakeful
watchdog barked till the crags reverberated with his clamoring."Thar's somethin' stirrin' at 'Bize Wiley's, ur his dorg wouldn't be
kickin' up all that racket," observed Kate Kenyon."He lives by ther
road that comes over from Bildow's Crossroads.Folks comin' inter ther
maountings from down below travel that way."The boys looked around for the mute who had been guarding the mouth of
the cave, but they saw nothing of him.He had slipped away into the
bushes which grew thick all around the opening."Come on," said the girl, after seeming strangely interested in the
barking of the dog."We'll git ter ther old mill as soon as we kin.Foller me, an' be ready ter scrouch ther instant anything is seen."Now that they could see her, she led them forward at a swift pace, which
astonished them both.She did not run, but she seemed to skim over the
ground, and she took advantage of every bit of cover till they entered
some deep, lowland pines.Through this strip of woods she swiftly led them, and they came near to
Lost Creek, where it flowed down in the dismal valley.There they found the ruins of an old mill, the moss-covered water-wheel
forever silent, the roof sagging and falling in, the windows broken out
by mischievous boys, the whole presenting a most melancholy and deserted
appearance.The road that had led to the mill from the main highway was overgrown
with weeds.Later it would be filled with thistles and burdocks.Wild
sassafras grew along the roadside."That's whar you-uns must hide ter-day," said Kate, motioning toward the
mill."We are not criminals, nor are we
revenue spies.I do not fancy the idea of hiding like a hunted dog.""It's better ter be a live dorg than a dead lion.Ef you-uns'll take my
advice, you'll come inter ther mill thar, an' ye'll keep thar all day,
an' keep mighty quiet.I know ye're nervy, but thar ain't no good in
bein' foolish.It'll be known that you-uns have escaped, an' then Wade
Miller will scour ther country.Ef he come on yer----"

"Give us our arms, and we'll be ready to meet Mr."But yer wouldn't meet him alone; thar'd be others with him, an' you-uns
wouldn't have no sorter show."Kate finally succeeded in convincing the boys that she spoke the truth,
and they agreed to remain quietly in the old mill.She led them into the mill, which was dank and dismal.The imperfect
light failed to show all the pitfalls that lurked for their feet, but
she warned them, and they escaped injury.The miller had lived in the mill, and the girl took them to the part of
the old building that had served as a home."Har," she said, opening a closet door, "I've brung food fer you-uns, so
yer won't starve, an' I knowed ye'd be hongry.""You are more than thoughtful, Miss Kenyon.""Yer seem ter have fergot what we agreed ter call each other, Frank."She spoke the words in a tone of reproach.Barney turned away, winking uselessly at nothing at all, and kept his
back toward them for some moments.But Frank Merriwell had no thought of making love to this strange girl
of the mountains.She had promised to be his friend; she had proved
herself his friend, and as no more than a friend did he propose to
accept her.That he had awakened something stronger than a friendly feeling in Kate
Kenyon's breast seemed evident, and the girl was so artless that she
could not conceal her true feelings toward him.They stood there, talking in a low tone, while the morning light stole
in at one broken window and grew stronger and stronger within that room.As he did so a new thought
came to him--a thought that was at first a mere suspicion, which he
scarcely noted at all.This suspicion grew, and he found himself asking:

"Kate, are you sure your brother is still wearing a convict's suit?""You do not know that he is dead--you have not heard of his death?"Her eyes flashed, and a look of pride swept across her face."Folks allus 'lowed Rufe Kenyon wa'n't afeard o' ary two-legged critter
livin', an' they war right."She clutched his arm, beginning to pant, as she asked:

"What makes you say that?I knowed he'd try it some day, but--but, have
you heard anything?The suspicion leaped to a conviction in the twinkling of an eye.If Rufe
Kenyon was not at liberty, then he must be right in what he thought."I do not know that your brother has tried to escape.I did think that he might be Muriel, the
moonshiner.""You-uns war plumb mistooken thar," she said, positively."Rufe is not
Muriel.""Then," cried Frank, "you are Muriel yourself!""Have you-uns gone plumb dafty?"asked the girl, in a dazed way."But you are--I am sure of it," said Frank, swiftly.Of course I'm not Muriel; but he's ther best
friend I've got in these maountings."Frank was far from satisfied, but he was too courteous to insist after
this denial.Kate laughed the idea to scorn, saying over and over that
the boy must be "dafty," but still his mind was unchanged.To be sure, there were some things not easily explained, one being how
Muriel concealed her luxurious red hair, for Muriel's hair appeared to
be coal-black.Another thing was that Wade Miller must know Muriel and Kate were one
and the same, and yet he preserved her secret and allowed her to snatch
his victims from his maws.Barney Mulloy had been more than astounded by Frank's words; the Irish
youth was struck dumb.When he could collect himself, he softly
muttered:

"Well, av all th' oideas thot takes th' cake!"Having seen them safely within the mill and shown them the food brought
there, Kate said:

"Har is two revolvers fer you-uns.Don't use 'em unless yer have ter,
but shoot ter kill ef you're forced."Oi'm ready fer th' spalpanes!"cried Barney, as he grasped one
of the weapons."Next time Wade Miller and his
gang will not catch us napping.""Roight, me b'y; we'll be sound awake, Frankie."Kate bade them good-by, assuring them that she would return with the
coming of another night, and making them promise to await her, and then
she flitted away, slipped out of the mill, soon vanishing amid the
pines."It's dead lucky we are ter be living, Frankie," observed Barney."I quite agree with you," laughed Merriwell."This night has been a
black and tempestuous one, but we have lived through it, and I do not
believe we'll find ourselves in such peril again while we are in the
Tennessee mountains."They were hungry, and they ate heartily of the plain food that had been
provided for them.When breakfast was over, Barney said:

"Frankie, it's off yer trolley ye git sometoimes.""What do you mean by that, Barney?Oi wur thinkin' av pwhat yez said about Kate Kenyon being
Mooriel, th' moonshoiner.""I was not off my trolley so very much then.""G'wan, me b'y!"You think so, but I have made a study of Muriel and of Kate Kenyon.I
am still inclined to believe the moonshiner is the girl in disguise.""An' Oi say ye're crazy.No girrul could iver do pwhat thot felly does,
an' no band av min loike th' moonshoiners would iver allow a girrul
loike Kate Kenyon ter boss thim.""They do not know Muriel is a girl.That is, I am sure the most of them
do not know it--do not dream it.""Thot shows their common sinse, fer Oi don't belave it mesilf.""I may be wrong, but I shall not give it up yet.""Whoy, think pwhat a divvil thot Muriel is!An' th' color av his hair is
black, whoile the girrul's is red.""I have thought of those things, and I have wondered how she concealed
that mass of red hair; still I am satisfied she does it.""Well, it's no use to talk to you at all, at all."However, they did discuss it for some time.Finally they fell to exploring the old mill, and they wandered from one
part to another till they finally came to the place where they had
entered over a sagging plank.They were standing there, just within the
deeper shadow of the mill, when a man came panting and reeling from the
woods, his hat off, his shirt torn open at the throat, great drops of
perspiration standing on his face, a wild, hunted look in his eyes, and
dashed to the end of the plank that led over the water into the old
mill.Frank clutched Barney, and the boys fell back a step, watching the man,
who was looking back over his shoulder and listening, the perfect
picture of a hunted thing."They're close arter me--ther dogs!"came in a hoarse pant from the
man's lips."But I turned on 'em--I doubled--an' I hope I fooled 'em.It's my last chance, fer I'm dead played, and I'm so nigh starved that
it's all I kin do ter drag one foot arter t'other."He listened again, and then, as if overcome by a sudden fear of being
seen there, he suddenly rushed across the plank and plunged into the
mill.In the twinkling of an eye man and boy were clasped in a close embrace,
struggling desperately.He tried to hurl Frank to the floor, and he would have succeeded had he
been in his normal condition, for he was a man of great natural
strength; but he was exhausted by flight and hunger, and, in his
weakened condition, the man found his supple antagonist too much for
him.A gasp came from the stranger's lips as he felt the boy give him a
wrestler's trip and fling him heavily to the floor.When he opened his eyes, Frank and
Barney were bending over him."Wal, I done my best," he said, huskily; "but you-uns trapped me at
last.I dunno how yer knew I war comin' har, but ye war on hand ter meet
me.""You have made a mistake," said Frank, in a reassuring tone."We are not
your enemies at all.""We are not your enemies; you are not trapped."The man seemed unable to believe what he heard."Fugitives, like yourself," assured Frank, with a smile.He looked them over, and shook his head.I'm wore ter ther bone--I'm a
wreck!Oh, it's a cursed life I've led sence they dragged me away from
har!Night an' day hev I watched for a chance ter break away, and' I war
quick ter grasp it when it came.They shot at me, an' one o' their
bullets cut my shoulder har.It war a close call, but I got away.Then
they follered, an' they put houn's arter me.Twenty times hev they been
right on me, an' twenty times hev I got erway.But it kep' wearin' me
weaker an' thinner.My last hope war ter find friends ter hide me an'
fight fer me, an' I came har--back home!I tried ter git inter 'Bije
Wileys' this mornin', but his dorg didn't know me, I war so changed, an'
ther hunters war close arter me, so I hed ter run fer it."exclaimed Barney; "we hearrud th' dog barruckin'.""So we did," agreed Frank, remembering how the creature had been
clamoring on the mountainside at daybreak."I kem har," continued the man, weakly."I turned on ther devils, but
when I run in har an' you-uns tackled me, I judged I had struck a trap.""It was no trap, Rufe Kenyon," said Frank, quietly.The hunted man started up and slunk away."An' still ye say you-uns are not my enemies.""No; but we have heard of you.""She saved us from certain death last night, and she brought us here to
hide till she can help us get out of this part of the country.""I judge you-uns is givin' it ter me straight," he said, slowly; "but I
don't jes' understan'."What had moonshiners agin' you-uns?"Well, we are not spies; but we were unfortunate enough to incur the
enmity of Wade Miller, and he has sworn to end our lives."cried Rufe, showing his teeth in an ugly manner."An' I
s'pose he's hangin' 'roun' Kate, same as he uster?""He is giving her more or less trouble.""Wal, he won't give her much trouble arter I git at him.I'm goin' ter tell you-uns somethin'.Miller allus pretended
ter be my friend, but it war that critter as put ther revernues onter me
an' got me arrested!He done it because I tol' him Kate war too good fer
him.I know it, an' one thing why I wanted ter git free war ter come har
an' fix ther critter so he won't ever bother Kate no more.I hev swore
ter fix him, an' I'll do it ef I live ter meet him face ter face!"He had grown wildly excited, and he sat up, with his back against a
post, his eyes gleaming redly, and a white foam flecking his lips.At
that moment he reminded the boys of a mad dog.When Kenyon was calmer, Frank told the story of the adventures which had
befallen the boys since entering Lost Creek Valley.The fugitive
listened quietly, watching them closely with his sunken eyes, and,
having heard all, said:

"I judge you-uns tells ther truth.Ef I kin keep hid till Kate gits
har--till I see her--I'll fix things so you won't be bothered much.Wade
Miller's day in Lost Creek Valley is over."The boys took him up to the living room of the old mill, where they
furnished him with the coarse food that remained from their breakfast.He ate like a famished thing, washing the dry bread down with great
swallows of water.When he had finished and his hunger was satisfied, he
was quite like another man.he cried; "now I am reddy fer anything!"And you'll tell me ef thar's danger?"So the hunted wretch was induced to lie down and sleep.He slept soundly
for some hours, and, when he opened his eyes, his sister had her arms
about his neck.He sat up and clasped her in his arms, a look of joy on his face.It is quite unnecessary to describe the joys of that meeting.The boys
had left brother and sister alone together, and the two remained thus
for nearly an hour, at the end of which time Rufe knew all that had
happened since he was taken from Lost Creek Valley, and Kate had also
been made aware of the perfidy of Wade Miller."I judge it is true that bread throwed on ther waters allus comes back,"
said Kate, when the four were together."Now looker how I helped
you-uns, an' then see how it turned out ter be a right good thing fer
Rufe.He found ye har, an' you-uns hev fed him an' watched while he
slept.""An' I hev tol' Kate all about Wade Miller," said the fugitive."That settles him," declared the girl, with a snap."Kate says ther officers think I hev gone on over inter ther next cove,
an' they're arter me, all 'ceptin' two what have been left behind.They'll be back, though, by night.""But you are all right now, for your friends will be on hand by that
time.""Yes; Kate will take word ter Muriel, an' he'll hev ther boys ready ter
fight fer me.Ther officers will find it kinder hot in these parts.""I'd better be goin' now," said the girl."Ther boys oughter know all
about it soon as possible.""That's right," agreed Rufe."This ain't ther best place fer me ter
hide.""No," declared Kate, suddenly; "an' yer mustn't hide har longer, fer
ther officers may come afore night.It
won't do fer ther boys ter go thar, but you kin all right.Ther boys is
best off har, fer ther officers wouldn't hurt 'em."This seemed all right, and it was decided on.Just as they were on the point of descending, Barney gave a cry, caught
Frank by the arm, and drew him toward a window."Phwat do yez think av it
now?"A horseman was coming down the old road that led to the mill.He
bestrode a coal-black horse, and a mask covered his face, while his
long, black hair flowed down on the collar of the coat he wore.He sat
the horse jauntily, riding with a reckless air that seemed to tell of a
daring spirit."An' it's your trate, me lad.""I will treat," said Frank, crestfallen."I am not nearly so smart as I
thought I was."cried Kate, dashing to the window.She did not hesitate to appear in the window and signal to the dashing
young moonshiner, who returned her salute, and motioned for her to come
out."He wants ter see me in er hurry," said the girl."I sent word ter him
by Dummy that ther boys war har, an' that's how he happened ter turn up.Come, Rufe, go out with me.Muriel will be glad to see yer.""And I shall be glad ter see him," declared the escaped convict.Kate bade the boys remain there, telling them she would call them if
they were wanted, and then, with Rufe following, she hurried down the
stairs, and hastened to meet the boy moonshiner, who had halted on the
bank at some distance from the old mill.Watching from the window, Frank and Barney saw her hasten up to Muriel,
saw her speak swiftly, although they could not hear her words, saw
Muriel nod and seem to reply quite as swiftly, and then saw the young
leader of the Black Caps shake her hand in a manner that denoted
pleasure and affection."Ye're a daisy, Frankie, me b'y," snickered Barney Mulloy; "but fer
wance ye wur badly mishtaken.""I was all of that," confessed Frank, as if slightly ashamed."I thought
myself far shrewder than I am."As they watched, they saw Rufe Kenyon suddenly leap up behind Muriel,
and then the doubly burdened horse swung around and went away at a hot
pace, while Kate came flitting back into the mill."The officers are returnin'," she explained."Muriel will take Rufe whar
thar ain't no chance o' their findin' him.You-uns will have ter stay
har.I have brung ye more fodder, an' I judge you'll git along all
right."So she left them hurriedly, being greatly excited over the return of her
brother and his danger.The day passed, and the officers failed to appear in the vicinity of the
mill, although the boys were expecting to see them.When night came Frank and Barney grew impatient, for they were far from
pleased with their lot, but they could do nothing but wait.Two hours after nightfall a form suddenly appeared in the old mill,
rising before the boys like a phantom, although they could not
understand how the fellow came there.In a flash Frank snatched out a revolver and pointed it at the intruder,
crying, sternly:

"Stand still and give an account of yourself!Who are you, and what do
you want?"The figure moved into the range of the window, so that the boys could
see him making strange gestures, pointing to his ears, and pressing his
fingers to his lips."If you don't keep still, I shall shoot.Still the intruder continued to make those strange gestures, pointing to
his ears, and touching his lips.That he saw Frank's revolver glittering
and feared the boy would shoot was evident, but he still remained
silent."Whoy don't th' spalpane spake?""Is it no tongue he has,
Oi dunno?""Perhaps he cannot speak, in which case he is the one Kate calls Dummy.It happened that the sign language of mutes was one of Frank's
accomplishments, he having taken it up during his leisure moments.He
passed the revolver to Barney, saying:

"Keep the fellow covered, while I see if I can talk with him."Frank moved up to the window, held his hands close to the intruder's
face, and spelled:

"You from Kate?"He put up his hands and spelled back:

"Kate send me.Frank interpreted for Barney's benefit, and the Irish lad cried:

"Thin let's be movin'!It's mesilf that's ready ter git out av thase
parruts in a hurry, Oi think."For a moment Frank hesitated about trusting the mute, and then he
decided that it was the best thing to do, and he signaled that they were
ready.Dummy led the way from the mill, crossing by the plank, and plunging
into the pine woods."He sames to be takin' us back th' woay we came, Frankie," said the
Irish lad, in a low tone."He said the horses were waiting for
us.The mute flitted along with surprising silence and speed, and they found
it no easy task to follow and keep close enough to see him.Now and then
he looked back to make sure they were close behind.At last they came to the termination of the pines, and there, in the
deep shadows, they found three horses waiting.Frank felt disappointed, for he wished to see the girl before leaving
the mountains forever.He did not like to go away without touching her
hand again, and expressing his sense of gratitude for the last time.It was his hope that she might join them before they left the mountains.The horses were saddled and bridled, and the boys were about to mount
when a strange, low cry broke from Dummy's lips.There was a sudden stir, and an uprising of dark forms on all sides.Frank tried to snatch out his revolver, but it was too late.He was
seized, disarmed, and crushed to the earth."Did you-uns think ye war goin'
ter escape?Wal, yer didn't know Wade Miller very well.I knowed Kate'd
try ter git yer off, an' all I hed ter do war watch her.I didn't waste
my time runnin' round elsewhar."They were once more in Miller's clutches!He blamed himself for falling
into the trap, and still he could not see how he was to blame.Surely he
had been cautious, but fate was against him.He had escaped Miller
twice; but this was the third time, and he feared that it would prove
disastrous.The hands of the captured boys were tied behind their backs, and then
they were forced to march swiftly along in the midst of the Black Caps
that surrounded them.They were not taken to the cave, but straight to one of the hidden
stills, a little hut that was built against what seemed to be a wall of
solid rock, a great bluff rising against the face of the mountain.Thick
trees concealed the little hut down in the hollow.Some crude candles were lighted, and they saw around them the outfit for
making moonshine whiskey.cried Miller, triumphantly; "you-uns will never go out o' this
place.Ther revernues spotted this still ter-day, but it won't be har
ter-morrer."He made a signal, and the boys were thrown to the floor, where they were
held helpless, while their feet were bound.When this job was finished Miller added:

"No, ther revernues won't find this still ter-morrer, fer it will go up
in smoke.Moonshine is good stuff ter burn, an' we'll see how you-uns
like it."At a word a keg of whiskey was brought to the spot by two men."Let 'em try ther stuff," directed Miller.he's goin' ter fill us up bafore he finishes us!"But that was not the intention of the revengeful man.A plug was knocked from a hole in the end of the keg, and then the
whiskey was poured over the clothing of the boys, wetting them to the
skin.The men did not stop pouring till the clothing of the boys was
thoroughly saturated.said Miller, with a fiendish chuckle, "I reckon you-uns is ready
fer touchin' off, an' ye'll burn like pine knots.Ther way ye'll holler
will make ye heard clean ter ther top o' Black Maounting, an' ther fire
will be seen; but when anybody gits har, you-uns an' this still will be
ashes."He knelt beside Frank, lighted a match, and applied it to the boy's
whiskey-soaked clothing!The flame almost touched Frank's clothing when the boy rolled
over swiftly, thus getting out of the way for the moment.At the same instant the blast of a bugle was heard at the very front of
the hut, and the door fell with a crash, while men poured in by the
opening.rang out a clear voice; "but Muriel!"The boy chief of the Black Caps was there."An' Muriel is not erlone!""Rufe Kenyon is
har!"Out in front of Muriel leaped the escaped criminal, confronting the man
who had betrayed him.Miller staggered, his face turning pale as if struck a heavy blow, and a
bitter exclamation of fury came through his clinched teeth.roared Kate Kenyon's brother, as a long-bladed knife
glittered in his hand, and he thrust back the sleeve of his shirt till
his arm was bared above the elbow."I swore ter finish yer, Miller; but
I'll give ye a squar' show!Draw yer knife, an' may ther best man win!"With the snarl that might have come from the throat of a savage beast,
Miller snatched out a revolver instead of drawing a knife.he screamed; "but I'll shoot ye plumb through ther
heart!"He fired, and Rufe Kenyon ducked at the same time.There was a scream of pain, and Muriel flung up both hands, dropping
into the arms of the man behind.Rufe Kenyon had dodged the bullet, but the boy chief of the Black Caps
had suffered in his stead.Miller seemed dazed by the result of his shot.The revolver fell from
his hand, and he staggered forward, groaning:

"Kate!--I've killed her!"Rufe Kenyon forgot his foe, dropping on one knee beside the prostrate
figure of Muriel, and swiftly removing the mask.panted her brother, "be ye dead?Her eyes opened, and she faintly said:

"Not dead yit, Rufe."Then the brother shouted:

"Ketch Wade Miller!It seemed that every man in the hut leaped to obey.Miller struggled like a tiger, but he was overpowered and dragged out of
the hut, while Rufe still knelt and examined his sister's wound, which
was in her shoulder.Frank and Barney were freed, and they hastened to render such assistance
as they could in dressing the wound and stanching the flow of blood."You-uns don't think that'll be fatal, do yer?"asked Rufe, with
breathless anxiety."There is no reason why it should," assured Frank."She must be taken
home as soon as possible, and a doctor called.I think she will come
through all right, for all of Miller's bullet."The men were trooping back into the hut.roared Rufe, leaping to his feet."He is out har under a tree," answered one of the men, quietly."Who's watchin' him ter see that he don't git erway?"Why, ther p'izen dog will run fer it!""I don't think he'll run fur."Wal, ter make sure he wouldn't run, we hitched a rope around his neck
an' tied it up ter ther limb o' ther tree.Unless ther rope stretches,
he won't be able ter git his feet down onter ther ground by erbout
eighteen inches."muttered Rufe, with a sad shake of his head."I wanted ter
squar 'counts with ther skunk."Kate Kenyon was taken home, and the bullet was extracted from her
shoulder.The wound, although painful, did not prove at all serious, and
she began to recover in a short time.Frank and Barney lingered until it seemed certain that she would
recover, and then they prepared to take their departure.After all, Frank's suspicion had proved true, and it had been revealed
that Muriel was Kate in disguise.Frank chaffed Barney a great deal about it, and the Irish lad took the
chaffing in a good-natured manner.Rufe Kenyon was hidden by his friends, so that his pursuers were forced
to give over the search for him and depart.One still was raided, but not one of the moonshiners was captured, as
they had received ample warning of their danger.On the evening before Frank and Barney were to depart in the morning,
the boys carried Kate out to the door in an easy-chair, and they sat
down near her.Kenyon sat on the steps and smoked her black pipe, looking as
stolid and indifferent as ever."Kate," said Frank, "when did you have your hair cut short?Where is
that profusion of beautiful hair you wore when we first saw you?""Why, my har war cut more'n a year ago.I had it
made inter a'switch,' and I wore it so nobody'd know I had it cut.""You did that in order that you might wear the black wig when you
personated Muriel?""You could do that easily over your short hair.""Well, you played the part well, and you made a dashing boy.But how
about the Muriel who appeared while you were in the mill with us?""You-uns war so sharp that I judged I'd make yer think ye didn't know
so much ez you thought, an' I fixed it up ter have another person show
up in my place."He is no bigger than I, an' he is a good mimic."It's mesilf thot wur chated, an'
thot's not aisy.""You are a shrewd little girl," declared Frank; "and you are dead lucky
to escape with your life after getting Miller's bullet.But Miller won't
trouble you more."Kenyon rose and went into the hut, while Barney lazily strolled
down to the creek, leaving Frank and Kate alone.Half an hour later, as he was coming back, the Irish lad heard Kate
saying:

"I know I'm igerent, an' I'm not fitten fer any educated man.Still, you
an' I is friends, Frank, an' friends we'll allus be.""Friends we will always be," said Frank, softly.It was not long before our friends left the locality, this time bound
for Oklahoma, Utah and California.What Frank's adventures were in those
places will be told in another volume, entitled, "Frank Merriwell's
Bravery.""We are well out of that," said Frank, as they journeyed away."To tell the whole thruth,
me b'y, ye're nivver wrong, nivver!"Occasionally a net breaks from the floats and drags on
the bottom.This is covered with cinders thrown out by steamers, and they
play the mischief.""Usually, but they come in on both sides."Marks, how can you catch fish in a net that is straight up and
down?""You'll soon see, but I'll explain.The meshes of the net will stretch
five inches.A shad swims into one of these and then, like many others
that go into things, finds he can't back out, for his gills catch on the
sides of the mesh and there he hangs.Occasionally a shad will just
tangle himself up and so be caught, and sometimes we take a large striped
bass in this way."In answer to a question of Burt's he continued: "I just let my net float
with the tide as you see, giving it a pull from one end or the other now
and then to keep it as straight and as near at right angles with the
river as possible.When the tide stops running out and turns a little we
begin at one end of the net and pull it up, taking out the fish, at the
same time laying it carefully in folds on a platform in the stern-sheets,
so as to prevent any tangles.If the net comes up clear and free, I may
throw it in again and float back with the tide.So far from being able to
depend on this, we often have to go ashore where there is a smooth beach
before our drift is over and disentangle our net.There, now, I'm
through, with paying out.Haven't you noticed the floats bobbing here and
there?""We've been too busy listening and watching you," said Leonard.If you see one bob under and wobble, a shad
has struck the net near it, and I can go and take him out.In smooth
water it's like fishing with one of your little cork bobblers there on
your lines.I'll give the shad to the first one that sees a float bob
under."Alf nearly sprang out of the boat as he pointed and shouted, "There,
there."Laughing good-naturedly, Mr.Marks lifted the net beneath the float, and,
sure enough, there was a great roe-shad hanging by his gills, and Alf
gloated over his supper, already secured.The fish were running well, and there were excited calls and frantic
pointings, in which at first even the older members of the party joined,
and every few moments a writhing shad flashed in the slanting rays as it
was tossed into the boat.Up and down the long, irregular line of floats
the boats passed and repassed until excitement verged toward satiety, and
the sun, near the horizon, with a cloud canopy of crimson and gold,
warned the merry fishers by proxy that their boats should be turned
homeward.Leonard pulled out what he termed his silver hook, and supplied
not only the Clifford family, but all of Johnnie's guests, with fish so
fresh that they had as yet scarcely realized that they were out of water."Now, Amy," said Burt, "keep stroke with me," adding, in a whisper, "no
fear but that we can pull well together."Her response was, "One always associates a song with rowing.Come, strike
up, and let us keep the boats abreast that all may join."He, well content, started a familiar boating song, to which the splash of
their oars made musical accompaniment.A passing steamer saluted them,
and a moment later the boats rose gracefully over the swells.The glassy
river flashed back the crimson of the clouds, the eastern <DW72>s of the
mountains donned their royal purple, the intervening shadows of valleys
making the folds of their robes.As they approached the shore the
resonant song of the robins blended with the human voices.Burt, however,
heard only Amy's girlish soprano, and saw but the pearl of her teeth
through her parted lips, the rose in her cheeks, and the snow of her
neck.Final words were spoken and all were soon at home.Maggie took the
household helm with a fresh and vigorous grasp.The maids never dawdled when she directed, and by the time
the hungry fishermen were ready, the shad that two hours before had been
swimming deep in the Hudson lay browned to a turn on the ample platter."It is this quick transition that gives to game fish their most exquisite
flavor," Burt remarked."Are shad put down among the game fish?""Yes; they were included not very long ago, and most justly, too, as I
can testify to-night.I never tasted anything more delicious, except
trout.If a shad were not so bony it would be almost perfection when
eaten under the right conditions.Not many on the Hudson are aware of the
fact, perhaps, but angling for them is fine sport in some rivers.They
will take a fly in the Connecticut and Housatonic; but angle-worms and
other bait are employed in the Delaware and Southern rivers.The best
time to catch them is early in the morning, and from six to eight in the
evening.At dusk one may cast for them in still water, as for trout.The
Hudson is too big, I suppose, and the water too deep, although I see no
reason why the young fry should not be caught in our river as well as in
the Delaware.I have read of their biting voraciously in September at a
short distance above Philadelphia.""Do you mean to say that our rivers are full of shad in August and
September?""Yes; that is, of young shad on the way to the sea.The females that are
running up now will spawn in the upper and shallow waters of the river,
and return to the ocean by the end of June, and in the autumn the small
fry will also go to the sea, the females to remain there two years.The
males will come back next spring, and these young males are called
'chicken shad' on the Connecticut.Multitudes of these half-grown fish
are taken in seines, and sold as herrings or 'alewives'; for the true
herring does not run up into fresh water.Young shad are said to have
teeth, and they live largely on insects, while the full-grown fish have
no teeth, and feed chiefly on animalcules that form the greater part of
the slimy growths that cover nearly everything that is long under water.""Well, I never had so much shad before in my life," said his father,
laughing, and pushing lack his chair; "and, Burt, I have enjoyed those
you have served up in the water almost as much as those dished under
Maggie's superintendence.""I should suppose that the present mode of fishing with drift-nets was
cheaper and more profitable than the old method of suspending the nets
between poles," Leonard remarked."It is indeed," Burt continued, vivaciously, for he observed that Amy was
listening with interest."Poles, too, form a serious obstruction.Once,
years ago, I was standing near the guards of a steamboat, when I heard
the most awful grating, rasping sound, and a moment later a shad-pole
gyrated past me with force enough to brain an elephant had it struck him.It was good fun, though, in old times to go out and see them raise the
nets, for they often came up heavy with fish.Strange to say, a loon was
once pulled up with the shad.Driven by fear, it must have dived so
vigorously as to entangle itself, for there it hung with its head and one
leg fast.I suppose that the last moment of consciousness that the poor
bird had was one of strong surprise."CHAPTER XXVIII

MAY AND GIRLHOOD


May came in reality the following morning.Perhaps she thought that the
leisure of Sunday would secure her a more appreciative welcome.The wind
no longer blew from the chill and still snowy North, but from lands that
had long since responded to the sun's genial power.Therefore, the breeze
that came and went fitfully was like a warm, fragrant breath, and truly
it seemed to breathe life and beauty into all things.During the morning
hours the cluster buds of the cherry burst their varnished-looking
sheath, revealing one-third of the little green stems on which the
blossoms would soon appear.The currant-bushes were hanging out their
lengthening racemes, and the hum of many bees proved that honey may be
gathered even from gooseberry-bushes, thus suggesting a genial philosophy.The sugar-maples were beginning to unfold their leaves and to dangle their
emerald gold flowers from long, drooping pedicles.Few objects have more
exquisite and delicate beauty than this inflorescence when lighted up by
the low afternoon sun.The meadows and oat fields were passing into a vivid
green, and the hardy rye had pushed on so resolutely in all weathers, that
it was becoming billowy under the wind.All through the week the hues of
life and beauty became more and more apparent upon the face of Nature, and
by the following Saturday May had provided everything in perfection for
Johnnie's coronation ceremonies.For weeks past there had been distinguished arrivals from the South
almost daily.Some of these songsters, like the fox-sparrow, sojourned a
few weeks, favoring all listeners with their sweet and simple melodies;
but the chief musician of the American forests, the hermit thrush, passed
silently, and would not deign to utter a note of his unrivalled minstrelsy
until he had reached his remote haunts at the North.Marvin evidently
had a grudge against this shy, distant bird, and often complained, "Why
can't he give us a song or two as he lingers here in his journey?I often
see him flitting about in the mountains, and have watched him by the hour
with the curiosity that prompts one to look at a great soprano or tenor,
hoping that he might indulge me with a brief song as a sample of what he
could do, but he was always royally indifferent and reserved.I am going to
the Adirondacks on purpose to hear him some day.There's the winter wren,
too-saucy, inquisitive little imp!--he was here all winter, and has left us
without vouchsafing a note.But, then, great singers are a law unto
themselves the world over."But the doctor had small cause for complaint, for there are few regions
more richly endowed with birds than the valley of the Hudson.As has been
seen, it is the winter resort of not a few, and is, moreover, a great
highway of migration, for birds are ever prone to follow the watercourses
that run north and south.The region also affords so wide a choice of
locality and condition that the tastes of very many birds are suited.There are numerous gardens and a profusion of fruit for those that are
half domesticated; orchards abounding in old trees with knotholes,
admirably fitted for summer homes; elms on which to hang the graceful
pensile nests--"castles in air," as Burroughs calls them; meadows in
which the lark, vesper sparrow, and bobolink can disport; and forests
stretching up into the mountains, wherein the shyest birds can enjoy all
the seclusion they desire, content to sing unheard, as the flowers around
them bloom unseen, except by those who love them well enough to seek them
in their remotest haunts.The week which preceded the May party was a memorable one to Amy, for
during its sunny days she saw an American spring in its perfection.Each
morning brought rich surprises to her, Johnnie, and Alf, and to Webb an
increasing wonder that he had never before truly seen the world in which
he lived.The pent-up forces of Nature, long restrained, seemed finding
new expression every hour.Tulips opened their gaudy chalices to catch
the morning dew.Massive spikes of hyacinths distilled a rich perfume
that was none too sweet in the open air.Whenever Amy stepped from the
door it seemed that some new flower had opened and some new development
of greenery and beauty had been revealed.But the crowning glory in the
near landscape were the fruit trees.The cherry boughs grew white every
day, and were closely followed by the plum and pear and the pink-hued
peach blossoms.Even Squire Bartley's unattractive place was transformed
for a time into fairyland; but he, poor man, saw not the blossoms, and
the birds and boys stole his fruit.Amy wondered at the wealth of flowers
that made many of the trees as white as they had been on the snowiest day
of winter, and Johnnie revelled in them, often climbing up into some
low-branched tree, that she might bury herself in their beauty, and
inhale their fragrance in long breaths of delight.The bees that filled
the air about her with their busy hum never molested her, believing, no
doubt, that she had as good a right as themselves to enjoy the sweets in
her way.Clifford, perhaps, who obtained the
profoundest enjoyment from the season.Seated by her window or in a sunny
corner of the piazza, she would watch the unfolding buds as if she were
listening to some sweet old story that had grown dearer with every
repetition.Indeed, this was true, for with the blossoms of every year
were interwoven the memories of a long life, and their associations had
scarcely ever been more to her heart than the new ones now forming.She
often saw, with her children and grandchildren, the form of a tall girl
passing to and fro, and to her loving eyes Amy seemed to be the fairest
and sweetest flower of this gala period.She, and indeed they all, had
observed Burt's strongly manifested preference, but, with innate
refinement and good sense, there had been a tacit agreement to appear
blind.The orphan girl should not be annoyed by even the most delicate
raillery, but the old lady and her husband could not but feel the deepest
satisfaction that Bart was making so wise a choice.They liked Amy all
the better because she was so little disposed to sentiment, and proved
that she was not to be won easily.But they all failed to understand her, and gave her credit for a maturity
that she did not possess.In her happy, healthful country life the
girlish form that had seemed so fragile when she first came to them was
taking on the rounded lines of womanhood.Why should she not be wooed
like other girls at her age?Burt was further astray than any one else,
and was even inclined to complain mentally that her nature was cold and
unresponsive.And yet her very reserve and elusiveness increased his
passion, which daily acquired a stronger mastery.Webb alone half guessed
the truth in regard to her.As time passed, and he saw the increasing
evidences of Burt's feeling, he was careful that his manner should be
strictly fraternal toward Amy, for his impetuous brother was not always
disposed to be reasonable even in his normal condition, and now he was
afflicted with a malady that has often brought to shame the wisdom of the
wisest.The elder brother saw how easily Burt's jealousy could be
aroused, and therefore denied himself many an hour of the young girl's
society, although it caused him a strange little heartache to do so.But
he was very observant, for Amy was becoming a deeply interesting study.He saw and appreciated her delicate fence with Burt, in which tact,
kindness, and a little girlish brusqueness were almost equally blended.Was it the natural coyness of a high-spirited girl, who could be won only
by long and patient effort?or was it an instinctive self-defence from a
suit that she could not repulse decisively without giving pain to those
she loved?Their home-life, even at that busy
season, gave him opportunities to see her often, and glimmerings of the
truth began to dawn upon him.He saw that she enjoyed the society of Alf
and Johnnie almost as much as that of the other members of the family,
that her delight at every new manifestation of spring was as unforced as
that of the children, while at the same time it was an intelligent and
questioning interest.The beauty of the world without impressed her
deeply, as it did Johnnie, but to the latter it was a matter of course,
while to Amy it was becoming an inviting mystery.The little girl would
bring some new flower from the woods or garden, the first of the season,
in contented triumph, but to Amy the flower had a stronger interest.It
represented something unknown, a phase of life which it was the impulse
of her developing mind to explore.Her botany was not altogether
satisfactory, for analysis and classification do not reveal to us a
flower or plant any more than the mention of a name and family connection
makes known individual character.Her love for natural objects was too
real to be satisfied with a few scientific facts about them.If a plant,
tree, or bird, interested her she would look at it with a loving,
lingering glance until she felt that she was learning to know it somewhat
as she would recognize a friend.The rapid changes which each day brought
were like new chapters in a story, or new verses in a poem.She watched
with admiring wonder the transition of buds into blossoms; and their
changes of form and color.She shared in Alf's excitement over the
arrival of every new bird from the South, and, having a good ear for
music, found absorbing pleasure in learning and estimating the quality
and characteristics of their various songs.Their little oddities
appealed to her sense of humor.A pair of cat-birds that had begun their
nest near the house received from her more ridicule than admiration."They seem to be regular society birds and gossips," she said, "and I can
never step out-of-doors but I feel that they are watching me, and trying
to attract my attention.They have a pretty song, but they seem to have
learned it by heart, and as soon as they are through they make that
horrid noise, as if in their own natural tone they were saying something
disagreeable about you."But on the morning of Johnnie's coronation she was wakened by songs as
entrancing as they were unfamiliar.Running to the window, she saw
darting through the trees birds of such a brilliant flame color that they
seemed direct from the tropics, and their notes were almost as varied as
their colors.She speedily ceased to heed them, however, for from the
edge of the nearest grove came a melody so ethereal and sustained that it
thrilled her with the delight that one experiences when some great singer
lifts up her voice with a power and sweetness that we feel to be divine.At the same moment she saw Alf running toward the house.Seeing her at
the window, he shouted, "Amy, the orioles and the wood-thrushes--the
finest birds of the year--have come.Hurry up and go with me to the grove
yonder."Soon after Webb, returning from a distant field to breakfast, met her
near the grove.She was almost as breathless and excited as the boy, and
passed him with a bright hurried smile, while she pressed on after her
guide with noiseless steps lest the shy songster should be frightened.He
looked after her and listened, feeling that eye and ear could ask for no
fuller enchantment.At last she came back to him with the fresh loveliness
of the morning in her face, and exclaimed, "I have seen an ideal bird, and
he wears his plumage like a quiet-toned elegant costume that simply
suggests a perfect form.He was superbly indifferent, and scarcely looked
at us until we came too near, and then, with a reserved dignity, flew away.He is the true poet of the woods, and would sing just as sweetly if there
was never a listener."Yes, he is a poet, and your true
aristocrat, who commands admiration without seeking it," Webb replied."I am sure he justifies all your praises, past and present.Oh, isn't the
morning lovely--so fresh, dewy, and fragrant?and the world looks so
young and glad!""You also look young and glad this morning, Amy."This May beauty makes me feel as young as Alf," she
replied, placing her hand on the boy's shoulder.Her face was flushed with exercise; her step buoyant; her eyes were
roaming over the landscape tinted with fruit blossoms and the expanding
foliage.Webb saw in what deep accord her spirit was with the season, and
he thought, "She _is_ young--in the very May of her life.She is scarcely
more ready for the words that Burt would speak than little Johnnie.I
wish he would wait till the girl becomes a woman;" and then for some
reason he sighed deeply.Amy gave him an arch look, and said:

"Then came from the depths, Webb.What secret sorrow can you have on a
day like this?"Oh, isn't it
beautiful?--almost equal to the thrush's song.He seems to sing as if
his notes were written for him in couplets."She spoke at intervals,
looking toward the grove they had just left, and when the bird paused
Webb replied:

"That is the wood-thrush's own cousin, and a distinguished member of the
thrush family, the brown-thrasher.Well, Johnnie," he added, to the
little girl who had come to meet them, "you are honored to-day.Three of
our most noted minstrels have arrived just in time to furnish music for
the May Queen."But Johnnie was not surprised, only pleased, as Webb and others
congratulated her.She would be queen that day with scarcely more
self-consciousness than one of the flowers that decked her.It was the
occasion, the carnival of spring, that occupied her thoughts, and, since
the fairest blossoms of the season were to be gathered, why should not
the finest birds be present also?Feeling that he had lost an opportunity in the improvised festival of the
maple-sugar grove, Burt resolved to make the most of this occasion, and
he had the wisdom to decide upon a course that relieved Amy of not a
little foreboding.He determined to show his devotion by thoughtful
considerateness, by making the day so charming and satisfactory as to
prove that he could be a companion after her own heart.And he succeeded
fairly well for a time, only the girl's intuition divined his motive and
guessed his sentiments.She was ever in fear that his restraint would
give way.And yet she felt that she ought to reward him for what she
mentally termed his "sensible behavior" and indicate that such should be
his course in the future.In
spite of all the accumulated beauty of the season the day was less
bright, less full of the restful, happy _abandon_ of the previous one in
March, when Webb had been her undemonstrative attendant.He, with
Leonard, at that busy period found time to look in upon the revellers in
the woods but once.Clifford spent more time with them, but the old
gentleman was governed by his habit of promptness, and the time called
for despatch.For the children, however, it was a revel that left nothing to be
desired.They had decided that it should be a congress of flowers, from
the earliest that had bloomed to those now opening in the sunniest
haunts.Alf, with one or two other adventurous boys, had climbed the
northern face of old Storm King, and brought away the last hepaticas,
fragrant clusters of arbutus, and dicentras, for "pattykers, arbuties,
and Dutcher's breeches," as Ned called them, were favorites that could
not be spared.On a sunny <DW72> dogwood, well advanced, was found.There
were banks white with the rue-anemone, and they were marked, that some of
the little tuber-like roots might be taken up in the fall for forcing in
the house.Myriads of violets gave a purple tinge to parts of a low
meadow near, and chubby hands were stained with the last of the star-like
bloodroot blossoms, many of which dropped white petals on their way to
Johnnie's throne.Some brought handfuls of columbine from rocky nooks,
and others the purple trillium, that is near of kin to Burroughs's white
"wake-robin."There were so many Jacks-in-the-pulpit that one might fear
a controversy, but the innumerable dandelions and dogtooth violets which
carpeted the ground around the throne diffused so mellow a light that all
the blossoms felt that they looked well and were amiable.But it would
require pages even to mention all the flowers that were brought from
gardens, orchards, meadows, groves, and rugged mountain <DW72>s.Each
delegation of blossoms and young tinted foliage was received by Amy, as
mistress of ceremonies, and arranged in harmonious positions; while
Johnnie, quite forgetful of her royalty, was as ready to help at anything
as the humblest maid of honor.All the flowers were treated tenderly
except the poor purple violets, and these were slaughtered by hundreds,
for the projecting spur under the curved stem at the base of the flower
enabled the boys to hook them together, and "fight roosters," as they
termed it.Now and then some tough-stemmed violet would "hook-off" a
dozen blue heads before losing its own, and it became the temporary hero.At last the little queen asserted her power by saying, with a sudden
flash in her dark blue eyes, that she "wouldn't have any more fighting
roosters.By one o'clock the queen had been crowned, the lunch had met the capacity
of even the boys, and the children, circling round the throne, were
singing: "Oats, peas, beans, and barley grows," and kindred rhymes, their
voices rising and falling with the breeze, the birds warbling an
accompaniment.Webb and Leonard, at work in a field not far away, often
paused to listen, the former never failing to catch Amy's clear notes as
she sat on a rock, the gentle power behind the throne, that had maintained
peace and good-will among all the little fractious subjects.The day had grown almost sultry, and early in the afternoon there was a
distant jar of thunder.Burt, who from a bed of dry leaves had been
watching Amy, started up and saw that there was an ominous cloud in the
west.She agreed with him that it would be prudent to return at once, for
she was growing weary and depressed.Burt, with all his effort to be
quietly and unobtrusively devoted, had never permitted her to become
unconscious of his presence and feeling.Therefore her experience had
been a divided one.She could not abandon herself to her hearty sympathy
with the children and their pleasure, for he, by manner at least, ever
insisted that she was a young lady, and the object of thoughts all too
warm.Her nature was so fine that it was wounded and annoyed by an
unwelcome admiration.She did not wish to think about it, but was not
permitted to forget it.She had been genial, merry, yet guarded toward
him all day, and now had begun to long for the rest and refuge of her own
room.He felt that he had not made progress, and was also depressed, and
he showed this so plainly on their way home that she was still more
perplexed and troubled."If he would only be sensible, and treat me as
Webb does!"she exclaimed, as she threw herself on the lounge in her
room, exhausted rather than exhilarated by the experience of the day.CHAPTER XXIX NATURE'S WORKSHOP


During the hour she slept an ideal shower crossed the sky.In the lower
strata of air there was scarcely any wind, and the rain came down
vertically, copiously, and without beating violence.The sun-warmed earth
took in every drop like a great sponge.Beyond the first muttered warning to the little May party in the grove
there was no thunder.The patter of the rain was a gentle lullaby to Amy,
and at last she was wakened by a ray of sunlight playing upon her face,
yet she still heard the soft fall of rain.With the elasticity of youth,
she sprang up, feeling that the other cloud that had shadowed her
thoughts might soon pass also.As she went singing down the stairway,
Webb called from the front door: "Amy, look here!The cloud still hung heavily over the eastern
mountains, while against it was a magnificent arch, and so distinctly
defined that its feet appeared to rest on the two banks of the river.They watched it in silence until it faded away, and the whole scene,
crowned with flowers and opening foliage tinted like blossoms of varied
hues, was gemmed with crystals by the now unclouded sun, for the soft
rain had clung to everything, from the loftiest tree-top to the tiniest
spire of grass.Flame-like orioles were flashing through the perfumed
air.Robins, with their heads lifted heavenward, were singing as
rapturously as if they were saints rather than rollicking gormandizers.Every bird that had a voice was lifting it up in thanksgiving, but clear,
sweet, and distinct above them all came the notes of the wood-thrush,
with his Beethoven-like melody."Have you no words for a scene like this, Webb?"My wonder
exceeds even my admiration, for the greater part of this infinite variety
of beauty is created out of so few materials and by so simple yet
mysterious a method that I can scarcely believe it, although I see it and
know it.Men have always agreed to worship the genius which could achieve
the most with the least.And yet the basis of nearly all we see is a
microscopic cell endowed with essential powers.That large apple-tree
yonder, whose buds are becoming so pink, started from one of these minute
cells, and all the growth, beauty, and fruitfulness since attained were
the result of the power of this one cell to add to itself myriads of like
cells, which form the whole structure.It is cell adding cells that is
transforming the world around us."He spoke earnestly, and almost as if
he were thinking aloud, and he looked like one in the presence of a
mystery that awed him.The hue of Amy's eyes deepened, and her face
flushed in her quickened interest.Her own mind had been turning to
kindred thoughts and questionings.She had passed beyond the period when
a mind like hers could be satisfied with the mere surface of things, and
Webb's direct approach to the very foundation principles of what she saw
sent a thrill through all her nerves as an heroic deed would have done."Can you not show me one of those cells with your microscope?""Yes, easily, and some of its contents through the cell's transparent
walls, as, for instance, the minute grains of _chlorophyll_, that is, the
green of leaves.All the hues of foliage and flowers are caused by what
the cells contain, and these, to a certain extent, can be seen and
analyzed.But there is one thing within the cell which I cannot show you,
and which has never been seen, and yet it accounts for everything, and is
the architect of all--life.When we reach the cell we are at the
threshold of this mysterious presence.We can
see its work, for its workshop is under our eye, and in this minute shop
it is building all the vegetation of the world, but the artisan itself
ever remains invisible.""Ah, Webb, do not say artisan, but rather artist.Does not the beauty all
around us prove it?Surely there is but one explanation, the one papa
taught me: it is the power of God.He is in the little as well as in the
great."Well, Amy," he replied, smilingly, "the faith taught you by your father
is, to my mind, more rational than any of the explanations that I have
read, and I have studied several.But then I know little, indeed,
compared with multitudes of others.I am sure, however, that the life of
God is in some way the source of all the life we see.But perplexing
questions arise on every side.Much of life is so repulsive and noxious--
But there!what a fog-bank I am leading you into this crystal May
evening!Most young girls would vote me an insufferable bore should I
talk to them in this style.""So much the worse for the young girls then.I should think they would
feel that no compliment could exceed that of being talked to as if they
had brains.But I do not wish to put on learned airs.You know how
ignorant I am of even the beginnings of this knowledge.All that I can
say is that I am not content to be ignorant.The curiosity of Mother Eve
is growing stronger every day; and is it strange that it should turn
toward the objects, so beautiful and yet so mysterious, that meet my eyes
on every side?""No," said he, musingly, "the strange thing is that people have so little
curiosity in regard to their surroundings.Why, multitudes of intelligent
persons are almost as indifferent as the cattle that browse around among
the trees and flowers.I once used to
investigate things, but did not see them.I have thought about it very
much this spring.It is said that great painters and sculptors study
anatomy as well as outward form.Perhaps here is a good hint for those
who are trying to appreciate nature.I am not so shallow as to imagine
that I can ever understand nature any more than I can you with your
direct, honest gaze.So to the thoughtful mystery is ever close at hand,
but it seems no little thing to trace back what one sees as far as one
can, and you have made me feel that it is a great thing to see the Divine
Artist's finished work."They were now joined by others, and the perfect beauty of the evening as
it slowly faded into night attracted much attention from all the family.The new moon hung in the afterglow of the western sky, and as the dusk
deepened the weird notes of the whip-poor-will were heard for the first
time from the mountain-sides.At the supper-table Leonard beamed on every one."A rain like this, after
a week of sunshine has warmed the earth" he exclaimed, "is worth millions
to the country."Yes," added his father, "the old Indian sign, the unfolding of the oak
leaves, indicates that it is now safe to plant.After long years of observation I am satisfied that the true secret
of success in farming is the doing of everything at just the right time.Crops put in too early or too late often partially fail; but if the right
conditions are complied with from the beginning, they start with a vigor
which is not lost until maturity."Burt indulged in a gayety that was phenomenal even for him, but after
supper he disappeared.Amy retired to her room early, but she sat a long
time at her window and looked out into the warm, fragrant night.She had
forgotten poor Burt, who was thinking of her, as in his unrest he rode
mile after mile, holding his spirited horse down to a walk.She had
almost forgotten Webb, but she thought deeply of his words, of the life
that was working all around her so silently and yet so powerfully.Unseen
it had created the beauty she had enjoyed that day.From the very
contrast of ideas it made her think of death, of her father, who once had
been so strong and full of life.The mystery of one seemed as great as
that of the other, and a loneliness such as she had not felt before for
months depressed her."I wish I could talk to Webb again," she thought."He says he does not
understand me.It would seem
that when one began to think nothing that appeared simple before is
understood; but his words are strong and assured.He leads one to the
boundaries of the known, and then says, quietly, we can go no further;
but he makes you feel that what is beyond is all right.Oh, I wish Burt
was like him!"CHAPTER XXX

SPRING-TIME PASSION


But little chance had Amy to talk with Webb for the next few days.He had
seen the cloud on Burt's brow, and had observed that he was suspicious,
unhappy, and irritable; that reason and good sense were not in the
ascendant; and he understood his brother sufficiently well to believe
that his attack must run its natural course, as like fevers had done
before.From what he had seen he also thought that Amy could deal with
Burt better than any one else, for although high-strung, he was also
manly and generous when once he got his bearings.In his present mood he
would bitterly resent interference from any one, but would be bound to
obey Amy and to respect her wishes.Therefore he took especial pains to
be most kindly, but also to appear busy and pre-occupied.It must not be thought that Burt was offensive or even openly obtrusive
in his attentions.He was far too well-bred for that.There was nothing
for which even his mother could reprove him, or of which Amy herself
could complain.It was the suit itself from which she shrank, or rather
which she would put off indefinitely.But Burt was not disposed to put
anything that he craved into the distance.Spring-tide impulses were in
his veins, and his heart was so overcharged that it must find expression.A long, exquisite day had merged into
a moonlight evening.The apple-blossoms were in all their white-and-pink
glory, and filled the summer-like air with a fragrance as delicate as
that of the arbutus.The petals of the cherry were floating down like
snow in every passing breeze, glimmering momentarily in the pale
radiance.The night was growing so beautiful that Amy was tempted to
stroll out in the grounds, and soon she yielded to a fancy to see the
effect of moonlight through an apple-tree that towered like a mound of
snow at some little distance from the house.She would not have been
human had the witchery of the May evening been without its influence.If
Burt could have understood her, this was his opportunity.If he had come
with step and tone that accorded with the quiet evening, and simply said,
"Amy, you know--you have seen that I love you; what hope can you give
me?"she in her present mood would have answered him as gently and
frankly as a child.She might have laughingly pointed him to the tree,
and said: "See, it is in blossom now.It will be a long time before you
pick the apples.If you will be sensible, and treat me as
you would Johnnie, were she older, I will ride and walk with you, and be
as nice to you as I can."But this Burt could not do and still remain Burt.He was like an
overcharged cloud, and when he spoke at last his words seemed to the
sensitive girl to have the vividness and abruptness of the lightning.It
was her custom to make a special toilet for the evening, and when she had
come down to supper with a rose in her hair, and dressed in some light
clinging fabric, she had proved so attractive to the young fellow that he
felt that the limit of his restraint was reached.He would appeal to her
so earnestly, so passionately, as to kindle her cold nature.In his lack
of appreciation of Amy he had come to deem this his true course, and she
unconsciously enabled him to carry out the rash plan.He had seen her
stroll away, and had followed her until she should be so far from the
house that she must listen.As she emerged from under the apple-tree,
through which as a white cloud she had been looking at the moon, he
appeared so suddenly as to startle her, and without any gentle reassurance
he seized her hand, and poured out his feelings in a way that at first
wounded and frightened her."Burt," she cried, "why do you speak to me so?Can't you see that I do
not feel as you do?I've given you no reason to say such words to me."Are you as cold and elusive as this moonlight?I
have waited patiently, and now I must and will speak.Every man has a
right to speak and a right to an answer.""Well then," she replied, her spirit rising; "if you will insist on my
being a woman instead of a young girl just coming from the shadow of a
great sorrow, I also have my rights.I've tried to show you gently and
with all the tact I possessed that I did not want to think about such
things.I'm just at the beginning of my girlhood and I want to be a young
girl as long as I can and not an engaged young woman.No matter who spoke
the words you have said, they would pain me.Why couldn't you see this
from my manner and save both yourself and me from this scene?I'll gladly
be your loving sister, but you must not speak to me in this way again.""You refuse me then," he said, throwing back his head haughtily.I simply tell you that I won't listen to such words from
any one.Why can't you be sensible and understand me?I no more wish to
talk about such things than do Alf and Johnnie.""I do understand you," he exclaimed, passionately, "and better perhaps
than you understand yourself.You are a woman, but
you seem to lack a woman's heart, as far as I am concerned;" and with a
gesture that was very tragic and despairing he strode away.She was deeply troubled and incensed also, and she returned to the house
with drooping head and fast-falling tears."Why, Amy, what is the matter?"Looking up, she saw Webb coming down the
piazza steps.Yielding to her impulse, she sprang forward and took his
arm, as she said:

"Webb, you have always acted toward me like a brother.is it unnatural in me that I do not wish to hear
such words as Burt would speak to-night?All I ask is that he will let me
stay a happy young girl till I am ready for something else.This is no
way for a flower to bloom"--she snatched the rose from her hair, and
pushed open the red petals--"and yet Burt expects me to respond at once
to feelings that I do not even understand.If it's best in the future--but
surely I've a right to my freedom for a long time yet.Tell me, do you
think I'm unnatural?""No, Amy," he answered, gently."It is because you are so perfectly
natural, so true to your girlhood, that you feel as you do.In that
little parable of the rose you explain yourself fully.You have no cause
for self-reproach, nor has Burt for complaint.You say you do not understand me, and yet always prove that
you do.If Burt would only treat me as you do, I should be perfectly
happy.""Well, Burt's good-hearted, but sometimes he mislays his judgment," said
Webb, laughing.There is no occasion for any high
tragedy on his part or for grieving on yours.You go and tell mother all
about it, and just how you feel.She is the right one to manage this
affair, and her influence over Burt is almost unbounded.Do this, and,
take my word for it, all will soon be serene."Amy felt that night what it is to have a mother's
boundless love and sympathy, and she went to her rest comforted, soothed,
and more assured as to the future than she had been for a long time."How
quiet and sensible Webb was about it all!"was her last smiling thought
before she slept.His thought as he strolled away in the moonlight after
she left him was, "It is just as if I half believed.She has the mind of
a woman, but the heart of a child.Burt did not stroll; he strode mile after mile, and the uncomfortable
feeling that he had been very unwise, to say the least, and perhaps very
unjust, was growing upon him.When at last he returned, his mother called
to him through the open door.Clifford always
obtained the confidence of her children, and they ever found that it was
sacred.All that can be said, therefore, was, that he came from her
presence penitent, ashamed, and hopeful.His mood may best be explained,
perhaps, by a note written before he retired."My dear sister Amy," it
ran, "I wish to ask your pardon.I was
so blinded and engrossed by my own feelings that I did not understand
you.I have proved myself unworthy of even a sister's love; but I will
try to make amends.Do not judge me harshly because I was so headlong.There is no use in trying to disguise the truth.What I have said so
unwisely and prematurely I cannot unsay, and I shall always be true to my
words.But I will wait patiently as long as you please; and if you find,
in future years, that you cannot feel as I do, I will not complain or
blame you, however sad the truth may be to me.In the meantime, let there
be no constraint between us.Let me become once more your trusted brother
Burt."This note he pushed under her door, and then slept too soundly for
the blighted youth he had a few hours before deemed himself.He felt a little embarrassed at the prospect of meeting her the next
morning, but she broke the ice at once by coming to him on the piazza and
extending her hand in smiling frankness as she said: "You are neither
unjust nor ungenerous, Burt, or you would not have written me such a
note.As you said the first evening I came, we
shall have jolly times together."The young fellow was immensely relieved and grateful, and he showed it.Soon afterward he went about the affairs of the day happier than he had
been for a long time.Indeed, it soon became evident that his explosion
on the previous evening had cleared the air generally.Amy felt that the
one threatening cloud had sunk below the horizon.As the days passed, and
Burt proved that he could keep his promise, her thoughts grew as serene
as those of Johnnie.Her household duties were not very many, and yet she
did certain things regularly.The old people found that she rarely forgot
them, and she had the grace to see when she could help and cheer.Attentions that must be constantly asked for have little charm.A day
rarely passed that did she not give one or more of its best hours to her
music and drawing; for, while she never expected to excel in these arts,
she had already learned that they would enable her to give much pleasure
to others.Her pencil, also, was of great assistance in her study of
out-door life, for the fixed attention which it required to draw a plant,
tree, or bit of scenery revealed its characteristics.She had been even
more interested in the unfolding of the leaf-buds than in the flowering
of the trees, and the gradual advance of the foliage, like a tinted
cloud, up the mountain-<DW72>s, was something she never tired of watching.When she spoke of this one day to Webb, he replied:

"I have often wondered that more is not said and written about our spring
foliage, before it passes into its general hue of green.To me it has a
more delicate beauty and charm than anything seen in October.Different
trees have their distinct coloring now as then, but it is evanescent, and
the shades usually are less clearly marked.This very fact, however,
teaches the eye to have a nicety of distinction that is pleasing."The blossoms faded from the trees, and
the miniature fruit was soon apparent.The strawberry rows, that had been
like lines of snow, were now full of little promising cones.The grass
grew so lusty and strong that the dandelions were hidden except as the
breeze caught up the winged seeds that the tuneful yellow-birds often
seized in the air.The rye had almost reached its height, and Johnnie
said it was "as good as going to the ocean to see it wave."At last the
swelling buds on the rose-bushes proclaimed the advent of June.CHAPTER XXXI

JUNE AND HONEY-BEES


It is said that there is no heaven anywhere for those incapable of
recognizing and enjoying it.Be this as it may, the month of June is a
segment of heaven annually bestowed on those whose eyes and ears have been
opened to beauty in sight and sound.Indeed, what sense in man is not
gratified to the point of imaginary perfection during this early fruition
of the varied promise of spring?Even to the sense of touch, how exquisite
is the "feel" of the fragrant rose-petals, the soft young foliage that has
transformed the world, and the queer downy fledglings in innumerable nests!To the eye informed by a heart in love with nature the longest days of the
year are all too short to note half that exists and takes place.Who sees
and distinguishes the varied blossoming of the many kinds of grain and
grasses that are waving in every field?And yet here is a beauty as
distinct and delicate as can be found in some of Mendelssohn's "Songs
without Words"--blossomings so odd, delicate, and evanescent as to suggest
a child's dream of a flower.Place them under a strong glass, and who can
fail to wonder at the miracles of form and color that are revealed?From
these tiny flowerets the scale runs upward until it touches the hybrid
rose.During this period, also, many of the forest trees emulate the wild
flowers at their feet until their inflorescence culminates in the white
cord-like fringe that foretells the spiny chestnut burrs.So much has been written comparing this exquisite season when spring
passes insensibly into summer with the fulfilled prophecy of girlhood,
that no attempt shall be made to repeat the simile.Amy's birthday should
have been in May, but it came early in June.May was still in her heart,
and might linger there indefinitely; but her mind, her thoughts, kept
pace with nature as unconsciously as the flowers that bloomed in their
season.There were little remembrances from all the family, but Webb's
gift promised the most pleasure.It was a powerful opera-glass; and as he
handed it to her on the piazza in the early morning he said:

"Our troupe are all here now, Amy, and I thought that you would like to
see the singers, and observe their costumes and expressions.Some birds
have a good deal of expression and a very charming manner while singing--a
manner much more to my taste than that of many a _prima donna_ whom I
have heard, although my taste may be uncultivated.Focus your glass on that
indigo-bird in yonder tree-top.Don't you see him?--the one that is
favoring us with such a lively strain, beginning with a repetition of
short, sprightly notes.The glass may enable you to see his markings
accurately."and it grows so deep and rich about
the head, throat, and breast!How plain I can see him, even to the black
velvet under his eyes!Why, I can look
right into his little throat, and almost imagine I see the notes he is
flinging abroad so vivaciously.I can even make out his claws closed on a
twig, and the dew on the leaves around him is like gems.Truly, Webb, you
were inspired when you thought of this gift.""Yes," he replied, quietly, looking much pleased, however, "with a very
honest wish to add to your enjoyment of the summer.I must confess, too,
that I had one thought at least for myself.You have described the
indigo-bird far more accurately than I could have done, although I have
seen it every summer as long as I can remember.You have taught me to
see; why should I not help you to see more when I can do it so easily?My
thought was that you would lend me the glass occasionally, so that I
might try to keep pace with you.I've been using the microscope too
much--prying into nature, as Burt would say, with the spirit of an
anatomist.""I shall value the glass a great deal more if you share it with me," she
said, simply, with a sincere, direct gaze into his eyes; "and be assured,
Webb," she added, earnestly, "you are helping me more than I can help
you.I'm not an artist, and never can be, but if I were I should want
something more than mere surface, however beautiful it might be.Think of
it, Webb, I'm eighteen to-day, and I know so little!You always make me
feel that there is so much to learn, and, what is more, that it is worth
knowing.You should have been a teacher, for you would make the children
feel, when learning their lessons, as Alf does when after game.she added, sweeping the scene with her
glass."I can go every day now on an exploring expedition.Clifford came in a little late, rubbing his hands felicitously, as he
said:

"I have just come from the apiary, and think we shall have another swarm
to-day.Did you ever hear the old saying, Amy,

  'A swarm of bees in June
   Is worth a silver spoon'?If one comes out to-day, and we hive it safely, we shall call it yours, and
you shall have the honey.""How much you are all doing to sweeten my life!"she said, laughing; "but I
never expected the present of a swarm of bees.I assure you it is a gift
that you will have to keep for me, and yet I should like to see how the
bees swarm, and how you hive them.I've heard that bees
are so wise, and know when people are afraid of them.""You can fix yourself up with a thick veil and a pair of gloves so that
there will be no danger, and your swarm of bees, when once in hive, will
take care of themselves, and help take care of you.That's the beauty of
bee-culture.""Our bees are literally in clover this year," Leonard remarked."That heavy
coating of wood-ashes that I gave to a half-acre near the apiary proved
most effective, and the plot now looks as if a flurry of snow had passed
over it, the white clover blossoms are so thick.That is something I could
never understand, Webb.Wood-ashes will always bring white clover.It's
hard to believe that it all comes from seed dormant in the ground.""Well, it does," was the reply."A great many think that the ashes simply produce conditions in the soil
which generate the clover."That would not be simple at all, and if any one could
prove it he would make a sensation in the scientific world.""Now, Len, here's your chance," laughed Burt."Just imagine what a halo of
glory you would get by setting the scientific world agape with wonder!""I could make the scientific world gape in a much easier way," Leonard
replied, dryly."Well, Amy, if you are as fond of honey as I am, you will
think a swarm of bees a very nice present.Fancy buckwheat cakes eaten with
honey made from buckwheat blossoms!There's a conjunction that gives to
winter an unflagging charm.If the old Hebrews felt as I do, a land flowing
with milk and honey must have been very alluring.Such a land the valley of
the Hudson certainly is.It's one of the finest grass regions of the world,
and grass means milk; and the extensive raspberry fields along its banks
mean honey.White clover is all very well, but I've noticed that when the
raspberry-bushes are in bloom they are alive with bees.I believe even the
locust-trees would be deserted for these insignificant little blossoms
that, like many plain people, are well worth close acquaintance.""The linden-tree, which also blooms this month," added Webb, "furnishes the
richest harvest for the honeybees, and I don't believe they would leave its
blossoms for any others.I wish there were more lindens in this region, for
they are as ornamental as they are useful.I've read that they are largely
cultivated in Russia for the sake of the bees.The honey made from the
linden or bass-wood blossoms is said to be crystal in its transparency, and
unsurpassed in delicacy of flavor."Clifford, "I shall look after the apiary to-day.That's
good lazy work for an old man.You can help me watch at a safe distance,
Amy, and protected, as I said, if they swarm.It wouldn't be well for you
to go too near the hives at first, you know," he added, in laughing
gallantry, "for they might mistake you for a flower.They are so well
acquainted with me that I raise neither expectations nor fears.You needn't
come out before ten o'clock, for they don't swarm until toward midday."With shy steps, and well protected, Amy approached the apiary, near which
the old gentleman was sitting in placid fearlessness under the shade of a
maple, the honey of whose spring blossoms was already in the hive.For a
time she kept at a most respectful distance, but, as the bees did not
notice her, she at last drew nearer, and removed her veil, and with the aid
of her glass saw the indefatigable workers coming in and going out with
such celerity that they seemed to be assuring each other that there were
tons of honey now to be had for the gathering.The bees grew into large
insects under her powerful lenses, and their forms and movements were very
distinct.Suddenly from the entrance of one hive near Mr.Clifford, which
she happened to be covering with her glass, she saw pouring out a perfect
torrent of bees.She started back in affright, but Mr.Clifford told her to
stand still, and she noted that he quietly kept his seat, while following
through his gold-rimmed spectacles the swirling, swaying stream that rushed
into the upper air.The combined hum smote the ear with its intensity.Each
bee was describing circles with almost the swiftness of light, and there
were such numbers that they formed a nebulous living mass.Involuntarily
she crouched down in the grass.In a few moments, however, she saw the
swarm draw together and cluster like a great black ball on a bough of a
small pear-tree.The queen had alighted, and all her subjects gathered
around her."Ah," chuckled the old gentleman, rising quietly, "they couldn't have been
more sensible if they had been human--not half so sensible in that case,
perhaps.I think you will have your swarm now without doubt.That's the
beauty of these Italian bees when they are kept pure: they are so quiet and
sensible.Come away now, until I return prepared to hive them."The young girl obeyed with alacrity, and was almost trembling with
excitement, to which fear as well as the novelty of the scene contributed
not a little.Clifford soon returned, well protected and prepared for
his work.Taking an empty hive, he placed it on the ground in a secluded
spot, and laid before its entrances a broad, smooth board.Then he mounted
a step-ladder, holding in his left hand a large tin pan, and gently brushed
the bees into it as if they had been inanimate things.A sheet had first
been spread beneath the pear-tree to catch those that did not fall into the
pan.Touched thus gently and carefully, the immense vitality of the swarm
remained dormant; but a rough, sudden movement would have transformed it
instantly into a vengeful cloud of insects, each animated by the one
impulse to use its stiletto.Corning down from the ladder he turned the pan
toward Amy, and with her glass she saw that it was nearly half full of a
crawling, seething mass that fairly made her shudder.But much experience
rendered the old gentleman confident, and he only smiled as he carried the
pan of bees to the empty hive, and poured them out on the board before it.The sheet was next gathered up and placed near the hive also, and then the
old gentleman backed slowly and quietly away until he had joined Amy, to
whom he said, "My part of the work is now done, and I think we shall soon
see them enter the hive."He was right, for within twenty minutes every bee
had disappeared within the new domicile."To-night I will place the hive on
the platform with the others, and to-morrow your bees will be at work for
you, Amy.I don't wonder you are so interested, for of all insects I think
bees take the palm.It is possible that the swarm will not fancy their new
quarters, and will come out again, but it is not probable.Screened by this
bush, you can watch in perfect safety;" and he left her well content, with
her glass fixed on the apiary.Having satisfied herself for the time with observing the workers coming and
going, she went around to the white clover-field to see the process of
gathering the honey.She had long since learned that bees while at work are
harmless, unless so cornered that they sting in self-defence.Sitting on a
rock at the edge of the clover-field, she listened to the drowsy monotone
of innumerable wings.Then she bent her glass on a clover head, and it grew
at once into a collection of little white tubes or jars in which from
earth, air, and dew nature distilled the nectar that the bees were
gathering.The intent workers stood on their heads and emptied these
fragrant honey-jars with marvellous quickness.They knew when they were
loaded, and in straight lines as geometrically true as the hexagon cells in
which the honey would be stored they darted to their hives.When the day
grew warm she returned to the house and read, with a wonder and delight
which no fairy tale had ever produced, John Burroughs's paper, "The
Pastoral Bees," which Webb had found for her before going to his work.To
her childish credulity fairy lore had been more interesting than wonderful,
but the instincts and habits of these children of nature touched on
mysteries that can never be solved.At dinner the experiences of the apiary were discussed, and Leonard asked,
"Do you think the old-fashioned custom of beating tin pans and blowing
horns influences a swarm to alight?The custom is still maintained by some
people in the vicinity.""It is no longer practiced by scientific
bee-keepers, and yet it is founded on the principle that anything which
disconcerts the bees may change their plans.It is said that water or dry
earth thrown into a whirling swarm will sometimes cause it to alight or
return to the hive.""Your speaking of blowing horns," said Mr.Clifford, laughing, "recalls a
hiving experience that occurred seventy years ago.I was a boy then, but
was so punctured with stings on a June day like this that a vivid
impression was made on my memory.A
neighbor, a quaint old man who lived very near, had gained the reputation
of an expert at this business.I can see him now, with his high stove-pipe
hat, and his gnarled, wrinkled visage, which he shrouded in a green veil
when hiving a swarm.He was a good-hearted old fellow, but very rough in
his talk.He had been to sea in early life, and profanity had become the
characteristic of his vernacular.Well, word came one morning that the bees
were swarming, and a minute later I aroused the old man, who was smoking
and dozing on his porch.I don't believe you ever ran faster, Alf, than I
did then.Hiving bees was the old fellow's hobby and pride, and he dived
into his cottage, smashing his clay pipe on the way, with the haste of an
attacked soldier seizing his weapons.In a moment he was out with all his
paraphernalia.To me was given a fish-horn of portentous size and sound.The'skips,' which were the old fashioned straw hives that the bears so
often emptied for our forefathers, stood in a large door-yard, over which
the swarm was circling.As we arrived on the scene the women were coming
from the house with tin pans, and nearly all the family were out-of-doors.It so happened that an old white horse was grazing in the yard, and at this
critical moment was near the end of the bench on which stood the hives.Coming up behind him, I thoughtlessly let off a terrific blast from my
horn, at which he, terrified, kicked viciously.Over went a straw skip, and
in a moment we had another swarm of bees on hand that we had not bargained
for.Dropping my horn, I covered my face with my arm, and ran for life to
the house, but I must have been stung twenty times before I escaped.The
bees seemed everywhere, and as mad as hornets.Although half wild with
pain, I had to laugh as I saw the old man frantically trying to adjust his
veil, meanwhile almost dancing in his anguish.In half a minute he
succumbed, and tore into a wood-shed.Everybody went to cover instantly
except the white horse, and he had nowhere to go, but galloped around the
yard as if possessed.This only made matters worse, for innocent as he was,
the bees justly regarded him as the cause of all the trouble.At last, in
his uncontrollable agony, he floundered over a stone wall, and disappeared.For an hour or two it was almost as much as one's life was worth to venture
out.The old man, shrouded and mittened, at last crept off homeward to
nurse his wounds and his wrath, and he made the air fairly sulphurous
around him with his oaths.But that kind of sulphuric treatment did not
affect the bees, for I observed from a window that at one point nearest the
skips he began to run, and he kept up a lively pace until within his door.What became of the swarm we expected to hive I do not know.That night we destroyed the irate swarm whose skip had
been kicked over, and peace was restored.""If you had told that story at the breakfast-table," said Amy, as soon as
the laugh caused by the old gentleman's account had subsided, "you could
never have induced me to be present this morning, even at such a respectful
distance.""An old man who lives not far from us has wonderful success with bees,"
Leonard remarked."He has over fifty hives in a space not more than twenty
feet square, and I do not think there is a tenth of an acre in his whole
lot, which is in the centre of a village.To this bare little plot his bees
bring honey from every side, so that for his purpose he practically owns
this entire region.He potters around them so much that, as far as he is
concerned, they are as docile as barn-door fowls, and he says he minds a
sting no more than a mosquito bite.There are half a dozen small trees and
bushes in his little yard, and his bees are so accommodating that they
rarely swarm elsewhere than on these low trees within a lew feet of the
skips.He also places mullein stalks on a pole, and the swarms often
cluster on them.He told me that on one day last summer he had ten swarms
to look after, and that he hived them all; and he says that his wife is as
good at the work as he is.On a pole which forms the corner of a little
poultry-coop he keeps the record of the swarms of each season, and for last
summer there are sixty-one notches.A year ago this month four swarms went
into a barrel that stood in a corner of his yard, and he left them there.By fall they had filled the barrel with honey, and then, in his vernacular,
he 'tuck it up'; that is, he killed the bees, and removed all the honey.""That is the regular bee-phrase in this region.If a hive is to be emptied
and the bees destroyed, or a bee tree to be cut down, the act is described
as 'taking up' the hive or tree," Burt explained."By the way, Amy," he
added, "we must give you a little bee-hunting experience in the mountains
next October.We can leave you with a
guard at some high point, when we strike a bee-line, and we might not be
long in finding the tree.""We'll put the expedition right down on the fall programme," she said,
smilingly.Clifford, she continued: "You spoke in
praise of Italian bees."Really only two distinct kinds--our native brownish-black bees, and the
Italians imported by Mr.S. B. Parsons and others about fifteen years ago.There is a cross or hybrid between these two kinds that are said to be so
ill-natured that it is unsafe to go anywhere near their hives.""Burt," said Webb, "you must remember reading in Virgil of the 'golden
bees.'""Yes, indistinctly; but none of them ever got in my bonnet or made much
impression.I don't like bees, nor do they like me.They respect only the
deliberation of profound gravity and wisdom.Father has these qualities by
the right of years, and Webb by nature, and their very presence soothes the
irascible insects; but when I go among them they fairly bristle with
stings.Give me a horse, and the more spirited the better.""Oh, no, Burt; can't give you any," said Leonard, with his humorous
twinkle."I'll sell you one, though, cheap.""Yes, that vicious, uncouth brute that you bought because so cheap.I told
you that you were'sold' at the same time with the horse.""I admit it," was the rueful reply."If he ever balks again as he did
to-day, I shall be tempted to shoot him."said Amy, a little petulantly, "I'd rather hear about Italian
bees than balky horses.Has my swarm of bees any connection with those that
Virgil wrote about, Webb?""They may be direct descendants," he replied."Then call them May-bees," laughed Burt."The kind of bees that Virgil wrote about were undoubtedly their
ancestors," resumed Webb, smiling at Burt's sally, "for bees seem to change
but little, if any, in their traits and habits.Centuries of domestication
do not make them domestic, and your swarm, if not hived, would have gone to
the mountains and lived in a hollow tree.I have a book that will give you
the history and characteristics of the Italians, if you would like to read
about them."My mind is on bees now, and I intend to follow them up
until I get stung probably.Well, I've enjoyed more honey this morning,
although I've not tasted any, than in all my life.You see how useful I
make the opera-glass, Webb.With it I can even gather honey that does not
cloy."CHAPTER XXXII

BURT BECOMES RATIONAL


Burt had expended more on his present for Amy than had any of the family,
and, while it had been acknowledged most cordially, he was a little
disappointed that his choice had not been so happy as Webb's.Therefore
after dinner he said: "I feel almost envious.I wish I could give you a
great deal of pleasure also to-day.How would you like to go in a row-boat
to Constitution Island, and make that visit to Miss Warner of which we
spoke last winter?It's warm, but not sultry, and we would keep in the
shadow of the mountains most of the way down.""Don't be afraid, Amy," he said, in a low tone."I'll go with you," she assented, cordially, "and I cannot think of
anything that would make my birthday more complete.""I'll be ready in an hour," he said, flushing with pleasure, and he went up
to his room two steps at a time.Burt's mental processes during the past few weeks had been characteristic,
and would have amused Amy had she been fully aware of them.As Webb
surmised, his fever had to run its course, but after its crisis had passed
he rapidly grew rational.Moreover, in his mother, and indeed in Amy
herself, he had the best of physicians.At first he was very penitent, and
not a little chagrined at his course.As days went by, however, and it was
not referred to by word or sign on the part of the family, his nervous
apprehension passed away.He thought he detected a peculiar twinkle in
Leonard's eyes occasionally, but it might have resulted from other causes.Still Amy did the most to reassure him both consciously and unconsciously.As she said, she took him at his word, and being unembarrassed by any
feeling of her own, found it easy to act like a sister toward him.This
naturally put him at his ease.In her floral expeditions with Johnnie,
however, and her bird-nestings with Alf, wherein no birds were robbed, she
unconsciously did more to reconcile him to the necessity of waiting than
could hours of argument from even his mother.She thus proved to him that
he had spoken much too soon--that she was not ready for his ill-chosen,
passionate words, which had wounded instead of firing her heart as he
intended they should.He now berated his stupidity, but consoled himself
with the thought that love is always a little blind.He saw that she liked
Webb exceedingly, and enjoyed talking with him, but he now was no longer
disposed to be jealous.She ever seemed to be asking questions like an
intelligent child."He is one of
the best fellows in the world, and she has found out that he's a walking
encyclopedia of out-door lore."Burt was not one to be depressed or to remain in the valley of humiliation
very long.After a week or two a slight feeling of superiority began to
assert itself.Amy was not only too young to understand him, but also,
perhaps, to appreciate him.He believed that he knew more than one pretty
girl to whom he would not have spoken in vain.Some day the scales would
fall from Amy's eyes.He could well afford to wait until they did, and he
threw back his handsome head at the thought, and an exultant flash came
into his blue eyes.Oh, he would be faithful, he would be magnanimous, and
he also admitted to himself that he would be very glad and grateful; but he
would be very patient, perhaps a little too much so to suit her.Since he
had been told to "wait," he would wait until her awakening heart
constrained her to give unequivocal signs of readiness to surrender.Thus his thoughts ran on while he was busy about the farm, or galloping
over the country on business or pleasure.After the corn-planting and the
rush of work in May was over, he had given himself a week's outing among
the trout streams of Ulster County, and had returned with his equanimity
quite restored.To assure Amy of this, and that she had nothing more to
fear, but everything to gain, was one of his motives in asking her to take
the long sail that afternoon.He succeeded so well that a smile of very
genuine satisfaction hovered about her lips more than once.She was grateful for the kind reception given her
by the authors who had done much to sweeten and purify the world's thought.She was charmed with the superb scenery as on their return they glided
along in the shadows of Cro' Nest, whose sides seemed lined with a choir of
wood and veery thrushes and other wild songsters.At last they evoked the
spirit of music in her.She took an oar with Burt, and they pulled, sang,
and laughed together like careless, happy children.Yet more than once she
shyly glanced at him, and queried, Could his flushed and mirthful face be
that of the passionate lover and blighted youth of scarce a month since?Burt said something droll, and her laugh raised a musical echo against the
steep rocks near.His wit was not its cause, but her own thought: "My plea
was that I was too young; he's very young, too."As they neared the point of Storm King the evening boat, the "Mary Powell,"
swept toward them with scarcely more apparent effort than that of a swan.A
few moments later their skiff was dancing over the swells, Amy waving her
handkerchief, and the good-natured pilot awakening a hundred echoes by his
steam-whistle of responsive courtesy.They were at home in time for supper, and here another delicious surprise
awaited Amy.Johnnie and Alf felt that they should do something in honor of
the day.From a sunny hillside they had gleaned a gill of wild
strawberries, and Webb had found that the heat of the day had so far
developed half a dozen Jacqueminot rosebuds that they were ready for
gathering.These with their fragrance and beauty were beside her plate in
dainty arrangement.They seemed to give the complete and final touch to the
day already replete with joy and kindness, and happy, grateful tears rushed
into the young girl's eyes.Dashing them brusquely away, she said: "I can't
tell you all what I feel, and I won't try.I want you to know, however,"
she added, smilingly, while her lips quivered, "that I am very much at
home."Burt was in exuberant spirits, for Amy had told him that she had enjoyed
every moment of the afternoon.This had been most evident, and the young
fellow congratulated himself.He could keep his word, he could be so jolly
a companion as to leave nothing to be desired, and waiting, after all,
would not be a martyrdom.His mood unloosed his tongue and made him
eloquent as he described his experiences in trout-fishing.His words were
so simple and vivid that he made his listeners hear the cool splash and see
the foam of the mountain brooks.They saw the shimmer of the speckled
beauties as they leaped for the fly, and felt the tingle of the rod as the
line suddenly tightened, and hear the hum of the reel as the fish darted
away in imagined safety.Burt saw his vantage--was not Amy listening with
intent eyes and glowing cheeks?--and he kept the little group in suspense
almost as long as it had taken him to play, land, and kill a three-pound
trout, the chief trophy of his excursion.Webb was unusually silent, and was conscious of a depression for which he
could not account.All was turning out better than he had predicted.The
relations between Burt and Amy were not only "serene," but were apparently
becoming decidedly blissful.The young girl was enthusiastic over her
enjoyment of the afternoon; there were no more delicately veiled defensive
tactics against Burt, and now her face was full of frank admiration of his
skill as an angler and of interest in the wild scenes described.Burt had
spent more time in society than over his books while at college, and was a
fluent, easy talker.Webb felt that he suffered in contrast, that he was
grave, heavy, dull, and old--no fit companion for the girl whose laughing
eyes so often rested on his brother's face and responded to his mirth.Perhaps Burt would not have long to wait; perhaps his rash, passionate
words had already given to Amy's girlish unconsciousness the shock that had
destroyed it, and she was learning that she was a woman who could return
love for love.Well, granting this, was it not just what they were all
expecting?"But the change is coming too soon," he complained to himself."I wish she could keep her gentle, lovable, yet unapproachable May-day
grace a little longer.Then she was like the wind-flower, which the eyes
can linger upon, but which fades almost the moment it is grasped.It made
her so different from other girls of her age.It identified her with the
elusive spirit of nature, whose beauty entrances one, but search and wander
where we will, nothing can be found that is distinctly and tangibly ours or
any one's.Amy, belonging definitely to any one, would lose half her
charm."Webb saw and heard all that passed, but in a minor key thoughts like these
were forming themselves with little volition on his part, and were symptoms
which as yet he did not understand.In an interval of mirth, Johnnie heard
footsteps on the piazza, and darting out, caught a glimpse of Mr.He had come on some errand, and, seeing the group at the
supper-table, had yielded to the impulse to depart unrecognized.This the
little girl would by no means permit.Since Easter an odd friendship had
sprung up between her and the lonely man, and she had become almost his
sole visitor.She now called after him, and in a moment was at his side."You must not go till I show you my
garden."Maggie joined them, for he deeply enlisted her sympathy, and she wished to
make it clear by her manner that the tie between him and the child had her
approval.Alvord," she said, "you must let Johnnie show
you her garden, and especially her <DW29>s.""Heart's-ease is another name for the flower, I believe," he replied, with
the glimmer of a smile."In that case Johnnie should be called <DW29>.Clifford, that you are willing to trust your child to a
stranger.We had a lovely ramble the other day, and she said that you told
her she might go with me.""I'm only too glad that you find Johnnie an agreeable little neighbor,"
Maggie began."Indeed, we all feel so neighborly that we hope you will soon
cease to think of yourself as a stranger."But here impatient Johnnie
dragged him off to see her garden, and his close and appreciative attention
to all she said and showed to him won the child's heart anew.Amy soon
joined them, and said:

"Mr.Alvord, I wish your congratulations, also.He turned, and looked at her so wistfully for a moment that her eyes fell."I do congratulate you," he said, in a low, deep voice."If I had my choice
between all the world and your age, I'd rather be eighteen again.May your
brow always be as serene as it is to-night, Miss Amy."His eyes passed
swiftly from the elder to the younger girl, the one almost as young at
heart and fully as innocent as the other, and then he spoke abruptly:
"Good-by, Johnnie.I wish to see your father a moment on some business;"
and he walked rapidly away.By the time they reached the house he had gone.Amy felt that with the night a darker shadow had fallen upon her happy day.The deep sadness of a wounded spirit touched her own, she scarcely knew
why.It was but the law of her unwarped, unselfish nature.Even as a happy
girl she could not pass by uncaring, on the other side.She felt that she
would like to talk with Webb, as she always did when anything troubled her;
but he, touched with something of Burt's old restlessness, had rambled away
in the moonlight, notwithstanding the fatigues of the day.Therefore she
went to the piano and sang for the old people some of the quaint songs of
which she knew they were fond.Burt sat smoking and listening on the piazza
in immeasurable content.CHAPTER XXXIII

WEBB'S ROSES AND ROMANCE


To Mrs.Clifford the month of June brought the halcyon days of the year.The warm sunshine revived her, the sub-acid of the strawberry seemed to
furnish the very tonic she needed, and the beauty that abounded on every
side, and that was daily brought to her couch, conferred a happiness that
few could understand.Long years of weakness, in which only her mind could
be active, had developed in the invalid a refinement scarcely possible to
those who must daily meet the practical questions of life, and whose more
robust natures could enjoy the material side of existence.It was not
strange, therefore, that country life had matured her native love of
flowers into almost a passion, which culminated in her intense enjoyment of
the rose in all its varieties.The family, aware of this marked preference,
rarely left her without these flowers at any season; but in June her eyes
feasted on their varied forms and colors, and she distinguished between her
favorites with all the zest and accuracy which a connoisseur of wines ever
brought to bear upon their delicate bouquet.With eyes shut she could name
from its perfume almost any rose with which she was familiar.Therefore, in
all the flower-beds and borders roses abounded, especially the
old-fashioned kinds, which are again finding a place in florists'
catalogues.Originally led by love for his mother, Webb, years since, had
begun to give attention to the queen of flowers.He soon found, however,
that the words of an English writer are true, "He who would have beautiful
roses in his garden must have them first in his heart," and there, with
queenly power, they soon enthroned themselves.In one corner of the garden,
which was protected on the north and west by a high stone wall, where the
soil was warm, loamy, and well drained, he made a little rose garden.He
bought treatises on the flower, and when he heard of or saw a variety that
was particularly fine he added it to his collection."Webb is marked with
my love of roses," his mother often said, with her low, pleased laugh.Amy
had observed that even in busiest times he often visited his rose garden as
if it contained pets that were never forgotten.He once laughingly remarked
that he "gave receptions there only by special invitation," and so she had
never seen the spot except from a distance.On the third morning after her birthday Amy came down very early.The bird
symphony had penetrated her open windows with such a jubilant resonance
that she had been awakened almost with the dawn.The air was so cool and
exhilarating, and there was such a wealth of dewy beauty on every side,
that she yielded to the impulse to go out and enjoy the most delightful
hour of the day.To her surprise, she saw Webb going down the path leading
to the garden."What's on your conscience," she cried, "that you can't
sleep?""The shame of leaving so many mornings like this unseen and not enjoyed.I
mean to repent and mend my ways from this time forth; that is, if I wake
up."Well, I did not know," she said, joining him, "but that you were going to
visit that _sanctum sanctorum_ of yours."Your virtue of early rising is about to be rewarded.You know when
some great personage is to be specially honored, he is given the freedom of
a city or library, etc.I shall now give you the freedom of my rose garden
for the rest of the summer, and from this time till frost you can always
find roses for your belt.I meant to do this on your birthday, but the buds
were not sufficiently forward this backward season."Oh, Webb, what miracles have you been working here?"she
exclaimed, as she passed through some screening shrubbery, and looked upon
a plot given up wholly to roses, many of which were open, more in the phase
of exquisite buds, while the majority were still closely wrapped in their
green calyxes.At the same time,
let me assure you that this small place is like a picture-gallery, and that
there is a chance here for as nice discrimination as there would be in a
cabinet full of works of art.There are few duplicate roses in this place,
and I have been years in selecting and winnowing this collection.They are
all named varieties, labelled in my mind.I love them too well, and am too
familiar with them, to hang disfiguring bits of wood upon them.Each one has been chosen and kept because of
some individual point of excellence, and you can gradually learn to
recognize these characteristics just as mother does.This plot here is
filled with hardy hybrid perpetuals, and that with tender tea-roses,
requiring very different treatment.Here is a moss that will bloom again in
the autumn.It has a sounding name--_Soupert-et-notting_--but it is
worthy of any name.Though not so mossy as some others, look at its fine
form and beautiful rose-color.Only one or two are out yet, but in a week
this bush will be a thing of beauty that one would certainly wish might
last forever.Nothing surpasses it unless it is _La
France_, over there."She inhaled the exquisite perfume in long breaths, and then looked around
at the budding beauty on every side, even to the stone walls that were
covered with climbing varieties.At last she turned to him with eyes that
were dilated as much with wonder as with pleasure, and said: "Well, this
_is_ a surprise.How in the world have you found time to bring all this
about?I never saw anything to equal it even in England.Of course I saw
rose gardens there on a larger scale in the parks and greenhouses, but I
have reference to the bushes and flowers.Why, Amy, an old gentleman who lives but a few
miles away has had seventy distinct kinds of hybrid perpetuals in bloom at
one time, and many of them the finest in existence; and yet he has but a
little mite of a garden, and has been a poor, hard-working man all his
life.Speaking of England, when I read of what the poor working people of
Nottingham accomplished in their little bits of glass-houses and their
Liliputian gardens, I know that all this is very ordinary, and within the
reach of almost any one who loves the flower.After one learns how to grow
roses, they do not cost much more care and trouble than a crop of onions or
cabbages.The soil and location here just suit the rose.You see that the
place is sheltered, and yet there are no trees near to shade them and drain
the ground of its richness.""Oh, you are sure to make it all seem simple and natural.It's a way you
have," she said, "But to me it's a miracle.I don't believe there are many
who have your feeling for this flower or your skill."The love for roses is very common, as it should
be, for millions of plants are sold annually, and the trade in them is
steadily increasing.Come, let me give you a lesson in the distinguishing
marks of the different kinds.A rose will smell as sweet by its own name as
by another, and you will find no scentless flowers here.There are some
fine odorless ones, like the Beauty of Stapleford, but I give them no
place."The moments flew by unheeded until an hour had passed, and then Webb,
looking at the sun, exclaimed: "I must go.This will answer for the first
lesson.You can bring mother here now in her garden chair whenever she
wishes to come, and I will give you other lessons, until you are a true
connoisseur in roses;" and he looked at those in her cheeks as if they were
more lovely than any to which he had been devoted for years."Well, Webb," she said, laughing, "I cannot think of anything lacking in my
morning's experience.I was wakened by the song of birds.You have revealed
to me the mystery of your sanctum, and that alone, you know, would be
happiness to the feminine soul.You have also introduced me to dozens of
your sweethearts, for you look at each rose as Burt does at the pretty
girls he meets.You have shown me your budding rose garden in the dewy
morning, and that was appropriate, too.Every one of your pets was gemmed
and jewelled for the occasion, and unrivalled musicians, cleverly concealed
in the trees near, have filled every moment with melody.Why should we not have them for
breakfast, also?""Why not, indeed, since it would seem that there are to be thousands here
and elsewhere in the garden?Fresh roses and strawberries for
breakfast--that's country life to perfection.He went away as if in a dream, and his heart almost ached with a tension of
feeling that he could not define.It seemed to him the culmination of all
that he had loved and enjoyed.His rose garden had been complete at this
season the year before, but now that Amy had entered it, the roses that she
had touched, admired, and kissed with lips that vied with their petals grew
tenfold more beautiful, and the spot seemed sacred to her alone.He could
never enter it again without thinking of her and seeing her lithe form
bending to favorites which hitherto he had only associated with his mother.His life seemed so full and his happiness so deep that he did not want to
think, and would not analyze according to his habit.He brought the strawberries to Amy in the breakfast-room, and stood near
while she and Johnnie hulled them.He saw the roses arranged by his
mother's plate in such nice harmony that one color did not destroy another.He replied to her mirthful words and rallyings, scarcely knowing what he
said, so deep was the feeling that oppressed him, so strong was his love
for that sweet sister who had come into his life and made it ideally
perfect.She appreciated what he had loved so fully, her very presence had
ever kindled his spirit, and while eager to learn and easily taught, how
truly she was teaching him a philosophy of life that seemed divine!The day passed in a confused maze of thought and
happiness, so strange and absorbing that he dared not speak lest he should
waken as from a dream.The girl had grown so beautiful to him that he
scarcely wished to look at her, and hastened through his meals that he
might be alone with his thoughts.The sun had sunk, and the moon was well
over the eastern mountains, before he visited the rose garden.Amy was
there, and she greeted him with a pretty petulance because he had not come
before.Then, in sudden compunction, she asked:

"Don't you feel well, Webb?You have been so quiet since we were here this
morning!Perhaps you are sorry you let me into this charmed seclusion.""No, Amy, I am not," he said, with an impetuosity very unusual in him."You
should know me better than even to imagine such a thing."Before he could say anything more, Burt's mellow voice rang out, "Amy!""Oh, I half forgot; I promised to take a drive with Burt this evening.Forgive me, Webb," she added, gently, "I only spoke in sport.I do know you
too well to imagine I am unwelcome here.No one ever had a kinder or more
patient brother than you have been to me;" and she clasped her hands upon
his arm, and looked up into his face with frank affection.His arm trembled under her touch, and he felt that he must be alone.In his
usual quiet tones, however, he was able to say: "You, rather, must forgive
me that I spoke so hastily.No; I'm not ill, but very tired.A good night's
rest will bring me around."Webb, you work too hard," she said, earnestly."But Burt is calling--"

"Yes; do not keep him waiting; and think of me," he added, laughing, "as
too weary for moonlight, roses, or anything but prosaic sleep.June is all
very well, but it brings a pile of work to a fellow like me.""Oh, Webb, what a clodhopper you're trying to make yourself out to be!Well, 'Sleep, sleep'--I can't think of the rest of the quotation.rang out her clear voice; and, with a smiling glance
backward, she hastened away.From the shrubbery he watched her pass up the wide garden path, the
moonlight giving an ethereal beauty to her slight form with its white,
close drapery.Then, deeply troubled, he threw himself on a rustic seat
near the wall, and buried his face in his hands.It was all growing too
clear to him now, and he found himself face to face with the conviction
that Amy was no longer his sister, but the woman he loved.The deep-hidden
current of feeling that had been gathering volume for months at last
flashed out into the light, and there could be no more disguise.The
explanation of her power over him was now given to his deepest
consciousness.By some law of his nature, when she spoke he had ever
listened; whatever she said and did had been invested with a nameless
charm.Day after day they had been together, and their lives had harmonized
like two chords that blend in one sweet sound.He had never had a sister,
and his growing interest in Amy had seemed the most natural thing in the
world; that Burt should love her, equally natural--to fall in love was
almost a habit with the mercurial young fellow when thrown into the society
of a pretty girl--and he had felt that he should be only too glad that his
brother had at last fixed his thoughts on one who would not be a stranger
to them.He now remembered that, while all this had been satisfactory to
reason, his heart for a long time had been uttering its low, half-conscious
protest.The events of this long day had revealed him unto
himself, because he was ripe for the knowledge.His nature had its hard, practical business side, but he had never been
content with questions of mere profit and loss.He not only had wanted the
corn, but the secret of the corn's growth and existence.To search into
Nature's hidden life, so that he could see through her outward forms the
mechanism back of all, and trace endless diversity to simple inexorable
laws, had been his pride and the promised solace of his life.His love of
the rose had been to him what it is to many another hard-working man and
woman--recreation, a habit, something for which he had developed the taste
and feeling of a connoisseur.It had had no appreciable influence on the
current of his thoughts.Amy's coming, however, had awakened the poetic
side of his temperament, and, while this had taken nothing from the old, it
had changed everything.Before, his life had been like nature in winter,
when all things are in hard, definite outline.The feeling which she had
inspired brought the transforming flowers and foliage.It was an immense
addition to that which already existed, and which formed the foundation for
it.For a long time he had exulted in this inflorescence of his life, as it
were, and was more than content.He did not know that the spirit gifted
even unconsciously with the power thus to develop his own nature must soon
become to him more than a cause of an effect, more than a sister upon whom
he could look with as tranquil eyes and even pulse in youth as in frosty
age.But now he knew it with the absolute certainty that was characteristic
of his mind when once it grasped a truth.The voice of Burt calling
"Amy," after the experiences of the day, had been like a shaft of light,
instantly revealing everything.For her sake more than his own he had
exerted himself to the utmost to conceal the truth of that moment of bitter
consciousness.He trembled as he thought of his blind, impetuous words and
her look of surprise; he grew cold with dread as he remembered how easily
he might have betrayed himself.what could he do but hide the truth with
sleepless vigilance?In the eyes
of Amy and all the family Burt was her acknowledged suitor, who, having
been brought to reason, was acting most rationally and honorably.Whether
Amy was learning to love him or not made no difference.If she, growing
conscious of her womanhood, was turning her thoughts to Burt as the one who
had first sought her, and who was now cheerfully waiting until the look of
shy choice and appeal came into her eyes, he could not seek to thrust his
younger brother aside.If the illustration of the rose which she had forced
into unnatural bloom was still true of her heart, he would be false to her
and himself, as well as to Burt, should he seek her in the guise of a
lover.He had felt that it was almost sacrilege to disturb her May-like
girlhood; that this child of nature should be left wholly to nature's
impulses and to nature's hour for awakening."If it only could have been, how rich and full life would be!""We were in sympathy at almost every point When shall I forget the hour
we spent here this morning!The exquisite purity and beauty of the dawn,
the roses with the dew upon them, seemed emblems of herself.Hereafter
they will ever speak to me of her.That perfume that comes on the breeze
to me now from the wild grapevine--the most delicate and delightful of
all the odors of June--is instantly associated with her in my mind, as
all things lovely in nature ever will be hereafter.How can I hide all
this from her, and seem merely her quiet elder brother?How can I meet
her here to-morrow morning, and in the witchery of summer evenings, and
still speak in measured tones, and look at her as I would at Johnnie?The
thing is impossible until I have gained a stronger self-control.I must
go away for a day or two, and I will.When I return neither Burt nor Amy
shall have cause to complain;" and he strode away.A firm to whom the Cliffords had been
sending part of their produce had not given full satisfaction, and Webb
announced his intention of going to the city in the morning to investigate
matters.His father and Leonard approved of his purpose, and when he added
that he might stay in town for two or three days, that he felt the need of
a little change and rest before haying and harvest began, they all
expressed their approval still more heartily.The night was so beautiful that Burt prolonged his drive.The witchery of
the romantic scenery through which he and Amy passed, and the loveliness of
her profile in the pale light, almost broke down his resolution, and once,
in accents much too tender, he said, "Oh, Amy, I am so happy when with
you!""I'm happy with you also," she replied, in brusque tones, "now that you
have become so sensible."He took the hint, and said, emphatically: "Don't you ever be apprehensive
or nervous when with me.I'll wait, and be'sensible,' as you express it,
till I'm gray."Her laugh rang out merrily, but she made no other reply.He was a little
nettled, and mentally vowed a constancy that would one day make her regret
that laugh.Webb had retired when Amy returned, and she learned of his plans from
Maggie."It's just the best thing he can do," she said, earnestly."Webb's
been overworking, and he needs and deserves a little rest."In the morning he seemed so busy with his preparations that he had scarcely
time to give her more than a genial off-hand greeting."Oh, Webb, I shall miss you so much!"she said, in parting, and her look
was very kind and wistful.He did not trust himself to speak, but gave her
a humorous and what seemed to her a half-incredulous smile.He puzzled her,
and she thought about him and his manner of the previous day and evening
not a little.With her sensitive nature, she could not approach so near the
mystery that he was striving to conceal without being vaguely impressed
that there was something unusual about him.The following day, however,
brought a cheerful, business-like letter to his father, which was read at
the dinner-table.He had straightened out matters in town and seemed to be
enjoying himself.She more than once admitted that she did miss him as she
would not any other member of the household.But her out-door life was very
full.By the aid of her glass she made the intimate acquaintance of her
favorite songsters.Clifford in her garden chair to
the rosary, and proposed through her instruction to give Webb a surprise
when he returned.She would prove to him that she could name his pets from
their fragrance, form, and color as well as he himself.CHAPTER XXXIV

A SHAM BATTLE AT WEST POINT


Burt did his best to keep things lively, and a few days after Webb's
departure said: "I've heard that there is to be a sham battle at West Point
this afternoon.The heavy guns from the river batteries had been awakening deep echoes
among the mountains every afternoon for some time past, reminding the
Cliffords that the June examinations were taking place at the Military
Academy, and that there was much of interest occurring near them.Not only
did Amy assent to Burt's proposition, but Leonard also resolved to go and
take Maggie and the children.In the afternoon a steam-yacht bore them and
many other excursionists to their destination, and they were soon skirting
the grassy plain on which the military evolutions were to take place.The scene was full of novelty and interest for Amy.Thousands of people
were there, representing every walk and condition of life.Plain farmers
with their wives and children, awkward country fellows with their
sweethearts, dapper clerks with bleached hands and faces, were passing to
and fro among ladies in Parisian toilets and with the unmistakable air of
the metropolis.There were officers with stars upon their shoulders, and
others, quite as important in their bearing, decorated with the insignia of
a second lieutenant.Plain-looking men were pointed out as senators, and
elegantly dressed men were, at a glance, seen to be nobodies.Scarcely a
type was wanting among those who came to see how the nation's wards were
drilled and prepared to defend the nation's honor and maintain peace at the
point of the bayonet.On the piazzas of the officers' quarters were groups
of favored people whose relations or distinguished claims were such as to
give them this advantage over those who must stand where they could to see
the pageant.The cadets in their gray uniforms were conspicuously absent,
but the band was upon the plain discoursing lively music.From the
inclosure within the barracks came the long roll of a drum, and all eyes
turned thitherward expectantly.Soon from under the arched sally-port two
companies of cadets were seen issuing on the double-quick.They crossed the
plain with the perfect time and precision of a single mechanism, and passed
down into a depression of the ground toward the river.After an interval
the other two companies came out in like manner, and halted on the plain
within a few hundred yards of this depression, their bayonets scintillating
in the unclouded afternoon sun.Both parties were accompanied by mounted
cadet officers.The body on the plain threw out pickets, stacked arms, and
lounged at their ease.Suddenly a shot was fired to the eastward, then
another, and in that direction the pickets were seen running in.With
marvellous celerity the loungers on the plain seized their muskets, formed
ranks, and faced toward the point from which the attack was threatened.A
skirmish line was thrown out, and this soon met a similar line advancing
from the depression, sloping eastward.Behind the skirmishers came a
compact line of battle, and it advanced steadily until within fair musket
range, when the firing became general.While the attacking party appeared
to fight resolutely, it was soon observed that they made no further effort
to advance, but sought only to occupy the attention of the party to which
they were opposed.The Cliffords stood on the northwestern edge of the plain near the statue
of General Sedgwick, and from this point they could also see what was
occurring in the depression toward the river."Turn, Amy, quick, and see
what's coming," cried Burt.Stealing up the hillside in solid column was
another body of cadets.A moment later they passed near on the
double-quick, went into battle formation on the run, and with loud shouts
charged the flank and rear of the cadets on the plain, who from the first
had sustained the attack.These seemed thrown into confusion, for they were
now between two fires.After a moment of apparent indecision they gave way
rapidly in seeming defeat and rout, and the two attacking parties drew
together in pursuit.When they had united, the pursued, who a moment before
had seemed a crowd of fugitives, became almost instantly a steady line of
battle.rang out, and, with fixed bayonets, they
rushed upon their assailants, and steadily drove them back over the plain,
and down into their original position.It was all carried out with a far
degree of life-like reality.The "sing" of minie bullets was wanting, but
abundance of noise and sulphurous smoke can be made with blank cartridges;
and as the party attacked plucked victory from seeming defeat, the people's
acclamations were loud and long.At this point the horse of one of the cadet officers became unmanageable.They had all observed this rider during the battle, admiring the manner in
which he restrained the vicious brute, but at last the animal's excitement
or fear became so great that he rushed toward the crowded sidewalk and road
in front of the officers' quarters.Burt had scarcely time to do more than encircle Amy with his arm and sweep
her out of the path of the terrified beast.The cadet made heroic efforts,
until it was evident that the horse would dash into the iron fence beyond
the road, and then the young fellow was off and on his feet with the
agility of a cat, but he still maintained his hold upon the bridle.A
second later there was a heavy thud heard above the screams of women and
children and the shouts of those vociferating advice.The horse fell
heavily in his recoil from the fence, and in a moment or two was led
limping and crestfallen away, while the cadet quietly returned to his
comrades on the plain.Johnnie and little Ned were crying from fright, and
both Amy and Maggie were pale and nervous; therefore Leonard led the way
out of the crowd.From a more distant point they saw the party beneath the
hill rally for a final and united charge, which this time proved
successful, and the companies on the plain, after a stubborn resistance,
were driven back to the barracks, and through the sally-port, followed by
their opponents.The clouds of smoke rolled away, the band struck up a
lively air, and the lines of people broke up into groups and streamed in
all directions.Leonard decided that it would be best for them to return by
the evening boat, and not wait for parade, since the little yacht would
certainly be overcrowded at a later hour.CHAPTER XXXV

CHASED BY A THUNDER-SHOWER


The first one on the "Powell" to greet them was Webb, returning from the
city.Amy thought he looked so thin as to appear almost haggard, but he
seemed in the best of spirits, and professed to feel well and rested.She
half imagined that she missed a certain gentleness in his words and manner
toward her, but when he heard how nearly she had been trampled upon, she
was abundantly satisfied by his look of deep affection and solicitude as he
said: "Heaven bless your strong, ready arm, Burt!""Oh, that it had been
mine!"He masked his feelings so well, however,
that all perplexity passed from her mind.She was eager to visit the rose
garden with him, and when there he praised her quickly acquired skill so
sincerely that her face flushed with pleasure.No one seemed to enjoy the
late but ample supper more than he, or to make greater havoc in the
well-heaped dish of strawberries."I tasted none like these in New York,"
he said."After all, give me the old-fashioned kind.We've tried many
varieties, but the Triomphe de Gand proves the most satisfactory, if one
will give it the attention it deserves.The fruit ripens early and lasts
till late.It is firm and good even in cool, wet weather, and positively
delicious after a sunny day like this.""I agree with you, Webb," said his mother, smiling."It's the best of all
the kinds we've had, except, perhaps, the President Wilder, but that
doesn't bear well in our garden.""Well, mother," he replied, with a laugh, "the best is not too good for
you.I have a row of Wilders, however, for your especial benefit, but
they're late, you know."The next morning he went into the haying with as much apparent zest as
Leonard.The growth had been so heavy that
in many places it had "lodged," or fallen, and it had to be cut with
scythes.Later on, the mowing-machine would be used in the timothy fields
and meadows.Amy, from her open window, watched him as he steadily bent to
the work, and she inhaled with pleasure the odors from the bleeding clover,
for it was the custom of the Cliffords to cut their grasses early, while
full of the native juices.Rakes followed the scythes speedily, and the
clover was piled up into compact little heaps, or "cocks," to sweat out its
moisture rather than yield it to the direct rays of the sun.said Amy, at the dinner-table, "my bees won't fare so well, now
that you are cutting down so much of their pasture.""Red clover affords no pasturage for honey-bees," said Webb, laughing."How
easily he seems to laugh of late!""They can't reach the honey
in the long, tube-like blossoms.Here the bumble-bees have everything their
way, and get it all except what is sipped by the humming-birds, with their
long beaks, as they feed on the minute insects within the flowers.I've
heard the question, Of what use are bumble-bees?--I like to say _bumble_
best, as I did when a boy.Well, I've been told that red clover cannot be
raised without this insect, which, passing from flower to flower, carries
the fertilizing pollen.In Australia the rats and the field mice were so
abundant that they destroyed these bees, which, as you know, make their
nests on the ground, and so cats had to be imported in order to give the
bumble-bees and red clover a chance for life.There is always trouble in
nature unless an equilibrium is kept up.Much as I dislike cats, I must
admit that they have contributed largely toward the prosperity of an
incipient empire.""When I was a boy," remarked Leonard, "I was cruel enough to catch
bumble-bees and pull them apart for the sake of the sac of honey they
carry."Alf hung his head, and looked very conscious."Well, I ain't any worse than papa," said the boy.All through the afternoon the musical sound of whetting the scythes with
the rifle rang out from time to time, and in the evening Leonard said, "If
this warm, dry weather holds till to-morrow night, we shall get in our
clover in perfect condition."On the afternoon of the following day the two-horse wagon, surmounted by
the hay-rack, went into the barn again and again with its fragrant burden;
but at last Amy was aroused from her book by a heavy vibration of thunder.Going to a window facing the west, she saw a threatening cloud that every
moment loomed vaster and darker.The great vapory heads, tipped with light,
towered rapidly, until at last the sun passed into a sudden eclipse that
was so deep as to create almost a twilight.As the cloud approached, there
was a low, distant, continuous sound, quite distinct from nearer and
heavier peals, which after brief and briefer intervals followed the
lightning gleams athwart the gloom.She saw that the hay-makers were
gathering the last of the clover, and raking, pitching, and loading with
eager haste, their forms looking almost shadowy in the distance and the dim
light.Their task was nearly completed, and the horses' heads were turned
barnward, when a flash of blinding intensity came, with an instantaneous
crash, that roared away to the eastward with deep reverberations.Amy
shuddered, and covered her face with her hands.When she looked again, the
clover-field and all that it contained seemed annihilated.The air was
thick with dust, straws, twigs, and foliage torn away, and the gust passed
over the house with a howl of fury scarcely less appalling than the
thunder-peal had been.Trembling, and almost faint with fear, sho strained
her eyes toward the point where she had last seen Webb loading the
hay-rack.The murky obscurity lightened up a little, and in a moment or two
she saw him whipping the horses into a gallop.The doors of the barn stood
open, and the rest of the workers had taken a cross-cut toward it, while
Mr.Clifford was on the piazza, shouting for them to hurry.Great drops
splashed against the window-panes, and the heavy, monotonous sound of the
coming torrent seemed to approach like the rush of a locomotive.Webb, with
the last load, is wheeling to the entrance of the barn.A second later, and
the horses' feet resound on the planks of the floor.Then all is hidden,
and the rain pours against the window like a cataract.In swift alternation
of feeling she clapped her hands in applause, and ran down to meet Mr.Clifford, who, with much effort, was shutting the door against the gale.When he turned he rubbed his hands and laughed as he said, "Well, I never
saw Webb chased so sharply by a thunder-shower before; but he won the race,
and the clover's safe."The storm soon thundered away to parts unknown, the setting sun spanning
its retreating murkiness with a magnificent bow; long before the rain
ceased the birds were exulting in jubilant chorus, and the air grew still
and deliciously cool and fragrant.When at last the full moon rose over the
Beacon Mountains there was not a cloud above the horizon, and Nature, in
all her shower-gemmed and June-clad loveliness, was like a radiant beauty
lost in revery.CHAPTER XXXVI

THE RESCUE OF A HOME


Who remembers when his childhood ceased?Who can name the hour when
buoyant, thoughtless, half-reckless youth felt the first sobering touch of
manhood, or recall the day when he passed over the summit of his life, and
faced the long decline of age?As imperceptibly do the seasons blend when
one passes and merges into another.There were traces of summer in May,
lingering evidences of spring far into June, and even in sultry July came
days in which the wind in the groves and the chirp of insects at night
foretold the autumn.The morning that followed the thunder-shower was one of warm, serene
beauty.The artillery of heaven had done no apparent injury.A rock may
have been riven in the mountains, a lonely tree splintered, but homes were
safe, the warm earth was watered, and the air purified.With the dawn Amy's
bees were out at work, gleaning the last sweets from the white clover, that
was on the wane, from the flowers of the garden, field, and forest.The
rose garden yielded no honey: the queen of flowers is visited by no bees.The sweetbrier, or eglantine, belonging to this family is an exception,
however, and if the sweets of these wild roses could be harvested, an Ariel
would not ask for daintier sustenance.White and delicate pink hues characterize the flowers of early spring.In
June the wild blossoms emulate the skies, and blue predominates.In July
and August many of the more sensitive in Flora's train blush crimson under
the direct gaze of the sun.Yellow hues hold their own throughout the year,
from the dandelions that first star the fields to the golden-rod that
flames until quenched by frost and late autumn storms.During the latter part of June the annual roses of the garden were in all
stages and conditions.Beautiful buds could be gleaned among the developing
seed receptacles and matured flowers that were casting their petals on
every breeze.The thrips and the disgusting rose-bug were also making havoc
here and there.But an untiring vigilance watched over the rose garden.Morning, noon, and evening Webb cut away the fading roses, and Amy soon
learned to aid him, for she saw that his mind was bent on maintaining the
roses in this little nook at the highest attainable point of perfection.It
is astonishing how greatly nature can be assisted and directed by a little
skilled labor at the right time.Left to themselves, the superb varieties
in the rose garden would have spent the remainder of the summer and autumn
chiefly in the development of seed-vessels, and in resting after their
first bloom.But the pruning-knife had been too busy among them, and the
thoroughly fertilized soil sent up supplies that must be disposed of.As
soon as the bushes had given what may be termed their first annual bloom
they were cut back halfway to the ground, and dormant buds were thus forced
into immediate growth.Meanwhile the new shoots that in spring had started
from the roots were already loaded with buds, and so, by a little
management and attention, the bloom would be maintained until frosty nights
should bring the sleep of winter.No rose-bug escaped Webb's vigilant
search, and the foliage was so often sprayed by a garden syringe with an
infusion of white hellebore that thrips and slugs met their deserved fate
before they had done any injury.Clifford and Amy was
maintained a supply of these exquisite flowers, which in a measure became a
part of their daily food.On every side was the fulfilment of its innumerable
promises.The bluebird, with the softness of June in his notes, had told
his love amid the snows and gales of March, and now, with unabated
constancy, and with all a father's solicitude, he was caring for his third
nestful of fledglings.Young orioles were essaying flight from their
wind-rocked cradles on the outer boughs of the elms.Phoebe-birds, with
nests beneath bridges over running streams, had, nevertheless, the skill to
land their young on the banks.Nature was like a vast nursery, and from
gardens, lawns, fields, and forest the cries and calls of feathered infancy
were heard all day, and sometimes in the darkness, as owls, hawks, and
other night prowlers added to the fearful sum of the world's tragedies.The
cat-birds, that had built in some shrubbery near the house, had by the last
of June done much to gain Amy's good-will and respect.As their domestic
character and operations could easily be observed, she had visited them
almost daily from the time they had laid the dry-twig and leafy foundation
of their nest until its lining of fine dry grasses was completed.She bad
found that, although inclined to mock and gibe at outsiders, they were
loyal and affectionate to each other.In their home-building, in the
incubation of the deep bluish-green eggs, and in the care of the young, now
almost ready to fly, they had been mutually helpful and considerate,
fearless and even fierce in attacking all who approached too near their
domicile.To Amy and her daily visits they had become quite reconciled,
even as she had grown interested in them, in spite of a certain lack of the
high breeding which characterized the thrushes and other favorites."My better acquaintance with them," she said one evening to Dr.Marvin,
who, with his wife, had stopped at the Cliffords' in passing, "has taught
me a lesson.I think I'm too much inclined to sweeping censure on the
exhibition of a few disagreeable traits.I've learned that the gossips in
yonder bushes have some excellent qualities, and I suppose you find that
this is true of the gossips among your patients.""Yes," replied the doctor, "but the human gossips draw the more largely on
one's charity; and if you knew how many pestiferous slugs and insects your
neighbors in the shrubbery have already destroyed, the human genus of
gossip would suffer still more in comparison."That Amy had become so interested in these out-door neighbors turned out to
their infinite advantage, for one morning their excited cries of alarm
secured her attention.Hastening to the locality of their nest, she looked
upon a scene that chilled the blood in her own veins.A huge black-snake
suspended his weight along the branches of the shrubbery with entire
confidence and ease, and was in the act of swallowing a fledgling that,
even as Amy looked, sent out its last despairing peep.The parent birds
were frantic with terror, and their anguish and fearless efforts to save
their young redeemed them forever in Amy's eyes.she cried, since, for some reason, he ever came first to her mind
in an emergency.It so happened that he had just come from the hay field to
rest awhile and prepare for dinner.In a moment he was at her side, and
followed with hasty glance her pointing finger."Come away, Amy," he said, as he looked at her pale face and dilated eyes."I do not wish you to witness a scene like that;" and almost by force he
drew her to the piazza.In a moment he was out with a breech-loading gun,
and as the smoke of the discharge lifted, she saw a writhing, sinuous form
fall heavily to the earth.After a brief inspection Webb came toward her in
smiling assurance, saying: "The wretch got only one of the little family.You have saved a home
from utter desolation.That, surely, will be a pleasant thing to remember.""What could I have done if you had not come?""I don't like to think of what you might have done--emulated the
mother-bird, perhaps, and flown at the enemy.""I did not know you were near when I called your name," she said."It was
entirely instinctive on my part; and I believe," she added, musingly,
looking with a child's directness into his eyes, "that one's instincts are
usually right; don't you?"He turned away to hide the feeling of intense pleasure caused by her words,
but only said, in a low voice, "I hope I may never fail you, Amy, when you
turn to me for help."Then he added, quickly, as if hastening away from
delicate ground: "While those large black-snakes are not poisonous, they
are ugly customers sometimes.I have read of an instance in which a boy put
his hand into the hole of a tree where there had been a bluebird's nest,
and touched the cold scales of one of these snakes.The boy took to his
heels, with the snake after him, and it is hard to say what would have
happened had not a man plowing near come to the rescue with a heavy
ox-whip.What I should fear most in your case would be a nervous shock had
the snake even approached you, for you looked as if you had inherited from
Mother Eve an unusual degree of hate for the reptile."The report of the gun had attracted Alf and others to the scene.Amy, with
a look of smiling confidence, said: "Perhaps you have rescued me as well as
the birds.I can't believe, though, that such a looking creature could have
tempted Eve to either good or evil;" and she entered the house, leaving him
in almost a friendly mood toward the cause of the cat-bird's woe.Alf exulted over the slain destroyer, and even Johnnie felt no compunction
at the violent termination of its life.The former, with much sportsmanlike
importance, measured it, and at the dinner-table announced its length to be
a little over four feet."By the way," said Webb, "your adventure, Amy, reminds me of one of the
finest descriptions I ever read;" and jumping up, he obtained from the
library Burroughs's account of a like scene and rescue."I will just give
you some glimpses of the picture," he said, reading the following
sentences: "'Three or four yards from me was the nest, beneath which, in
long festoons, rested a huge black-snake.I can conceive of nothing more
overpoweringly terrible to an unsuspecting family of birds than the sudden
appearance above their domicile of the head and neck of this arch enemy.One thinks of the great myth of the tempter and the cause of all our woe,
and wonders if the Arch-One is not playing off some of his pranks before
him.Whether we call it snake or devil matters little.I could but admire
his terrible beauty, however; his black, shining folds; his easy, gliding
movement--head erect, eyes glistening, tongue playing like subtile flame,
and the invisible means of his almost winged locomotion.Presently, as he
came gliding down the slender body of a leaning alder, his attention was
attracted by a slight movement of my arm; eying me an instant with that
crouching, utter, motionless gaze which I believe only snakes and devils
can assume, he turned quickly,'" etc.Clifford looked a little troubled that the scene in
Eden should be spoken of as merely a "myth."When she was a child "Paradise
Lost" had been her story-book, and the stories had become real to her.Burt, however, not to be outdone, recalled his classics."By the way," he said, "I can almost parallel your description from the
'Iliad' of Homer.I won't pretend that I can give you the Greek, and no
doubt it would be Greek to you.I'll get even with you, Webb, however, and
read an extract from Pope's translation," and he also made an excursion to
the library.Returning, he said, "Don't ask me for the connection," and
read:

  "'Straight to the tree his sanguine spires he rolled,
    And curled around in many a winding fold.The topmost branch a mother-bird possessed;
    Eight callow infants filled the mossy nest;
    Herself the ninth: the serpent as he hung
    Stretched his black jaws, and crashed the crying young:
    While hovering near, with miserable moan,
    The drooping mother wailed her children gone.The mother last, as round the nest she flew,
    Seized by the beating wing, the monster slew.'""I am now quite reconciled to your four years at
college.Heretofore I had thought you had passed through it as Shadrach,
Meshach, and Abednego passed through the fiery furnace, without even the
smell of fire upon their garments, but I now at last detect a genuine
Greek aroma.""I think Burt's quotation very pat," said Amy, "and I could not have
believed that anything written so long ago would apply so marvellously to
what I have seen to-day.""Marvellously pat, indeed," said Leonard."And since your quotation has
led to such a nice little pat on your classical back, Burt, you must feel
repaid for your long burning of the midnight oil."Burt flushed slightly, but he turned Leonard's shafts with smiling
assurance, and said: "Amply repaid.I have ever had an abiding confidence
that my education would be of use to me at some time."The long days grew hot, and often sultry, but the season brought
unremitting toil.The click of the mowing-machine, softened by distance,
came from field after field.As the grain in the rye grew plump and
heavy, the heads drooped more and more, and changed from a pale yellow to
the golden hue that announced the hour of harvest.In smooth and level
fields the reaping-machine also lightened and expedited labor, but there
was one upland <DW72> that was too rough for anything except the
old-fashioned cradle.On a breezy afternoon Amy went out to sketch the
harvesters, and from the shade of an adjacent tree to listen to the
rhythmical rush and rustle as the blade passed through the hollow stocks,
and the cradle dropped the gathered wealth in uniform lines.Almost
immediately the prostrate grain was transformed into tightly girthed
sheaves.How black Abram's great paw looked as he twisted a wisp of
straw, bound together the yellow stalks, and tucked under the end of his
improvised rope!Webb was leading the reapers, and they had to step quickly to keep pace
with him.As Amy appeared upon the scene he had done no more than take
off his hat and wave it to her, but as the men circled round the field
near her again, she saw that her acquaintance of the mountain cabin was
manfully bringing up the rear.Every time, before Lumley stooped to the
sweep of his cradle, she saw that he stole a glance toward her, and she
recognized him with cordial good-will.He, too, doffed his hat in
grateful homage, and as he paused a moment in his honest toil, and stood
erect, he unconsciously asserted the manhood that she had restored to
him.She caught his attitude, and he became the subject of her sketch.Rude and simple though it was, it would ever recall to her a pleasant
picture--the diminishing area of standing rye, golden in the afternoon
sunshine, with light billows running over it before the breeze, Webb
leading, with the strong, assured progress that would ever characterize
his steps through life, and poor Lumley, who had been wronged by
generations that had passed away, as well as by his own evil, following
in an honest emulation which she had evoked.CHAPTER XXXVII

A MIDNIGHT TEMPEST


As far as possible, the prudent Leonard, who was commander-in-chief of
the harvest campaign, had made everything snug before the Fourth of July,
which Alf ushered in with untimely patriotic fervor.Almost before the
first bird had taken its head from under its wing to look for the dawn,
he had fired a salute from a little brass cannon.Not very long afterward
the mountains up and down the river were echoing with the thunder of the
guns at West Point and Newburgh.The day bade fair to justify its
proverbial character for sultriness.Even in the early morning the air
was languid and the heat oppressive.The sun was but a few hours high
before the song of the birds almost ceased, with the exception of the
somewhat sleepy whistling of the orioles.They are half tropical in
nature as well as plumage, and their manner during the heat of the day is
like that of languid Southern beauties.They kept flitting here and there
through their leafy retirement in a mild form of restlessness, exchanging
soft notes--pretty nonsense, no doubt--which often terminated abruptly,
as if they had not energy enough to complete the brief strain attempted.Alf, with his Chinese crackers and his cannon, and Johnnie and Ned, with
their torpedoes, kept things lively during the forenoon, but their elders
were disposed to lounge and rest.The cherry-trees, laden with black and
white ox-hearts, were visited.One of the former variety was fairly
sombre with the abundance of its dark-hued fruit, and Amy's red lips grew
purple as Burt threw her down the largest and ripest from the topmost
boughs.Webb, carrying a little basket lined with grapevine leaves,
gleaned the long row of Antwerp raspberries.The first that ripen of this
kind are the finest and most delicious, and their strong aroma announced
his approach long before he reached the house.His favorite Triomphe de
Grand strawberries, that had supplied the table three weeks before, were
still yielding a fair amount of fruit, and his mother was never without
her dainty dish of pale red berries, to which the sun had been adding
sweetness with the advancing season until nature's combination left
nothing to be desired.By noon the heat was oppressive, and Alf and Ned were rolling on the
grass under a tree, quite satiated for a time with two elements of a
boy's elysium, fire-crackers and cherries.The family gathered in the
wide hall, through the open doors of which was a slight draught of air.All had donned their coolest costumes, and their talk was quite as
languid as the occasional notes and chirpings of the birds without.Amy
was reading a magazine in a very desultory way, her eyelids drooping over
every page before it was finished, Webb and Burt furtively admiring the
exquisite hues that the heat brought into her face, and the soft lustre
of her eyes.Clifford nodded over his newspaper until his
spectacles clattered to the floor, at which they all laughed, and asked
for the news.His invalid wife lay upon the sofa in dreamy, painless
repose.To her the time was like a long, quiet nooning by the wayside of
life, with all her loved band around her, and her large, dark eyes rested
on one and another in loving, lingering glances--each so different, yet
each so dear!Sensible Leonard was losing no time, but was audibly
resting in a great wooden rocking-chair at the further end of the hall.Maggie only, the presiding genius of the household, was not wilted by the
heat.She flitted in and out occasionally, looking almost girlish in her
white wrapper.She had the art of keeping house, of banishing dust and
disorder without becoming an embodiment of dishevelled disorder herself.No matter what she was doing, she always appeared trim and neat, and in
the lover-like expression of her husband's eyes, as they often followed
her, she had her reward.She was not deceived by the semi-torpid
condition of the household, and knew well what would be expected in a
Fourth-of-July dinner.The tinkle of the bell
at two o'clock awakened unusual animation, and then she had her triumph.Leonard beamed upon a hind-quarter of lamb roasted to the nicest turn of
brownness.A great dish of Champion-of-England pease, that supreme
product of the kitchen-garden, was one of the time-honored adjuncts,
while new potatoes, the first of which had been dug that day, had half
thrown off their mottled jackets in readiness for the feast.Nature had
been Maggie's handmaid in spreading that table, and art, with its
culinary mysteries and combinations, was conspicuously absent.If Eve had
had a kitchen range and the Garden of Eden to draw upon, Adam could
scarcely have fared better than did the Clifford household that day.The
dishes heaped with strawberries, raspberries, cherries, and white
grape-currants that had been gathered with the dew upon them might well
tempt the most _blase_ resident of a town to man's primal calling.Before they reached their iced tea, which on this hot day took the place
of coffee, there was a distant peal of thunder."I knew it would come," said old Mr."We shall have a cool
night, after all.""A Fourth rarely passes without showers," Leonard remarked."That's why I
was so strenuous about getting all our grass and grain that was down
under cover yesterday.""You are not the only prudent one," Maggie added, complacently."I've
made my currant jelly, and it jellied beautifully: it always does if I
make it before the Fourth and the showers that come about this time.It's
queer, but a rain on the currants after they are fairly ripe almost
spoils them for jelly."The anticipations raised by the extreme sultriness were fulfilled at
first only in part.Instead of a heavy shower accompanied by violent
gusts, there was a succession of tropical and vertical down-pourings,
with now and then a sharp flash and a rattling peal, but usually a heavy
monotone of thunder from bolts flying in the distance.One great cloud
did not sweep across the sky like a concentrated charge, leaving all
clear behind it, as is so often the case, but, as if from an immense
reserve, Nature appeared to send out her vapory forces by battalions.Instead of enjoying the long siesta which she had promised herself, Amy
spent the afternoon in watching the cloud scenery.A few miles southwest
of the house was a prominent highland that happened to be in the direct
line of the successive showers.This formed a sort of gauge of their
advance.A cloud would loom up behind it, darken it, obscure it until it
faded out even as a shadow; then the nearer spurs of the mountains would
be blotted out, and in eight or ten minutes even the barn and the
adjacent groves would be but dim outlines through the myriad rain-drops.The cloud would soon be well to the eastward, the dim landscape take form
and distinctness, and the distant highland appear again, only to be
obscured in like manner within the next half-hour.It was as if invisible
and Titanic gardeners were stepping across the country with their
watering-pots.Burt and Webb sat near Amy at the open window, the former chatting
easily, and often gayly.Webb, with his deep-set eyes fixed on the
clouds, was comparatively silent.At last he rose somewhat abruptly, and
was not seen again until evening, when he seemed to be in unusually good
spirits.As the dusk deepened he aided Alf and Johnnie in making the
finest possible display of their fireworks, and for half an hour the
excitement was intense.Leonard and
his father, remembering the hay and grain already stored in the barn,
congratulated each other that the recent showers had prevented all danger
from sparks.After the last rocket had run its brief, fiery course, Alf and Johnnie
were well content to go with Webb, Burt, and Amy to an upper room whose
windows looked out on Newburgh Bay and to the westward.Near and far,
from their own and the opposite side of the river, rockets were flaming
into the sky, and Roman candles sending up their globes of fire.But
Nature was having a celebration of her own, which so far surpassed
anything terrestrial that it soon won their entire attention.A great
black cloud that hung darkly in the west was the background for the
electric pyrotechnics.Against this obscurity the lightning played almost
every freak imaginable.At one moment there would be an immense
illumination, and the opaque cloud would become vivid gold.Again, across
its blackness a dozen fiery rills of light would burn their way in zigzag
channels, and not infrequently a forked bolt would blaze earthward.Accompanying these vivid and central effects were constant illuminations
of sheet lightning all round the horizon, and the night promised to be a
carnival of thunder-showers throughout the land.The extreme heat
continued, and was rendered far more oppressive by the humidity of the
atmosphere.The awful grandeur of the cloud scenery at last so oppressed Amy that she
sought relief in Maggie's lighted room.As we have already seen, her
sensitive organization was peculiarly affected by an atmosphere highly
charged with electricity.She was not re-assured, for Leonard inadvertently
remarked that it would take "a rousing old-fashioned storm to cool and
clear the air.""Why, Amy," exclaimed Maggie, "how pale you are!and your eyes shine as
if some of the lightning had got into them.""I wish it was morning," said the girl."Such a sight oppresses me like a
great foreboding of evil;" and, with a restlessness she could not
control, she went down to Mrs.Clifford
fanning the invalid, who was almost faint from the heat.Amy took his
place, and soon had the pleasure of seeing her charge drop off into quiet
slumber.Clifford was very weary also, Amy left them to their
rest, and went to the sitting-room, where Webb was reading.Burt had
fallen asleep on the lounge in the hall.Leonard's prediction promised to
come true.The thunder muttered nearer and nearer, but it was a sullen,
slow, remorseless approach through the absolute silence and darkness
without, and therefore was tenfold more trying to one nervously
apprehensive than a swift, gusty storm would have been in broad day.Webb looked up and greeted her with a smile.His lamp was shaded, and the
room shadowy, so that he did not note that Amy was troubled and
depressed."I am running over
Hawthorne's 'English Note-Books' again.""Yes," she said, in a low voice; and she sat down with her back to the
windows, through which shone momentarily the glare of the coming tempest.He had not read a page before a long, sullen peal rolled across the
entire arc of the sky."Webb," faltered Amy, and she rose and took an
irresolute step toward him.Never had he heard sweeter music
than that low appeal, to which the deep echoes in the mountains formed a
strange accompaniment.He stepped to her side, took her hand, and found
it cold and trembling.Drawing her within the radiance of the lamp, he
saw how pale she was, and that her eyes were dilated with nervous dread."Webb," she began again, "do you--do you think there is danger?""No, Amy," he said, gently; "there is no danger for you in God's
universe.""Webb," she whispered, "won't you stay up till the storm is over?And you
won't think me weak or silly either, will you?I
wish I had a little of your courage and strength.""I like you best as you are," he said; "and all my strength is yours when
you need it.I understand you, Amy, and well know you cannot help this
nervous dread.I saw how these electrical storms affected you last
February, and such experiences are not rare with finely organized
natures.See, I can explain it all with my matter-of-fact philosophy.But, believe me, there is no danger.She looked at him affectionately as she said, with a child's unconscious
frankness: "I don't know why it is, but I always feel safe when with you.I often used to wish that I had a brother, and imagine what he would be
to me; but I never dreamed that a brother could be so much to me as you
are.--Oh, Webb!"and she almost clung to him, as the heavy thunder pealed
nearer than before.Involuntarily he encircled her with his arm, and drew her closer to him
in the impulse of protection.She felt his arm tremble, and wholly
misinterpreted the cause.Springing aloof, she clasped her hands, and
looked around almost wildly."Oh, Webb," she cried, "there is danger.Webb was human, and had nerves also, but all the thunder that ever roared
could not affect them so powerfully as Amy's head bowed upon his
shoulder, and the appealing words of her absolute trust.He mastered
himself instantly, however, for he saw that he must be strong and calm in
order to sustain the trembling girl through one of Nature's most awful
moods.She was equally sensitive to the smiling beauty and the wrath of
the great mother.The latter phase was much the same to her as if a loved
face had suddenly become black with reckless passion.He took both her
hands in a firm grasp, and said: "Amy, I am not afraid, and you must not
be.Come," he added, in tones almost
authoritative, "sit here by me, and give me your hand.I shall read to
you in a voice as quiet and steady as you ever heard me use."She obeyed, and he kept his word.His strong, even grasp reassured her in
a way that excited her wonder, and the nervous paroxysm of fear began to
pass away.While she did not comprehend what he read, his tones and
expression had their influence.His voice, however, was soon drowned by
the howling of the tempest as it rushed upon them.He felt her hand
tremble again, and saw her look apprehensively toward the windows."Amy," he said, and in smiling confidence he fixed his eyes on hers and
held them.The house rocked in the
furious blasts.The uproar without was frightful, suggesting that the
Evil One was in very truth the "prince of the power of the air," and that
he was abroad with all his legions.Amy trembled violently, but Webb's
hand and eyes held hers.he said, cheerily; "the storm is
passing."A wan, grateful smile glimmered for a moment on her pale face, and then
her expression passed into one of horror.With a cry that was lost in a
deafening crash, she sprang into his arms.Even Webb was almost stunned
and blinded for a moment.Burt at last had
been aroused from the slumber of youth, and, fortunately for his peace,
rushed first into his mother's room.Webb thought Amy had fainted, and he
laid her gently on the lounge."Don't leave me," she gasped, faintly."Amy," he said, earnestly, "I assure you that all danger is now over.As
I told you once before, the centre of the storm has passed.Maggie and Burt now came running in, and Webb said, "Amy has had a faint
turn.This revived her speedily, but the truth of Webb's words proved more
efficacious.The gale was sweeping the storm from the sky.The swish of
the torrents mattered little, for the thunder-peals died away steadily to
the eastward.Amy made a great effort to rally, for she felt ashamed of
her weakness, and feared that the others would not interpret her as
charitably as Webb had done.In a few minutes he smilingly withdrew, and
went out on the rear porch with Leonard, whence they anxiously scanned
the barn and out-buildings.These were evidently safe, wherever the bolt
had fallen, and it must have struck near.In half an hour there was a
line of stars along the western horizon, and soon the repose within the
old house was as deep as that of nature without.He sat at his open window, and saw the clouds
roll away.But he felt that a cloud deeper and murkier than any that had
ever blackened the sky hung over his life.He knew too well why his arm
had trembled when for a moment it encircled Amy.The deepest and
strongest impulse of his soul was to protect her, and her instinctive
appeal to him had raised a tempest in his heart as wild as that which had
raged without.He felt that he could not yield her to another, not even
to his brother.It was to him she
turned and clung in her fears.And yet she had not even dreamed of his
untold wealth of love, and probably never would suspect it.He could not
reveal it--indeed, it must be the struggle of his life to hide it--and
she, while loving him as a brother, might easily drift into an engagement
and marriage with Burt.Could he be patient, and wear a smiling mask
through it all?That tropical night and its experiences taught him anew
that he had a human heart, with all its passionate cravings.When he came
down from his long vigil on the following morning his brow was as serene
as the scene without.Amy gave him a grateful and significant smile, and
he smiled back so naturally that observant Burt, who had been a little
uneasy over the events of the previous night, was wholly relieved of
anxiety.They had scarcely seated themselves at the breakfast-table
before Alf came running in, and said that an elm not a hundred yards from
the house had been splintered from the topmost branch to the roots.Clifford went out to look at the smitten tree, and they gazed
with awe at the deep furrow plowed in the blackened wood."It will live," said Webb, quietly, as he turned away; "it will probably
live out its natural life."Amy, in her deep sympathy, looked after him curiously.There was
something in his tone and manner which suggested a meaning beyond his
words.Not infrequently he had puzzled her of late, and this added to her
interest in him.Clifford saw in the shattered tree only reasons for profound
thankfulness, and words of Christian gratitude rose to his lips.CHAPTER XXXVIII

THE TWO LOVERS


The July sun speedily drank up the superabundant moisture, and the farm
operations went on with expedition.The corn grew green and strong, and
its leaves stretched up to Abram's shoulder as he ran the cultivator
through it for the last time.The moist sultriness of the Fourth finished
the ox-heart cherries.They decayed at once, to Alf's great regret."That
is the trouble with certain varieties of cherries," Webb remarked."One
shower will often spoil the entire crop even before it is ripe."But it
so happened that there were several trees of native or ungrafted fruit on
the place, and these supplied the children and the birds for many days
thereafter.The robins never ceased gorging themselves.Indeed, they were
degenerating into shameless _gourmands_, and losing the grace of
song, as were also the bobolinks in the meadows.Already there was a perceptible decline in the morning and evening
minstrelsy of all the birds, and, with the exception of calls and
twitterings, they grew more and more silent through the midday heat.With
the white bloom of the chestnut-trees the last trace of spring passed
away.Summer reached its supreme culmination, and days that would not be
amiss at the equator were often followed by nights of breathless
sultriness.Early in the month haying and harvest were over, and the last
load that came down the lane to the barn was ornamented with green
boughs, and hailed with acclamations by the farm hands, to whom a
generous supper was given, and something substantial also to take home to
their families.As the necessity for prompt action and severe labor passed, the Cliffords
proved that their rural life was not one of plodding, unredeemed toil.For the next few weeks Nature would give them a partial respite.She
would finish much of the work which they had begun.The corn would
mature, the oats ripen, without further intervention on their part.By
slow but sure alchemy the fierce suns would change the acid and bitter
juices in the apples, peaches, plums, and pears into nectar.Already Alf
was revelling in the harvest apples, which, under Maggie's culinary
magic, might tempt an ascetic to surfeit.While Burt had manfully done his part in the harvest-field, he had not
made as long hours as the others, and now was quite inclined to enjoy to
the utmost a season of comparative leisure.He was much with Amy, and she
took pleasure in his society, for, as she characterized his manner in her
thoughts, he had grown very sensible.He had accepted the situation, and
he gave himself not a little credit for his philosophical patience.He
regarded himself as committed to a deep and politic plan, in which,
however, there was no unworthy guile.He would make himself essential to
Amy's happiness.He would be so quietly and naturally devoted to her that
she would gradually come to look forward to a closer union as a matter of
course.He also made it clear to her that she had no rivals in his
thoughts, or even admiration, and, as far as courtesy permitted, withdrew
from the society of a few favorites who once had welcomed him gladly and
often.He had even pretended indifference to the advent of a dark-eyed
beauty to the neighborhood, and had made no efforts to form her
acquaintance.This stranger from the city was so charming, however, that
he had felt more than once that he was giving no slight proof of
constancy.His fleet horse Thunder was his great ally, and in the long
twilight evenings, he, with Amy, explored the country roads far and near.When the early mornings were not too warm they rowed upon the river, or
went up the Moodna Creek for water-lilies, which at that hour floated
upon the surface with their white petals all expanded--beautiful emblems
of natures essentially good.From mud and slime they developed purity and
fragrance.He was also teaching Amy to be an expert horsewoman, and they
promised themselves many a long ride when autumn coolness should make
such exercise more agreeable.Burt was a little surprised at his tranquil enjoyment of all this
companionship, but nevertheless prided himself upon it.He was not so
mercurial and impetuous as the others had believed him to be, but was
capable of a steady and undemonstrative devotion.Amy was worth winning
at any cost, and he proposed to lay such a patient siege that she could
not fail to become his.Indeed, with a disposition toward a little
retaliation, he designed to carry his patience so far as to wait until he
had seen more than once an expression in her eyes that invited warmer
words and manner.But he had to admit that time was passing, and that no
such expression appeared.This piqued him a little, and he felt that he
was not appreciated.The impression grew upon him that she was very
young--unaccountably young for one of her years.She enjoyed his bright
talk and merry ways with much the same spirit that Alf's boyish
exuberance called forth.She had the natural love of all young, healthful
natures for pleasure and change, and she unconsciously acted toward him
as if he were a kind, jolly brother who was doing much to give the spice
of variety to her life.At the same time her unawakened heart was
disposed to take his view of the future.Why should she not marry him,
after her girlhood had passed?All the family wished and expected it, and
surely she liked him exceedingly.But it would be time enough for such
thoughts years hence.He had the leisure and self-control for
good-comradeship, and without questioning she enjoyed it.Her life was
almost as free from care as that of the young birds that had begun their
existence in June.Only Webb perplexed and troubled her a little.At this season, when even
Leonard indulged in not a little leisure and rest, he was busy and
preoccupied.She could not say that he avoided her, and yet it seemed to
happen that they were not much together."I fear I'm too young and
girlish to be a companion for him," she sighed."His manner is just as
kind and gentle, but he treats me as if I were his very little sister.I
don't seem to have the power to interest him that I once had.I wish I
knew enough to talk to him as he would like;" and she stealthily tried to
read some of the scientific books that she saw him poring over.He, poor fellow, was engaged in the most difficult task ever given to
man--the ruling of his own spirit.He saw her sisterly solicitude and
goodwill, but could not respond in a manner as natural as her own.His best resource was the comparative
solitude of constant occupation.He was growing doubtful, however, as to
the result of his struggle, while Amy was daily becoming more lovely in
his eyes.Her English life had not destroyed the native talent of an
American girl to make herself attractive.She knew instinctively how to
dress, how to enhance the charms of which nature had not been chary, and
Webb's philosophy and science were no defence against her winsomeness.In
her changeful eyes lurked spells too mighty for him.Men of his caste
rarely succumb to a learned and aggressive woman.They require
intelligence, but it is a feminine intelligence, which supplements their
own, and is not akin to it.Webb saw in Amy all that his heart craved,
and he believed that he also saw her fulfilling Burt's hopes.She seemed
to be gradually learning that the light-hearted brother might bring into
her life all the sunshine and happiness she could desire.Webb
depreciated himself, and believed that he was too grave and dull to win
in any event more than the affection which she would naturally feel for
an elder brother, and this she already bestowed upon him frankly and
unstintedly.Burt took the same view, and was usually complacency itself,
although a week seemed a long time to him, and he sometimes felt that he
ought to be making more progress.He would be
faithful for years, and Amy could not fail to reward such constancy.CHAPTER XXXIX

BURT'S ADVENTURE


Not only had the little rustic cottages which had been placed on poles
here and there about the Clifford dwelling, and the empty tomato-cans
which Alf, at Dr.Marvin's suggestion, had fastened in the trees, been
occupied by wrens and bluebirds, but larger homes had been taken for the
summer by migrants from the city.Hargrove, a
wealthy gentleman, who had rented a pretty villa on the banks of the
Hudson, a mile or two away.Burt, with all his proposed lifelong
constancy, had speedily discovered that Mr.Hargrove had a very pretty
daughter.Of course, he was quite indifferent to the fact, but he could
no more meet a girl like Gertrude Hargrove and be unobservant than could
Amy pass a new and rare wildflower with unregarding eyes.Miss Hargrove
was not a wildflower, however.She was a product of city life, and was
perfectly aware of her unusual and exotic beauty.Admiring eyes had
followed her even from childhood, and no one better than she knew her
power.Her head had been quite turned by flattery, but there was a saving
clause in her nature--her heart.She was a belle, but not a cold-blooded
coquette.Admiration was like sunshine--a matter of course.She had
always been accustomed to it, as she had been to wealth, and neither had
spoiled her.Beneath all that was artificial, all that fashion prescribed
and society had taught, was the essential womanhood which alone can win
and retain a true man's homage.For reasons just the reverse of those
which explained Amy's indisposition to sentiment, she also had been kept
fancy-free.Seclusion and the companionship of her father, who had been
an invalid in his later years, had kept the former a child in many
respects, at a time when Miss Hargrove had her train of admirers.Miss
Gertrude enjoyed the train very much, but showed no disposition to permit
any one of its constituents to monopolize her.Indeed, their very numbers
had been her safety.Her attention had been divided and distracted by a
score of aspirants, and while in her girlish eyes some found more favor
than others, she was inclined to laughing criticism of them all.They
amused her immensely, and she puzzled them.Her almost velvety black
eyes, and the rich, varying tints of her clear brunette complexion,
suggested a nature that was not cold and unresponsive, yet many who would
gladly have won the heiress for her own sake found her as elusive as only
a woman of perfect tact and self-possession can be.She had no vulgar
ambition to count her victims who had committed themselves in words.With
her keen intuition and abundant experience she recognized the first
glance that was warmer than mere friendliness, and this was all the
committal she wished for.She loved the admiration of men, but was too
good-hearted a girl to wish to make them cynics in regard to women.She
also had the sense to know that it is a miserable triumph to lure a man
to the declaration of a supreme regard, and then in one moment change it
into contempt.While, therefore, she had refused many an offer, no one
had been humiliated, no one had been made to feel that he had been
unworthily trifled with.Thus she retained the respect and goodwill of
those to whom she might easily have become the embodiment of all that was
false and heartless.She had welcomed the comparative seclusion of the
villa on the Hudson, for, although not yet twenty, she was growing rather
weary of society and its exactions.Its pleasures had been tasted too
often, its burdens were beginning to be felt.She was a good horsewoman,
and was learning, under the instruction of a younger brother, to row as
easily and gracefully on the river as she danced in the ballroom, and she
found the former recreation more satisfactory, from its very novelty.Burt was well aware of these outdoor accomplishments.Any one inclined to
rural pleasures won his attention at once; and Miss Hargrove, as she
occasionally trotted smartly by him, or skimmed near on the waters of the
Hudson, was a figure sure to win from his eyes more than a careless
glance.Thus far, as has been intimated, he had kept aloof, but he had
observed her critically, and he found little to disapprove.She also was
observing him, and was quite as well endowed as he with the power of
forming a correct judgment.Men of almost every description had sought
her smiles, but he did not suffer by comparison.His tall, lithe figure
was instinct with manly grace.There was a fascinating trace of reckless
boldness in his blue eyes.He rode like a centaur, and at will made his
light boat, in which Amy was usually seated, cut through the water with
spray flying from its prow.In Miss Hargrove's present mood for rural
life she wished for his acquaintance, and was a little piqued that he had
not sought hers, since her father had opened the way.Hargrove, soon after his arrival in the neighborhood, had had
business transactions with the Cliffords, and had learned enough about
them to awaken a desire for social relations, and he had courteously
expressed his wishes.Maggie and Amy had fully intended compliance, but
the harvest had come, time had passed, and the initial call had not been
made.Leonard was averse to such formalities, and, for reasons already
explained, Burt and Webb were in no mood for them.They would not have
failed in neighborliness much longer, however, and a call was proposed
for the first comparatively cool day.A little incident now occurred
which quite broke the ice, and also somewhat disturbed Burt's serenity.Amy was not feeling very well, and he had gone out alone for a ride on
his superb black horse Thunder.In a shady road some miles away, where
the willows interlaced their branches overhead in a long, Gothic-like
arch, he saw Miss Hargrove, mounted also, coming slowly toward him.He
never forgot the picture she made under the rustic archway.Her fine
horse was pacing along with a stately tread, his neck curved under the
restraining bit, while she was evidently amusing herself by talking, for
the want of a better companion, to an immense Newfoundland dog that was
trotting at her side, and looking up to her in intelligent appreciation.Thus, in her preoccupation, Burt was permitted to draw comparatively
near, but as soon as she observed him it was evidently her intention to
pass rapidly.As she gave her horse the rein and he leaped forward, she
clutched his mane, and by a word brought him to a standstill.Burt saw
the trouble at once, for the girth of her saddle had broken, and hung
loosely down.Only by prompt action and good horsemanship had she kept
her seat.Now she was quite helpless, for an attempt to dismount would
cause the heavy saddle to turn, with unknown and awkward results.She had
recognized Burt, and knew that he was a gentleman; therefore she patted
her horse and quieted him, while the young man came promptly to her
assistance.He, secretly exulting over the promise of an adventure, said,
suavely, as he lifted his hat:

"Miss Hargrove, will you permit me to aid you?""Certainly," she replied, smiling so pleasantly that the words did not
seem ungracious; "I have no other resource."He bowed, leaped lightly to the ground, and fastened his horse by the
roadside; then came forward without the least embarrassment."Your
saddle-girth has broken," he said.You maintained your seat admirably, but a very slight
movement on your part will cause the saddle to turn.""I know that," she replied, laughing.I
am only anxious to reach ground in safety;" and she dropped the reins,
and held out her hands."Your horse is too high for you to dismount in that way," he said,
quietly, "and the saddle might fall after you and hurt you.Pardon me;"
and he encircled her with his right arm, and lifted her gently off.She blushed like the western sky, but he was so grave and apparently
solicitous, and his words had made his course seem so essential, that she
could not take offence.Indeed, he was now giving his whole attention to
the broken girth, and she could only await the result of his examination."I think I can mend it with a strap from my bridle so that it will hold
until you reach home," he said; "but I am sorry to say that I cannot make
it very secure.Clifford, I think," she began, hesitatingly.Clifford, and, believe me, I am wholly at your service.If you
had not been so good a horsewoman you might have met with a very serious
accident.""More thanks are due to you, I imagine," she replied; "though I suppose I
could have got off in some way.""There would have been no trouble in your getting off," he said, with one
of his frank, contagious smiles; "but then your horse might have run
away, or you would have had to lead him some distance, at least.Perhaps
it was well that the girth gave way when it did, for it would have broken
in a few moments more, in any event.Therefore I hope you will tolerate
one not wholly unknown to you, and permit me to be of service.""Indeed, I have only cause for thanks.I have interfered with your ride,
and am putting you to trouble.""I was only riding for pleasure, and as yet you have had all the
trouble."She did not look excessively annoyed, and in truth was enjoying the
adventure quite as much as he was, but she only said: "You have the
finest horse there I ever saw."I fear he would be ungallant."I should not be afraid so long as the saddle remained firm.At the sound of his name the beautiful animal arched his neck
and whinnied."There, be quiet, old fellow, and speak when you are spoken
to," Burt said."He is comparatively gentle with me, but uncontrollable
by others.I have now done my best, Miss Hargrove, and I think you may
mount in safety, if you are willing to walk your horse quietly home.But
I truly think I ought to accompany you, and I will do so gladly, with
your permission.""But it seems asking a great deal of-"

"Of a stranger?I wish I knew how to bring about a formal introduction.Will you not in the emergency defer the introduction
until we arrive at your home?""I think we may as well dispense with it altogether," she said, laughing."It would be too hollow a formality after the hour we must spend
together, since you think so slow a pace is essential to safety.Events,
not we, are to blame for all failures in etiquette.""I was coming to call upon you this very week with the ladies of our
house," he began."I assure you of the truth of what I say," he continued, earnestly,
turning his handsome eyes to hers.Then throwing his head back a little
proudly, he added, "Miss Hargrove, you must know that we are farmers, and
midsummer brings the harvest and unwonted labors."With a slight, piquant imitation of his manner, she said: "My father, you
must know, Mr.Clifford, is a merchant Is not that an equally respectable
calling?""Some people regard it as far more so."There is no higher rank than that of a
gentleman, Mr.He took off his hat, and said, laughingly: "I hope it is not presumption
to imagine a slight personal bearing in your remark.At least, let me
prove that I have some claim to the title by seeing you safely home.Put your foot in my hand, and bear your whole weight upon it,
and none upon the saddle.""You don't know how heavy I am.""No, but I know I can lift you.Without the least effort she found herself in the saddle."Yes," he replied, laughing; "I developed my muscle, if not my brains, at
college."In a moment he vaulted lightly upon his horse, that reared proudly, but,
at a word from his master, arched his neck and paced as quietly as Miss
Hargrove's better-trained animal.Burt's laugh would have thawed Mrs.He was so vital with youth and vigor, and his flow of
spirits so irresistible, that Miss Hargrove found her own nerves tingling
with pleasure.The episode was novel, unexpected, and promised so much
for the future, that in her delightful excitement she cast conventionality
to the winds, and yielded to his sportive mood.They had not gone a mile
together before one would have thought they had been acquainted for years.Burt's frank face was like the open page of a book, and the experienced
society girl saw nothing in it but abounding good-nature, and an enjoyment
as genuine as her own.She was on the alert for traces of provincialism and
rusticity, but was agreeably disappointed at their absence.He certainly
was unmarked, and, to her taste, unmarred, by the artificial mode of the
day, but there was nothing under-bred in his manner or language.He rather
fulfilled her ideal of the light-hearted student who had brought away the
air of the university without being oppressed by its learning.She saw,
with a curious little blending of pique and pleasure, that he was not in
the least afraid of her, and that, while claiming to be simply a farmer, he
unconsciously asserted by every word and glance that he was her equal.She
had the penetration to recognize from the start that she could not
patronize him in the slightest degree, that he was as high-spirited as he
was frank and easy in manner, and she could well imagine that his mirthful
eyes would flash with anger on slight provocation.She had never met just
such a type before, and every moment found her more and more interested and
amused.It must be admitted that his sensations kept pace with hers.Many had
found Miss Hargrove's eyes singularly effective under ordinary
circumstances, but now her mood gave them an unwonted lustre and power.Her color was high, her talk animated and piquant.Even an enemy, had she
had one, would have been forced to admit that she was dazzlingly
beautiful, and inflammable Burt could not be indifferent to her charms.He knew that he was not, but complacently assured himself that he was a
good judge in such matters.Hargrove met them at the door, and his daughter laughingly told him
of her mishap.She evidently reposed in him the utmost confidence.He
justified it by meeting her in like spirit with her own, and he
interpreted her unspoken wishes by so cordially pressing Burt to remain
to dinner that he was almost constrained to yield."You will be too late
for your own evening meal," he said, "and your kindness to my daughter
would be ill-requited, and our reputation for hospitality would suffer,
should we let you depart without taking salt with us.Burt was the last one to have any scruples on such grounds, and he
resolved to have his "lark" out, as he mentally characterized it.Hargrove had been something of a sportsman in his earlier days, and the
young fellow's talk was as interesting to him as it had been to Miss
Gertrude.Fred, her younger brother, was quite captivated, and elegant
Mrs.Hargrove, like her daughter, watched in vain for mannerisms to
criticise in the breezy youth.The evening was half gone before Burt
galloped homeward, smiling broadly to himself at the adventure.His absence had caused little remark in the family.It had been taken for
granted that he was at Dr.Marvin's or the parsonage, for the young
fellow was a great favorite with their pastor.When he entered the
sitting-room, however, there was a suppressed excitement in his manner
which suggested an unusual experience.He was not slow in relating all
that had happened, for the thought had occurred to him that it might be
good policy to awaken a little jealousy in Amy.In this effort he was
obliged to admit to himself that he failed signally.Even Webb's
searching eyes could not detect a trace of chagrin.She only seemed very
much amused, and was laughingly profuse in her congratulations to Burt.Moreover, she was genuinely interested in Miss Hargrove, and eager to
make her acquaintance."If she is as nice as you say, Burt," she
concluded, "she would make a pleasant addition to our little excursions
and pleasure parties.Perhaps she's old and bright enough to talk to
Webb, and draw him out of his learned preoccupation," she added, with a
shy glance toward the one who was growing too remote from her daily life.Even his bronzed face flushed, but he said, with a laugh: "She is evidently
much too bright for me, and would soon regard me as insufferably stupid.I
have never found much favor with city dames, or with dames of any
description, for that matter.""So much the worse for the dames, then," she replied, with a piquant nod
at him."Little sisters are apt to be partial judges--at least, one is," he said,
smilingly, as he left the room.He walked out in the moonlight, thinking:
"There was not a trace of jealousy in her face.Burt's perfect frankness was enough to prevent anything of the kind.If there had been cause for jealousy, he would have been reticent.Besides, Amy is too high-toned to yield readily to this vice, and Burt
can never be such an idiot as to endanger his prospects."A scheme, however, was maturing in Burt's busy brain that night, which he
thought would be a master-stroke of policy.He was quite aware of the
good impression that he had made on Miss Hargrove, and he determined that
Amy's wishes should be carried out in a sufficient degree at least to
prove to her that a city belle would not be wholly indifferent to his
attentions."I'll teach the coy little beauty that others are not so
blind as she is, and I imagine that, with Miss Hargrove's aid, I can
disturb her serenity a little before many weeks pass."CHAPTER XL

MISS HARGROVE


But a few days elapsed before Mr.Clifford, with Burt, Maggie, and Amy,
made the call which would naturally inaugurate an exchange of social
visits.Hargrove was especially interested in the old gentleman, and
they were at once deep in rural affairs.Maggie was a little reserved at
first with Mrs.Hargrove, but the latter, with all her stateliness, was a
zealous housekeeper, and so the two ladies were soon _en rapport._

The young people adjourned to the piazza, and their merry laughter and
animated talk proved that if there had been any constraint it was
vanishing rapidly.Amy was naturally a little shy at first, but Miss
Hargrove had the tact to put her guests immediately at ease.She proposed
to have a good time during the remainder of the summer, and saw in Burt a
means to that end, while she instinctively felt that she must propitiate
Amy in order to accomplish her purpose.Therefore she was disposed to pay
a little court to her on general principles.She had learned that the
young girl was a ward of Mr.What Burt was to Amy she did not
know, but was sure she could soon find out, and his manner had led to the
belief that he was not a committed and acknowledged lover.She made no
discoveries, however, for he was not one to display a real preference in
public, and indeed, in accordance with his scheme, she received his most
marked attentions.She could
not immediately accept of this genuine child of nature, whose very
simplicity was puzzling.It might be the perfection of well-bred reserve,
such complete art as to appear artless.Miss Hargrove had been in society
too long to take anything impulsively on trust.Still, she was charmed
with the young girl, and Amy was also genuinely pleased with her new
acquaintance.Before they parted a horseback ride was arranged, at Burt's
suggestion, for the next afternoon.This was followed by visits that soon
lost all formality, boating on the river, other rides, drives, and
excursions to points of interest throughout the region.Webb was
occasionally led to participate in these, but he usually had some excuse
for remaining at home.He, also, was a new type to Miss Hargrove,
"indigenous to the soil," she smilingly said to herself, "and a fine
growth too.With his grave face and ways he makes a splendid contrast to
his brother."She found him too reticent for good-fellowship, and he gave
her the impression also that he knew too much about that which was remote
from her life and interests.At the same time, with her riper experience,
she speedily divined his secret, to which Amy was blind."He could almost
say his prayers to Amy," she thought, as she returned after an evening
spent at the Cliffords', "and she doesn't know it."With all his frankness, Burt's relations to Amy still baffled her.She
sometimes thought she saw his eyes following the young girl with
lover-like fondness, and she also thought that he was a little more
pronounced in his attentions to her in Amy's absence.Acquaintanceship
ripened into intimacy as plans matured under the waning suns of July, and
the girls often spent the night together.Amy was soon beguiled into
giving her brief, simple history, omitting, of course, all reference to
Bart's passionate declaration and his subsequent expectations.As far as
she herself was concerned, she had no experiences of this character to
relate, and her nature was much too fine to gossip about Burt.Miss
Hargrove soon accepted Amy's perfect simplicity as a charming fact, and
while the young girl had all the refinement and intelligence of her city
friend, the absence of certain phases of experience made her companionship
all the more fascinating and refreshing.It was seen that she had grown
thus far in secluded and sheltered nooks, and the ignorance that resulted
was like morning dew upon a flower.Of one thing her friend thought herself
assured--Burt had never touched Amy's heart, and she was as unconscious of
herself as of Webb's well-hidden devotion.The Clifford family interested
Miss Gertrude exceedingly, and her innate goodness of heart was proved by
the fact that she soon became a favorite with Mr.She
never came to the house without bringing flowers to the latter--not only
beautiful exotics from the florists, but wreaths of clematis, bunches of
meadow-rue from her rambles, and water-lilies and cardinal-flowers from
boating excursions up the Moodna Creek--and the secluded invalid enjoyed
her brilliant beauty and piquant ways as if she had been a rare flower
herself.Burt had entered on his scheme with the deepest interest and with
confident expectations.As time passed, however, he found that he could
not pique Amy in the slightest degree; that she rather regarded his
interest in Miss Hargrove as the most natural thing in the world, because
she was so interesting.Therefore he at last just let himself drift, and
was content with the fact that the summer was passing delightfully.That
Miss Hargrove's dark eyes sometimes quickened his pulse strangely did not
trouble him; it had often been quickened before.When they were alone,
and she sang to him in her rich contralto, and he, at her request, added
his musical tenor, it seemed perfectly natural that he should bend over
her toward the notes in a way that was not the result of near-sightedness.Burt was amenable to other attractions than that of gravitation.Webb was the only one not blind to the drift of events.While he forbore
by word or sign to interfere, he felt that new elements were entering
into the problem of the future.He drove the farm and garden work along
with a tireless energy against which even Leonard remonstrated.But Webb
knew that his most wholesome antidote for suspense and trouble was work,
and good for all would come of his remedy.He toiled long hours in the
oat harvest.He sowed seed which promised a thousand bushels of turnips.Land foul with weeds, or only half subdued, he sowed with that best of
scavenger crops, buckwheat, which was to be plowed under as soon as in
blossom.The vegetable and fruit gardens gave him much occupation, also,
and the table fairly groaned under the over-abundant supply, while Abram
was almost daily despatched to the landing or to neighboring markets with
loads of various produce.The rose garden, however, seemed to afford Webb
his chief recreation and a place of rest, and the roses in Amy's belt
were the wonder and envy of all who saw them.His mother sometimes looked
at him curiously, as he still brought to her the finest specimens, and
one day she said: "Webb, I never knew even you to be so tireless before.You are growing very thin, and you are certainly going beyond your
strength, and--forgive me--you seem restlessly active.Have you any
trouble in which mother can help you?""You always help me, mother," he said, gently; "but I have no trouble
that requires your or any one's attention.I like to be busy, and there
is much to do.I am getting the work well along, so that I can take a
trip in August, and not leave too much for Leonard to look after."August came, and with it the promise of drought, but he and his elder
brother had provided against it.The young trees had been well mulched
while the ground was moist, and deep, thorough cultivation rendered the
crops safe unless the rainless period should be of long duration.Already in the rustling foliage there were whisperings of autumn.The
nights grew longer, and were filled with the sounds of insect life.The
robins disappeared from about the house, and were haunting distant
groves, becoming as wild as they had formerly been domestic.The season
of bird song was over for the year.The orioles whistled in a languid and
desultory way occasionally, and the smaller warblers sometimes gave
utterance to defective strains, but the leaders of the feathered chorus,
the thrushes, were silent.The flower-beds flamed with geraniums and
salvias, and were gay with gladioli, while Amy and Mrs.Clifford exulted
in the extent and variety of their finely quilled and rose-like asters
and dahlias.The foliage of the trees had gained its darkest hues, and
the days passed, one so like another that nature seemed to be taking a
summer siesta.CHAPTER XLI

A FIRE IN THE MOUNTAINS


A day in August can be as depressing as a typical one in May is
inspiring, or in June entrancing.As the season advanced Nature appeared
to be growing languid and faint.There was neither cloud by day nor dew
at night.The sun burned rather than vivified the earth, and the grass
and herbage withered and shrivelled before its unobstructed rays.The
foliage along the roadsides grew dun- from the dust, and those who
rode or drove on thoroughfares were stifled by the irritating clouds that
rose on the slightest provocation.Pleasure could be found only on the
unfrequented lanes that led to the mountains or ran along their bases.Even there trees that drew their sustenance from soil spread thinly on
the rocks were seen to be dying, their leaves not flushing with autumnal
tints, but hanging limp and bleached as if they had exhaled their vital
juices.The moss beneath them, that had been softer to the tread than a
Persian rug, crumbled into powder under the foot.Alf went to gather
huckleberries, but, except in moist and swampy places, found them
shrivelled on the bushes.Even the corn leaves began to roll on the
uplands, and Leonard shook his head despondingly.Webb's anxieties,
however, were of a far deeper character, and he was philosophical enough
to average the year's income.If the cows did come home hungry from their
pasture, there was abundance of hay and green-corn fodder to carry them
through until the skies should become more propitious.Besides, there was
an unfailing spring upon the place, and from this a large cask on wheels
was often filled, and was then drawn by one of the quiet farm-horses to
the best of the flower beds, the young trees, and to such products of the
garden as would repay for the expenditure of time and labor.The ground
was never sprinkled so that the morning sun of the following day would
drink up the moisture, but so deluged that the watering would answer for
several days.It was well known that partial watering does only harm.Nature can be greatly assisted at such times, but it must be in
accordance with her laws.The grapevine is a plant that can endure an
unusual degree of drought, and the fruit will be all the earlier and
sweeter for it.An excellent fertilizer for the grape is suds from the
laundry, and by filling a wide, shallow basin, hollowed out from the
earth around the stems, with this alkaline infusion, the vines were kept
in the best condition.The clusters of the earlier varieties were already
beginning to color, and the season insured the perfect ripening of those
fine old kinds, the Isabella and Catawba, that too often are frost-bitten
before they become fit for the table.Thus it would appear that Nature has compensations for her worst
moods--greater compensations than are thought of by many.Drought causes
the roots of plants and trees to strike deep, and so extends the range of
their feeding-ground, and anchors vegetation of all kinds more firmly in
the soil.Nevertheless, a long dry period is always depressing.The bright green
fades out of the landscape, the lawns and grass-plots become brown and
sear, the air loses its sweet, refreshing vitality, and is often so
charged with smoke from forest-fires, and impalpable dust, that
respiration is not agreeable.Apart from considerations of profit and
loss, the sympathy of the Clifford household was too deep with Nature to
permit the indifference of those whose garden is the market stall and the
florist's greenhouse, and to whom vistas in hotel parlors and piazzas are
the most attractive."It seems to me," Leonard remarked at the dinner-table one day, "that
droughts are steadily growing more serious and frequent.""While I remember a few in early life
that were more prolonged than any we have had of late years, they must
have resulted from exceptional causes, for we usually had an abundance of
rain, and did not suffer as we do now from violent alternations of
weather.There was one year when there was scarcely a drop of rain
throughout the summer.Potatoes planted in the late spring were found in
the autumn dry and unsprouted.But such seasons were exceedingly rare,
and now droughts are the rule.""And the people are chiefly to blame for them," said Webb."We are
suffering from the law of heredity.Our forefathers were compelled to
fell the trees to make room for the plow, and now one of the strongest
impulses of the average American is to cut down a tree.Our forests, on
which a moist climate so largely depends, are treated as if they
encumbered the ground.The smoke that we are breathing proves that fires
are ravaging to the north and west of us.They should be permitted no
more than a fire in the heart of a city.The future of the country
depends upon the people becoming sane on this subject.If we will send to
the Legislature pot-house politicans who are chiefly interested in
keeping up a supply of liquor instead of water, they should be provided
with a little primer giving the condition of lands denuded of their
forests.There is scarcely anything in their shifty ways, their blind
zeal for what the 'deestrict' wants to-day, regardless of coming days,
that so irritates me as their stupidity on this subject.A man who votes
against the protection of our forests is not fit for the office of
road-master.After all, the people are to blame, and their children will
pay dear for their ignorance and the spirit which finds expression in the
saying, 'After me the deluge'; and there will be flood and drought until
every foot of land not adapted to cultivation and pasturage is again
covered with trees.Indeed, a great deal of good land should be given up
to forests, for then what was cultivated would produce far more than
could be obtained from a treeless and therefore rainless country."cried Burt; "we must send you to the Legislature.""Primarily by instruction and the formation of public opinion.The
influence of trees on the climate should be taught in all our schools as
thoroughly as the multiplication-table.The national and state
governments would then be compelled to look beyond the next election, and
to appoint foresters who would have the same power to call out the people
to extinguish a forest fire that the sheriff has to collect his posse to
put down mob violence.In the long-run fire departments in our forest
tracts would be more useful than the same in cities, for, after all,
cities depend upon the country and its productiveness.The owners of
woodland should be taught the folly of cutting everything before them,
and of leaving the refuse brush to become like tinder.The smaller growth
should be left to mature, and the brush piled and burned in a way that
would not involve the destruction of every sprout and sapling over wide
areas.As it is, we are at the mercy of every careless boy, and such
vagrants as Lumley used to be before Amy woke him up.It is said--and
with truth at times, I fear--that the shiftless mountaineers occasionally
start the fires, for a fire means brief high-priced labor for them, and
afterward an abundance of whiskey."Events furnished a practical commentary on Webb's words.Miss Hargrove
had come over to spend the night with Amy, and to try some fine old
English glees that she had obtained from her city home.They had just
adjourned from the supper-table to the piazza when Lumley appeared, hat
in hand.He spoke to Leonard, but looked at Amy with a kind of wondering
admiration, as if he could not believe that the girl, who looked so fair
and delicate in her evening dress, so remote from him and his
surroundings, could ever have given him her hand, and spoken as if their
humanity had anything in common.The Cliffords were informed that a fire had broken out on a tract
adjoining their own."City chaps was up there gunning out o' season,"
Lumley explained, "and wads from their guns must 'a started it."As there was much wood ranked on the Clifford tract, the matter was
serious.Abram and other farm-hands were summoned, and the brothers acted
as did the minute-men in the Revolution when the enemy appeared in their
vicinity.The young men excused themselves, and bustle and confusion
followed.Burt, with a flannel blouse belted tightly around his waist,
soon dashed up to the front piazza on his horse, and, flourishing a rake,
said, laughingly, "I don't look much like a knight sallying forth to
battle-do I?""You look as if you could be one if the occasion arose," Miss Hargrove
replied.During the half-jesting badinage that followed Amy stole away.Behind the
house Webb was preparing to mount, when a light hand fell on his
shoulder."You don't seem
to spare yourself in anything.I dread to have you go up into those
darkening mountains.""Why, Amy," he replied, laughing, "one would think I was going to fight
Indians, and you feared for my scalp.""I am not so young and blind but that I can see that you are quietly half
reckless with yourself," she replied; and her tone indicated that she was
a little hurt."I pledge you my word that I will not be reckless tonight; and, after
all, this is but disagreeable, humdrum work that we often have to do.Burt will be there to watch over me, you
know," he added."Oh, he's talking romantic nonsense to Miss Hargrove.I wish I was as sure of you, and I wish I had more influence
over you.I'm not such a very little sister, even if I don't know enough
to talk to you as you would like;" and she left him abruptly.He mastered a powerful impulse to spring from his horse and call her
back.A moment's thought taught him, however, that he could not trust
himself then to say a word, and he rode rapidly away."That is the best chance for us
both, unless--" But he hesitated to put into words the half-formed hope
that Miss Hargrove's appearance in the little drama of their lives might
change its final scenes."She's jealous of her friend, at last," he
concluded, and this conviction gave him little comfort.Burt soon
overtook him, and their ride was comparatively silent, for each was busy
with his own thoughts.Lumley was directed to join them at the fire, and
then was forgotten by all except Amy, who, by a gentle urgency, induced
him to go to the kitchen and get a good supper.Before he departed she
slipped a banknote into his hand with which to buy a dress for the baby.Lumley had to pass more than one groggery on his way to the mountains,
but the money was as safe in his pocket as it would have been in Amy's.he soliloquized, as he hastened
through the gathering darkness with his long, swinging stride."I didn't
know there was sich gells.She's never lectured me once, but she jest
smiles and looks a feller into bein' a man."Miss Hargrove had noted Amy's influence over the mountaineer, and she
asked for an explanation.Amy, in a very brief, modest way, told of her
visits to the wretched cabin, and said, in conclusion: "I feel sorry for
poor Lumley.The fact that he is trying to do better, with so much
against him, proves what he might have been.That's one of the things
that trouble me most, as I begin to think and see a little of life; so
many people have no chance worth speaking of.""The thing that ought to trouble me most is, I suppose, that those who
have a chance do so little for such people.Amy," she added, sadly, after
a moment's thought, "I've had many triumphs over men, but none like
yours; and I feel to-night as if I could give them all to see a man look
at me as that poor fellow looked at you.It was the grateful homage of a
human soul to whom you had given something that in a dim way was felt to
be priceless.The best that I can remember in my pleasure-loving life is
that I have not permitted myself selfishly and recklessly to destroy
manhood, but I fear no one is the better for having known me.""You do yourself injustice," said Amy, warmly."I'm the better and
happier for having known you.Papa had a morbid horror of fashionable
society, and this accounts for my being so unsophisticated.With all your
experience of such society, I have perfect faith in you, and could trust
you implicitly."(and Amy thought she had never seen such
depth and power in human eyes as in those of Miss Hargrove, who encircled
the young girl with her arm, and looked as if seeking to detect the
faintest doubt)."Yes," said Amy, with quiet emphasis.Miss Hargrove drew a long breath, and then said: "That little word may do
me more good than all the sermons I ever heard.Many would try to be
different if others had more faith in them.I think that is the secret of
your power over the rough man that has just gone.You recognized the good
that was in him, and made him conscious of it.Well, I must try to
deserve your trust."Then she stepped out on the dusky piazza, and
sighed, as she thought: "It may cost me dear.She seemed troubled at my
words to Burt, and stole away as if she were the awkward third person.I
may have misjudged her, and she cares for him after all."Amy went to the piano, and played softly until summoned without by an
excited exclamation from her friend.A line of fire was creeping toward
them around a lofty highland, and it grew each moment more and more
distinct."Oh, I know from its position that it's drawing near our
tract," cried Amy."If it is so bright to us at this distance, it must be
almost terrible to those near by.I suppose they are all up there just in
front of it, and Burt is so reckless."She was about to say Webb, but,
because of some unrecognized impulse, she did not.The utterance of
Burt's name, however, was not lost on Miss Hargrove.For a long time the girls watched the scene with awe, and each, in
imagination, saw an athletic figure begrimed with smoke, and sending out
grotesque shadows into the obscurity, as the destroying element was met
and fought in ways unknown to them, which, they felt sure, involved
danger.Miss Hargrove feared that they both had the same form in mind.She was not a girl to remain long unconscious of her heart's inclinations,
and she knew that Burt Clifford had quickened her pulses as no man had ever
done before.This very fact made her less judicial, less keen, in her
insight.If he was so attractive to her, could Amy be indifferent to him
after months of companionship?She had thought that she understood Amy
thoroughly, but was beginning to lose faith in her impression.While in
some respects Amy was still a child, there were quiet depths in her nature
of which the young girl herself was but half conscious.She often lapsed
into long reveries.Never had he been more
fraternal in his manner, but apparently she was losing her power to
interest him, to lure him away from the material side of life."I can't
keep pace with him," she sighed; "and now that he has learned all about my
little range of thoughts and knowledge, he finds that I can be scarcely
more to him than Johnnie, whom he pets in much the same spirit that he does
me, and then goes to his work or books and forgets us both.He could help
me so much, if he only thought it worth his while!I'm sure I'm not
contented to be ignorant, and many of the things that he knows so much
about interest me most."Thus each girl was busy with her thoughts, as they sat in the warm summer
night and watched the vivid line draw nearer.Clifford and Maggie
came out from time to time, and were evidently disturbed by the unchecked
progress of the fire.Alf had gone with his father, and anything like a
conflagration so terrified Johnnie that she dared not leave her mother's
lighted room.Suddenly the approaching line grew dim, was broken, and before very long
even the last red glow disappeared utterly.Clifford,
rubbing his hands, "they have got the fire under, and I don't believe it
reached oar tract.""How did they put it out so suddenly?""Were they
not fighting it all the time?""The boys will soon be here, and they can give you a more graphic account
than I. Mother is a little excited and troubled, as she always is when
her great babies are away on such affairs, so I must ask you to excuse
me."In little more than half an hour a swift gallop was heard, and Burt soon
appeared, in the light of the late-rising moon."It's all out," he
exclaimed."Leonard and Webb propose remaining an hour or two longer, to
see that it does not break out again.There's no need of their doing so,
for Lumley promised to watch till morning.If
you'll wait till I put on a little of the aspect of a white man, I'll
join you."He had been conscious of a feverish impatience to get back to
the ladies, having carefully, even in his thoughts, employed the plural,
and he had feared that they might have retired.Miss Hargrove exclaimed: "How absurd!You wish to go and divest yourself
of all picturesqueness!I've seen well-dressed men before, and would much
prefer that you should join us as you are.We can then imagine that you
are a bandit or a frontiersman, and that your rake was a rifle, which you
had used against the Indians.We are impatient to have you tell us how
you fought the fire."He gave but scant attention to Thunder that night, and soon stepped out
on the moonlit piazza, his tall, fine figure outlined to perfection in
his close-fitting costume."You will, indeed, need all your imagination to make anything of our task
to-night," he said."Fighting a mountain fire is the most prosaic of hard
work.Suppose the line of fire coming down toward me from where you are
sitting."As yet unknown to him, a certain subtile flame was originating
in that direction."We simply begin well in advance of it, so that we may
have time to rake a space, extending along the whole front of the fire,
clear of leaves and rubbish, and as far as possible to hollow out with
hoes a trench through this space.Thus, when the fire comes to this
cleared area, there is nothing to burn, and it goes out for want of fuel.Of course, it's rough work, and it must be done rapidly, but you can see
that all the heroic elements which you may have associated with our
expedition are utterly lacking."Amy and I have had our little romance, and have
imagined you charging the line of fire in imminent danger of being
strangled with smoke, if nothing worse."Amy soon heard Maggie bustling about, preparing a midnight lunch for
those who would come home hungry as well as weary, and she said that she
would go and try to help.To Burt this seemed sufficient reason for her
absence, but Miss Hargrove thought, "Perhaps she saw that his eyes were
fixed chiefly on me as he gave his description.I wish I knew just how
she feels toward him!"But the temptation to remain in the witching moonlight was too strong to
be resisted.His mellow tones were a music that she had never heard
before, and her eyes grew lustrous with suppressed feeling, and a
happiness to which she was not sure she was entitled.The spell of her
beauty was on him also, and the moments flew by unheeded, until Amy was
heard playing and singing softly to herself.was Miss Hargrove's mental comment, and with not a little
compunction she rose and went into the parlor.Burt lighted a cigar, in
the hope that the girls would again join him, but Leonard, Webb, and Alf
returned sooner than they were expected, and all speedily sat down to
their unseasonable repast.To Amy's surprise, Webb was the liveliest of
the party, but he looked gaunt from fatigue--so worn, indeed, that he
reminded her of the time when he had returned from Burt's rescue.But
there was no such episode as had then occurred before they parted for the
night, and to this she now looked back wistfully.He rose before the
others, pleaded fatigue, and went to his room.CHAPTER XLII

CAMPING OUT


They all gathered at a late breakfast, and the surface current of family
and social life sparkled as if there were no hidden depths and secret
thoughts.Amy's manner was not cold toward Webb, but her pride was
touched, and her feelings were a little hurt.While disposed to blame
herself only that she had not the power to interest him and secure his
companionship, as in the past, it was not in human nature to receive with
indifference such an apparent hint that he was far beyond her."It would
be more generous in Webb to help than to ignore me because I know so
little," she thought."Very well: I can have a good time with Burt and
Gertrude until Webb gets over his hurry and preoccupation;" and with a
slight spirit of retaliation she acted as if she thoroughly enjoyed
Burt's lively talk.The young fellow soon made a proposition that caused a general and breezy
excitement."There never was a better time than this for camping out," he
said."The ground is dry, and there is scarcely any dew.Suppose we go up and spend a few days on our mountain
tract?Maggie could chaperon the party, and I've no doubt that Dr.How could she leave the old people and her housekeeping?Clifford, however, became the strongest advocates of the scheme.They
could get along with the servants, they said, and a little outing would
do Maggie good.Leonard, who had listened in comparative silence, brought
his wife to a decision by saying: "You had better go, Maggie.You will
have all the housekeeping you want on the mountain, and I will go back
and forth every day and see that all's right.It's not as if you were
beyond the reach of home, for you could be here in an hour were there
need.Come now, make up your mind for a regular lark.The children were wild with delight at the prospect, and Miss Hargrove
and Amy scarcely less pleased.The latter had furtively watched Webb, who
at first could not disguise a little perplexity and trouble at the
prospect.But he had thought rapidly, and felt that a refusal to be one
of the party might cause embarrassing surmises.Therefore he also soon
became zealous in his advocacy of the plan.He felt that circumstances
were changing and controlling his action.He had fully resolved on an
absence of some weeks, but the prolonged drought and the danger it
involved--the Cliffords would lose at least a thousand dollars should a
fire sweep over their mountain tract--made it seem wrong for him to leave
home until rain insured safety.Moreover, he believed that he detected
symptoms in Burt which, with his knowledge of his brother, led to hopes
that he could not banish.An occasional expression in Miss Hargrove's
dark eyes, also, did not tend to lessen these hopes."The lack of
conventionality incident to a mountain camp," he thought, "may develop
matters so rapidly as to remove my suspense.With all Amy's gentleness,
she is very sensitive and proud, and Burt cannot go much further with
Miss Hargrove without so awakening her pride as to render futile all
efforts to retrieve himself.After all, Miss Hargrove, perhaps, would
suit him far better than Amy.They are both fond of excitement and
society.At least, if the way were clear, I
would try as no man ever tried to win Amy, and I should be no worse off
than I am if I failed in the attempt."These musings were rather remote from his practical words, for he had
taken pains to give the impression that their woodland would be far safer
for the proposed expedition, and Amy had said, a little satirically, "We
are now sure of Webb, since he can combine so much business with
pleasure."He only smiled back in an inscrutable way.Musk-melons formed one of their breakfast dishes, and Miss Hargrove
remarked, "Papa has been exceedingly annoyed by having some of his finest
ones stolen."Burt began laughing, and said: "He should imitate my tactics.Ours were
stolen last year, and as they approached maturity, some time since, I put
up a notice in large black letters, 'Thieves, take warning: be careful
not to steal the poisoned melons.'Hearing a dog bark one night about a
week ago, I took a revolver and went out.The moonlight was clear, and
there, reading the notice, was a group of ragamuffin boys.Stealing up
near them, behind some shrubbery, I fired my pistol in the air, and they
fairly tumbled over each other in their haste to escape.We've had no
trouble since, I can assure you.I'll drive you home this morning, and,
with your father's permission, will put up a similar notice in your
garden.We also must make our arrangements for camping promptly.It surely will not if our mountain
experience makes us wish it would;" and, full of his projects, he
hastened to harness Thunder to his light top-wagon.He might have taken the two-seated carriage, and asked Amy to accompany
them, but it had not occurred to him to do so, especially as he intended
to drive on rapidly to Newburgh to make arrangements for the tents.She
felt a little slighted and neglected, and Miss Hargrove saw that she did,
but thought that any suggestion of a different arrangement might lead to
embarrassment.She began to think, with Webb, that the camping experience
would make everything clearer.At any rate, it promised so much
unhackneyed pleasure that she resolved to make the most of it, and then
decide upon her course.She was politic, and cautioned Burt to say
nothing until she had first seen her father, for she was not certain how
her stately and conventional mother would regard the affair.Hargrove in his library, and he knew from her preliminary
caresses that some unusual favor was to be asked."Come," he said, "you wily little strategist, what do you want now?His answer was unexpected, for he asked, "Is Mr."No," she replied, faintly; "he's on the piazza."Then, with unusual
animation, she began about the melons.Her father's face softened, and he
looked at her a little humorously, for her flushed, handsome face would
disarm a Puritan."You are seeing a great deal of this young Mr.Her color deepened, and she began, hastily, "Oh, well, papa, I've seen a
good deal of a great many gentlemen.""Come, come, Trurie, no disguises with me.Your old father is not so
blind as you think, and I've not lived to my time of life in ignorance of
the truth that prevention is better than cure.Whether you are aware of
it or not, your eyes have revealed to me a growing interest in Mr."He is a comparatively poor man, I suppose, and while I think him a fine
fellow, I've seen in him no great aptness for business.If I saw that he
was no more to you than others who have sought your favor, I would not
say a word, Trurie, for when you are indifferent you are abundantly able
to take care of yourself.I knew you would in
time meet some one who would have the power to do more than amuse you,
and my love, darling, is too deep and vigilant to be blind until it is
too late to see.You might
become more than interested during an experience like the one proposed.""If I should, papa, am I so poor that I have not even the privilege of a
village girl, who can follow her heart?""My advice would be," he replied, gently, "that you guide yourself by
both reason and your heart.This is our secret council-chamber, and one
is speaking to you who has no thought but for your lasting happiness."She took a chair near him, and looked into his eyes, as she said,
thoughtfully and gravely: "I should be both silly and unnatural, did I
not recognize your motive and love.I know I am not a child any longer,
and should have no excuse for any school-girl or romantic folly.You have
always had my confidence; you would have had it in this case as soon as
there was anything to tell.I scarcely understand myself as yet, but must
admit that I am more interested in Mr.Clifford than in any man I ever
met, and, as you said, I also have not reached my time of life without
knowing what this may lead to.You married mamma when she was younger
than I, and you, too, papa, were 'a comparatively poor man' at the time.I know all that wealth and
fashionable society can give me, and I tell you honestly, papa, I would
rather be the happy wife that Maggie Clifford is than marry any
millionaire in New York.There is no need, however, for such serious
talk, for there is nothing yet beyond congenial companionship, and--Well,"
she added, hastily, in memory of Amy, "I don't believe anything will come
of it.There will probably be two
married ladies in the party, and so I don't see that even mamma can
object.Best assured I shall never become engaged to any one without your
consent; that is," she added, with another of her irresistible caresses,
"unless you are very unreasonable, and I become very old.""Very well, Trurie, you shall go, with your mother's consent, and I think
I can insure that.As you say, you are no longer a child."And his
thought was, "I have seen enough of life to know that it is best not to
be too arbitrary in such matters."After a moment he added, gravely, "You
say you have thought.Think a great deal more before you take any steps
which may involve all your future."Burt was growing uneasy on the piazza, and feared that Miss Hargrove
might not obtain the consent that she had counted on so confidently.He
was a little surprised, also, to find how the glamour faded out of his
anticipations at the thought of her absence, but explained his feeling by
saying to himself, "She is so bright and full of life, and has so fine a
voice, that we should miss her sadly."He was greatly relieved,
therefore, when Mr.Hargrove came out and greeted him courteously.Gertrude had been rendered too conscious, by her recent interview, to
accompany her father, but she soon appeared, and no one could have
imagined that Burt was more to her than an agreeable acquaintance.Hargrove gave a reluctant consent, and it was soon settled that they
should try to get off on the afternoon of the following day.Burt also
included in the invitation young Fred Hargrove, and then drove away
elated.At the dinner-table he announced his success in procuring the tents, and
his intention of going for them in the afternoon.At the same time he
exhorted Leonard and Maggie to prepare provisions adequate to mountain
appetites, adding, "Webb, I suppose, will be too busy to do more than
join us at the last moment."Webb said nothing, but disappeared after dinner.As he was at supper as
usual, no questions were asked.Before it was light the next morning Amy
thought she heard steps on the stairs, and the rear hall-door shut
softly.When finally awaking, she was not sure but that her impression
was a dream.As she came down to breakfast Burt greeted her with dismay."The tents, that I put on the back piazza, are gone," he said.No one had seen him, and it was soon learned that a horse and a strong
wagon were also missing."Ah, Burt," cried Amy, laughing, "rest assured Webb has stolen a march on
you, and taken his own way of retaliation for what you said at the
dinner-table yesterday.I believe he
has chosen a camping-ground, and the tents are standing on it.""He should have remembered that others might have some choice in the
matter," was the discontented reply."If Webb has chosen the camping-ground, you will all be pleased with it,"
said his mother, quietly."I think he is merely trying to give a pleasant
surprise."He soon appeared, and explained that, with Lumley's help, he had made
some preparations, since any suitable place, with water near, from which
there was a fine outlook, would have seemed very rough and uninviting to
the ladies unless more work was done than could be accomplished in the
afternoon of their arrival."Now I think that is very thoughtful of you, Webb," said Amy."The steps
I heard last night were not a dream.At what unearthly hour did you
start?""Was I so heavy-footed as to disturb you?""Oh, no, Webb," she said, with a look of comic distress, in which there
was also a little reproach; "it's not your feet that disturb me, but your
head.You have stuffed it so full of learning that I am depressed by the
emptiness of mine."He laughed, as he replied, "I hope all your troubles may be quite as
imaginary."Then he told Leonard to spend the morning in helping Maggie,
who would know best what was needed for even mountain housekeeping, and
said that he would see to farm matters, and join them early in the
evening.The peaches were ripening, and Amy, from her window, saw that he
was taking from the trees all fit to market; also that Abram, under his
direction, was busy with the watering-cart."Words cannot impose upon
me," she thought, a little bitterly."He knows how I long for his
companionship, and it's not a little thing to be made to feel that I am
scarcely better qualified for it than Johnnie."Marvin's, who promised to join them, with his
wife, on the following day.He had a tent which he had occasionally used
in his ornithological pursuits.At two in the afternoon a merry party started for the hills.All the
vehicles on the farm had been impressed into the service to bring up the
party, with chairs, cooking-utensils, provisions, bedding, etc.When they
reached the ground that Webb had selected, even Burt admitted his pleased
surprise.The outlook over the distant river, and a wide area of country
dotted with villages, was superb, while to the camp a home-like look had
already been given, and the ladies, with many mental encomiums, saw how
secluded and inviting an aspect had been imparted to their especial
abode.As they came on the scene, Lumley was finishing the construction
of a dense screen of evergreen boughs, which surrounded the canvas to the
doorway.Not far away an iron pot was slung on a cross-stick in gypsy
style, and it was flanked by rock-work fireplaces which Maggie declared
were almost equal to a kitchen range.The men's tent was pitched at easy
calling distance, and, like that of the ladies, was surrounded by a thick
growth of trees, whose shade would be grateful.A little space had been
cleared between the two tents for a leaf-canopied dining-hall, and a
table of boards improvised.The ground, as far as possible, had been
cleared of loose stones and rubbish.Around the fireplace mossy rocks
abounded, and were well adapted for picturesque groupings.What touched
Amy most was a little flowerbed made of the rich black mould of decayed
leaves, in which were some of her favorite flowers, well watered.This
did not suggest indifference on the part of Webb.About fifty feet from
the tents the mountain shelf sloped off abruptly, and gave the
magnificent view that has been mentioned.Even Burt saw how much had been
gained by Webb's forethought, and frankly acknowledged it.As it was,
they had no more than time to complete the arrangements for the night
before the sun's level rays lighted up a scene that was full of joyous
activity and bustle.The children's happy voices made the echoes ring,
and Fred Hargrove, notwithstanding his city antecedents, yielded with
delight to the love of primitive life that exists in every boy's heart.Although he was a few years older than Alf, they had become friendly
rivals as incipient sportsmen and naturalists.Amy felt that she was
coming close to nature's heart, and the novelty of it all was scarcely
less exciting to her than to Johnnie.To little Ned it was a place of
wonder and enchantment, and he kept them all in a mild state of terror by
his exploring expeditions.At last his father threatened to take him
home, and, with this awful punishment before his eyes, he put his thumb
in his mouth, perched upon a rock, and philosophically watched the
preparations for supper.Maggie was the presiding genius of the occasion,
and looked like the light-hearted girl that Leonard had wooed more than a
dozen years before.She ordered him around, jested with him, and laughed
at him in such a piquant way that Burt declared she was proving herself
unfit for the duties of chaperon by getting up a flirtation with her
husband.Meanwhile, under her supervision, order was evoked from chaos,
and appetizing odors arose from the fireplace.Miss Hargrove admitted to herself that in all the past she had never
known such hours of keen enjoyment, and she was bent on proving that,
although a city-bred girl, she could take her part in the work as well as
in the fun.Nor were her spirits dampened by the fact that Burt was often
at her side, and that Amy did not appear to care.The latter, however,
was becoming aware of his deepening interesting in her brilliant friend.As yet she was not sure whether it was more than a good-natured and
hospitable effort to make one so recently a stranger at home with them,
or a new lapse on his part into a condition of ever-enduring love and
constancy--and the smile that followed the thought was not flattering to
Burt.A little before supper was ready Maggie asked him to get a pail of water."Come, Miss Gertrude," he said, "and I'll show you the Continental spring
at which the Revolutionary soldiers drank more than a hundred years ago;"
and she tripped away with him, nothing loth.As they reappeared, flushed
and laughing, carrying the pail between them, Amy trilled out,

"Jack and Jill came up the hill."A moment later, Webb followed them, on horseback, and was greeted with
acclamations and overwhelmed with compliments.Miss Hargrove was only too
glad of the diversion from herself, for Amy's words had made her absurdly
conscious for a society girl.Never had green corn, roasted in
its husks on the coals, tasted so delicious, and never before were
peaches and cream so ambrosial.Amy made it her care that poor Lumley
should feast also, but the smile with which she served him was the
sustenance he most craved.Then, as the evening breeze grew chilly, and
the night darkened, lanterns were hung in the trees, the fire was
replenished, and they sat down, the merriest of merry parties.Even Webb
had vowed that he would ignore the past and the future, and make the most
of that camp-fire by the wayside of life.It must be admitted, however,
that his discovery of Burt and Miss Hargrove alone at the spring had much
to do with his resolution.Stories and songs succeeded each other, until
Ned was asleep in Maggie's arms, and Johnnie nodding at her side.In
reaction from the excitements and fatigues of the day, they all early
sought the rest which is never found in such perfection as in a mountain
camp.Hemlock boughs formed the mattresses on which their blankets were
spread, and soon there were no sounds except the strident chirpings of
insects and the calls of night-birds.There was one perturbed spirit, however, and at last Burt stole out and
sat by the dying fire.When the mind is ready for impressions, a very
little thing will produce them vividly, and Amy's snatch of song about
"Jack and Jill" had awakened Burt at last to a consciousness that he
might be carrying his attention to Miss Hargrove too far, in view of his
vows and inexorable purpose of constancy.He assured himself that his
only object was to have a good time, and enjoy the charming society of
his new acquaintance.Of course, he was in love with Amy, and she was all
that he could desire.Girls
even like Amy were not so unsophisticated as they appeared to be, and he
felt that he was profoundly experienced in such questions, if in nothing
else.and would she not be led, by his
evident admiration for Miss Hargrove, to believe that he was mercurial
and not to be depended upon?He had to admit to himself that some
experiences in the past had tended to give him this reputation."I was
only a boy then," he muttered, with a stern compression of the lips."I'll prove that I am a man now;" and having made this sublime
resolution, he slept the sleep of the just.All who have known the freshness, the elasticity, the mental and physical
vigor, with which one springs from a bed of boughs, will envy the camping
party's awakening on the following morning.Webb resolved to remain and
watch the drift of events, for he was growing almost feverish in his
impatience for more definite proof that his hopes were not groundless.But he was doomed to disappointment and increasing doubt.Burt began to
show himself a skilful diplomatist.He felt that, perhaps, he had checked
himself barely in time to retrieve his fortunes and character with Amy,
but he was too adroit to permit any marked change to appear in his manner
and action.He said to himself that he cordially liked and admired Miss
Hargrove, but he believed that she had enjoyed not a few flirtations, and
was not averse to the addition of another to the list.Even his
self-complacency had not led him to think that she regarded him in any
other light than that of a very agreeable and useful summer friend.He
had seen enough of society to be aware that such temporary friendships
often border closely on the sentimental, and yet with no apparent trace
remaining in after-years.To Amy, however, such affairs would not appear
in the same light as they might to Miss Hargrove, and he felt that he had
gone far enough.But not for the world would he be guilty of _gaucherie,_
of neglecting Miss Hargrove for ostentatious devotion to Amy.Indeed, he
was more pronounced in his admiration than ever, but in many little
unobtrusive ways he tried to prove to Amy that she had his deeper thoughts.She, however, was not at this time disposed to dwell upon the subject.His
manner merely tended to confirm the view that he, like herself, regarded
Miss Hargrove as a charming addition to their circle, and proposed that she
should enjoy herself thoroughly while with them.Amy also reproached
herself a little that she had doubted him so easily, and felt that he was
giving renewed proof of his good sense.He could be true to her, and yet be
most agreeable to her friend, and her former acquiescence in the future of
his planning remained undisturbed.Webb was more like the brother she
wished him to be than he had been for a long time.The little flowerbed was
an abiding reassurance, and so the present contained all that she desired.This was not true of either Webb or Miss Hargrove.The former, however,
did not lose heart.He thought he knew Burt too well to give up hope yet.The latter, with all her experience, was puzzled.She speedily became
conscious of the absence of a certain warmth and genuineness in Bart's
manner and words.The thermometer is not so sensitive to heat and cold as
the intuition of a girl like Miss Hargrove to the mental attitude of an
admirer, but no one could better hide her thoughts and feelings than she
when once upon her guard.CHAPTER XLIII

AN OLD TENEMENT


The few remaining days of August passed, and September came, bringing
little suggestion of autumn rains or coolness.Marvin had
joined them, and the former's interest in every wild creature of the
woods became infectious.Alf and Fred were his ardent disciples, and he
rarely found an indifferent listener in Amy.The heat of the day was
given up to reading and the fashioning of alpenstocks, and the mornings
and late afternoons to excursions.In one of these they had sat down to
rest near an immense decaying tree that was hollow in parts, and full of
holes from the topmost shattered branches to the ground."That," said the doctor, "might fitly be called an old tenement-house.You have no idea how many and various creatures may have found a home in
it."He was immediately urged to enumerate its possible inhabitants in the
past, present, and future.The doctor, pleased with the conceit of regarding the decaying tree in
this light, began with animation: "All three of the squirrels of this
region have undoubtedly dwelt in it.I scarcely need do more than mention
the well-known saucy red or fox squirrel, whose delight is mischief.By
the way, we have at home two tame robins that before they could fly were
tumbled out of their nest by one of these ruthless practical jokers.The
birds come in and out of the house like members of the family.The
graceful gray squirrel is scarcely less familiar than the red one.He
makes a lively pet, and we have all seen him turning the wheel attached
to his cage.The curious little flying-squirrel, however, is a stranger
even to those to whom he may be a near neighbor, for the reason that his
habits are chiefly nocturnal.He ventures out occasionally on a cloudy
day, but is shy and retiring.Thoreau relates an interesting experience
with one.He captured it in a decayed hemlock stump, wherein it had a
little nest of leaves, bits of bark, and pine needles.It bit viciously
at first, and uttered a few 'dry shrieks,' but he carried it home.After
it had been in his room a few hours it reluctantly allowed its soft fur
to be stroked.He says it had'very large, prominent black eyes, which
gave it an innocent look.In color it was a chestnut ash, inclining to
fawn, slightly browned, and white beneath.tinged yellow, the upper dark, perhaps black.'He put it into a
barrel, and fed it with an apple and shag-bark hickory-nuts.The next
morning he carried it back and placed it on the stump from which it had
been taken, and it ran up a sapling, from which it skimmed away to a
large maple nine feet distant, whose trunk it struck about four feet from
the ground.This tree it ascended thirty feet on the opposite side from
Thoreau, then, coming into view, it eyed its quondam captor for a moment
or two, as much as to say 'good-by.'Then away it went, first raising its
head as if choosing its objective point.Thoreau says its progress is
more like that of a bird than he had been led to believe from naturalists'
accounts, or than he could have imagined possible in a quadruped.Its
flight was not a regular descent on a given line.It veered to right and
left, avoiding obstructions, passed between branches of trees, and flew
horizontally part of the way, landing on the ground at last, over fifty-one
feet from the foot of the tree from which it sprang.After its leap,
however, it cannot renew its impetus in the air, but must alight and start
again.It appears to sail and steer much like a hawk when the latter does
not flap its wings.The little striped chipmunk, no doubt, has heaped up
its store of nuts in the hole there that opens from the ground into the
tree, and the pretty white-footed mouse, with its large eyes and ears, has
had its apartment in the decayed recesses that exist in the worm-eaten
roots."Opossums and raccoons are well-known denizens of trees, and both furnish
famous country sports, especially in the South.''Possum up de gum-tree,
cooney in de hollow,' is a line from a <DW64> ditty that touches a deep
chord in the African heart.The former is found not infrequently in this
region, but the Hudson seems to be the eastern boundary of its habitat.""I took two from a tree in one night," Burt remarked."The raccoon's haunts, however, extend far to the northward, and it is
abundant in the regions bordering on the Adirondacks, though not common
in the dense pine woods of the interior.They are omnivorous creatures,
and often rob nests of eggs and young birds, for they are expert
climbers.They are fond of nuts and fruits, and especially of corn when
in the condition of a milky pulp.They are
also eager fishermen, although they are unable to pursue their prey under
water like the otter and mink.They like to play in shallows, and leave
no stone unturned in the hope of finding a crawfish under it.If fish have
been left in land-locked pools, they are soon devoured.'<DW53>-hunting by
the light of the harvest-moon has long been one of the most noted of rural
sports.During this month the corn kernels are in the most toothsome state
for the '<DW53> bill of fare, and there are few fields near forests where
they will not be marauding to-night, for they are essentially night
prowlers.A '<DW53> hunt usually takes place near midnight.Men, with dogs
trained to the sport, will repair to a cornfield known to be infested.The
feasters are soon tracked and treed, then shot, or else the tree is felled,
when such a snarling fight ensues as creates no little excitement.No
matter how plucky a cur may be, he finds his match in an old '<DW53>, and
often carries the scars of combat to his dying day."If taken when young, raccoons make amusing pets, and become attached to
their masters, but they cannot be allowed at large, for they are as
mischievous as monkeys.Their curiosity is boundless, and they will pry
into everything within reach.Anything, to be beyond their reach, must be
under lock and key.They use their forepaws as hands, and will unlatch a
door with ease, and soon learn to turn a knob.Alf there could not begin
to ravage a pantry like a tame '<DW53>.They will devour honey, molasses,
sugar, pies, cake, bread, butter, milk--anything edible.They will
uncover preserve-jars as if Mrs.Leonard had given them lessons, and with
the certainty of a toper uncork a bottle and get drunk on its contents.""No pet '<DW53>s, Alf, if you please," said his mother."Raccoons share with Reynard his reputation for cunning," the doctor
resumed, "and deserve it, but they do not use this trait for
self-preservation.They are not suspicious of unusual objects, and,
unlike a fox, are easily trapped.They hibernate during the coldest part
of the winter, reappearing in the latter part of February or March.They
are fond of little excursions, and usually travel in small family
parties, taking refuge in hollow trees about daylight.They make their
home high up, and prefer a hollow limb to the trunk of a tree.Some of
those half-decayed limbs yonder would just suit them.They have their
young in April--from four to six--and these little '<DW53>s remain with the
mother a year.While young they are fair eating, but grow tough and rank
with age."Two other interesting animals may have lived in that tree, the least
weasel and his sanguinary cousin the ermine, or large weasel.Both are
brown, after the snow finally disappears, and both turn white with the
first snowstorm.""Now you are romancing, doctor," cried Miss Hargrove."Yes," added Leonard, "tell us that you have caught a weasel asleep, and
we will, at least, look credulous; but this turning white with the first
snow, and brown as soon as the snow is gone, is a little off color.""It's true, nevertheless," maintained the doctor, "although I have seen
no satisfactory explanation of the changes.They not only make their
nests in hollow trees, but in the sides of banks.Were it not for its
habit of destroying the eggs and young of birds, the least weasel might
be regarded as a wholly useful creature, for it devours innumerable mice,
moles, shrews, and insects, and does not attack larger animals or
poultry.It is so exceedingly lithe and slender that its prey has no
chance to escape.Where a mouse or a mole can go it can go also, and if
outrun in the field, it follows the scent of its game like a hound, and
is as relentless as fate in its pursuit.They are not very shy, and
curiosity speedily overcomes their timidity.Sit down quietly, and they
will investigate you with intense interest, and will even approach rather
near in order to see better.Merriam describes one as standing
bolt-upright, and eying him, with its head bent at right angles to its
slender body.After a brief retreat it made many partial advances toward
him, meanwhile constantly sniffing the air in his direction.Merriam would have liked to know the weasel's opinion.They
have two or three litters a year, and the nest is made of dry leaves and
herbage.The mother weasel will defend her young at any cost, and never
hesitates to sacrifice her life in their behalf.She will fasten herself
by her sharp teeth to the nose of a dog, and teach him that weasel-hunting
has some drawbacks."In its next of kin, the ermine, or large weasel, we have perhaps the
most cruel and bloodthirsty animal in existence.It is among mammals what
the butcher-bird is among the feathered tribes--an assassin, a beautiful
fiend.It would seem that nature reproduces among animals and plants
every phase of human character.Was it Nero or Caligula who said, 'Oh,
that Rome had but one neck, that I might sever it?'Such is the spirit
that animates the ermine.Its instinct to kill is so strong that, were it
possible, it would destroy the means of its subsistence.It would leave
none of its varied prey alive.The lion and even the man-eating tiger,
when gorged, are inert and quiet.They kill no more than they want for a
meal; but the ermine will attack a poultry-yard, satiate itself with the
brains of the fowls or by sucking their blood, and then, out of 'pure
cussedness,' will kill all the rest within reach.Fifty chickens have
been destroyed in a night by one of these remorseless little beasts.It
makes fearful ravages among grouse, rabbits, and hares.It is the
mythical vampire embodied.It is not very much larger than the least
weasel, and has the same long, lithe, slender body and neck.A gray
squirrel would look bulky beside one, but in indomitable courage and
pitiless ferocity I do not think it has an equal.Only a lack of material
or bodily fatigue suspends its bloody work, and its life is one long
career of carnage.It has a terrific set of teeth, which are worked by
most powerful muscles.Coues, an eminent naturalist, has given a
graphic account of him.His words, as I remember them, are a true
portrait of a murderer.'His forehead is low, and nose sharp; his eyes
are small, penetrating, cunning, and glitter with an angry green light.His fierce face surmounts a body extraordinarily wiry, lithe, and
muscular, which ends in a singularly long, slender neck that can be
lifted at right angles with the body.When he is looking around, his neck
stretched up, his flat triangular head bent forward, swaying to and fro,
we have the image of a serpent.'"This is a true picture of the ermine when excited or angry; when at
rest, and in certain conditions of his fur, there are few more beautiful,
harmless, innocent-looking creatures.Let one of the animals on which he
preys approach, however, and instantly he becomes a demon.In the economy
of nature he often serves a very useful purpose.In many regions field
mice are destructive.A rat will fight
a man, if cornered, but it gives up at once in abject terror when
confronted by the large weasel.This arch-enemy has a pride in his
hunting, and when taking up his quarters in a barn will collect in one
place all the rats and mice he kills.Sometimes a hundred or more have
been found together as the result of two or three nights' work.The
ermine hunts, however, both by day and night, and climbs trees with great
facility.He is by no means shy, and one has been known to try to kill
chickens in a coop when a man was standing near him.Hunger was not his
motive, for he had destroyed dozens of fowls the night before.The ermine
has been used successfully as a ferret.Having first filed the creature's
teeth down, so that it could not kill the game, a gentleman secured
twelve live rabbits in one forenoon."But it's getting late, and time we started tentward, and yet I'm not
through even the list of quadrupeds that may have dwelt in our old
tenement.There are four species of bats to be mentioned, besides moles
and shrews, that would burrow in its roots if they are as hollow as the
branches.There are thirteen species of birds, including several very
interesting families of woodpeckers, that would live in a tree like that,
not to speak of tree-toads, salamanders, brown tree-lizards, insects and
slugs innumerable, and black-snakes--"

"Snakes?"I once put my hand in a hole for high-holders' eggs, and a
big black-snake ran down my back, but not inside of my coat, however.""Please say nothing more about snakes," cried Amy; and she rose
decisively, adding, in a low tone: "Come, Gertrude, let us go.The
tenants of the old tree that we've heard about may be very interesting to
naturalists, but some of them are no more to my taste than the people in
the slums of London.""You have made our blood run cold with horrors--an agreeable sensation,
however, to-day," said Burt, also rising."Your ermine out-Herods Herod.By the way, is not the fur of this pitiless beast worn by the highest
dignitaries of the legal profession?"CHAPTER XLIV

"BUT HE RISKED HIS LIFE?"The days passed, and the novelty of their mountain life began to wane a
little.There were agreeable episodes, as, for instance, visits from Mr.Barkdale, who were entertained
in royal style; but, after all, the camping experience was not,
apparently, fulfilling the hopes of two of the party.Webb's doubt and
suspense had only been increased, and Miss Hargrove was compelled to
admit to herself that her father's fears were not groundless.She was the
life of the party, and yet she was not at rest.Even in her dreams there
was a minor key of trouble and dread.The past few weeks were bringing a
revelation.She had read novels innumerable; she had received tender
confidences from friends.Love had been declared to her, and she had seen
its eloquent pleading in more than one face; but she acknowledged that
she had never known the meaning of the word until, without her volition,
her own heart revealed to her the mystery.Reason and will might control
her action, but she could no more divert her thoughts from Burt Clifford
than a flower can turn from the sun.She wondered at herself, and was
troubled.She had supposed that the training of society had brought her
perfect self-possession, and she had looked forward to a match, when she
was ready for one, in which the pros and cons should be weighed with
diplomatic nicety; but now that her heart was touched she learned that
nature is supreme, and her whole being revolted at such a union as she
had contemplated.She saw the basis of true marriage--the glad consent of
body and soul, and not a calculation.She watched Maggie closely, and saw
that her life was happy and rounded out in spite of her many cares.It
was not such a life as she would choose in its detail, and yet it was
infinitely better than that of many of her acquaintances.Burt was no
hero in her eyes, but he was immensely companionable, and it was a
companion, not a hero, or a man remote from her life and interests, that
she desired.He was refined and intelligent, if not learned; low, mean
traits were conspicuously absent; but, above and beyond all, his mirthful
blue eyes, and spirited ways and words, set all her nerves tingling with
a delicious exhilaration which she could neither analyze nor control.In
brief, the time that her father foresaw had come; the man had appeared
who could do more than amuse; her whole nature had made its choice.She
could go back to the city, and still in semblance be the beautiful and
brilliant girl that she had been; but she knew that in all the future few
waking hours would pass without her thoughts reverting to that little
mountain terrace, its gleaming canvas, its gypsy-like fire, with a tall,
lithe form often reclining at her feet beside it.Would the future bring more than regretful memories?As time passed, she
feared not.As Burt grew conscious of himself, his pride was deeply touched.He knew
that he had been greatly fascinated by Miss Hargrove, and, what was
worse, her power had not declined after he had awakened to his danger;
but he felt that Amy and all the family would despise him--indeed, that
he would despise himself--should he so speedily transfer his allegiance;
and under the spur of this dread he made especial, though very
unobtrusive, efforts to prove his loyalty to Amy.Therefore Webb had
grown despondent, and his absences from the camp were longer and more
frequent He pleaded the work of the farm, and the necessity of coping
with the fearful drought, so plausibly that Amy felt that she could not
complain, but, after all, there was a low voice of protest in her heart."It's the old trouble," she thought."The farm interests him far more
than I ever can, and even when here his mind is absent."Thus it may be seen that Nature, to whom they had gone, was not only busy
with the mountain and its life, but that her silent forces were also at
work in those whose unperverted hearts were not beyond her power.But there are dark mysteries in Nature, and some of her creations appear
to be visible and concentrated evil.The camping party came very near
breaking up in a horrible tragedy.The day was growing warm, and they
were returning from a rather extended excursion, straggling along a steep
wood road that was partially overgrown with bushes.Burt had been a
little more attentive to Miss Hargrove than usual, but was now at Amy's
side with his ready laugh and jest.Marvin was in the rear, peering
about, as usual, for some object of interest to a naturalist.Miss
Hargrove, so far from succumbing to the increasing heat, was reluctant to
return, and seemed possessed with what might be almost termed a nervous
activity.She had been the most indefatigable climber of the party, and
on their return had often diverged from the path to gather a fern or some
other sylvan trifle.At one point the ascending path formed an angle with
a ledge of rock that made a little platform.At the further end of this
she saw a flower, and she went to get it.A moment or two later Burt and
Amy heard her scream, and the sound of her voice seemed almost beneath
them.Grasping his alpenstock firmly, Burt sprang through the intervening
copsewood, and witnessed a scene that he never forgot, though he paused
not a second in his horror.Even as he rushed toward her a huge
rattlesnake was sending forth the "long, loud, stinging whir" which, as
Dr.Holmes says, is "the dreadful sound that nothing which breathes can
hear unmoved."Miss Hargrove was looking down upon it, stupefied,
paralyzed with terror.Already the reptile was coiling its thick body for
the deadly stroke, when Burt's stock fell upon its neck and laid it
writhing at the girl's feet.With a flying leap from the rock above he
landed on the venomous head, and crushed it with his heel.He had
scarcely time to catch Miss Hargrove, when she became apparently a
lifeless burden in his arms.Marvin now reached him, and after a glance at the scene exclaimed,
"Great God!"No; but let us get away from here.Where there's one of these devils
there is usually another not far off;" and they carried the unconscious
girl swiftly toward the camp, which fortunately was not far away, all the
others following with dread and anxiety in their faces.Marvin's and Maggie's efforts soon revived Miss Hargrove, but she had
evidently received a very severe nervous shock.When at last Burt was
permitted to see her, she gave him her hand with such a look of gratitude,
and something more, which she could not then disguise, that his heart began
to beat strangely fast.He was so confused that he could only stammer some
incoherent words of congratulation; but he half-consciously gave her hand a
pressure that left the most delicious pain the young girl had ever known.He was deeply excited, for he had taken a tremendous risk in springing upon
a creature that can strike its crooked fangs through the thick leather of a
boot, as a New York physician once learned at the cost of his life, when he
carelessly sought to rouse with his foot a caged reptile of this kind.Miss Hargrove had ceased to be a charming summer acquaintance to Burt.She was the woman at whose side he had stood in the presence of death.Before their midday repast was ready a rumble of wagons was heard coming
up the mountain, and Webb soon appeared."The barometer is falling
rapidly," he said, "and father agrees with me that it will be safer for
you all to return at once."He found ready acquiescence, for after the event of the morning the
ladies were in haste to depart.Lumley, who had come up with Webb, was
sent to take the rattles from the snake, and the men drew apart, with Alf
and Fred, to discuss the adventure, for it was tacitly agreed that it
would be unwise to talk about snakes to those whose nerves were already
unstrung at the thought of such fearful neighbors.Marvin would have
gone with Lumley had not his wife interposed.As it was, he had much to
say concerning the habits and character of the reptiles, to which the
boys listened with awe."By the way," he concluded, "I remember a passage
from that remarkable story, 'Elsie Venner,' by Oliver Wendell Holmes, in
which he gives the most vivid description of the rattlesnake I have ever
seen.One of his characters has two of them in a cage.'The expression of
the creatures,' he writes, 'was watchful, still, grave, passionless,
fate-like, suggesting a cold malignity which seemed to be waiting for its
opportunity.Their awful, deep-cut mouths were sternly closed over long,
hollow fangs, which rested their roots against the swollen poison-gland
where the venom had been hoarded up ever since the last stroke had
emptied it.They never winked, for ophidians have no movable eyelids, but
kept up an awful fixed stare.Their eyes did not flash, but shone with a
cold, still light.They were of a pale golden color, horrible to look
into, with their stony calmness, their pitiless indifference, hardly
enlivened by the almost imperceptible vertical slit of the pupil, through
which Death seemed to be looking out, like the archer behind the long,
narrow loophole in a blank turret wall.'The description is superb, and
impressed itself so deeply on my mind that I can always recall it."The ladies now joined them at dinner--the last at their rustic board.Miss Hargrove was very pale, but she was a spirited girl, and was bent on
proving that there was nothing weak or hysterical in her nature.Neither
was there the flippancy that a shallow woman might have manifested.She
acted like a brave, well-bred lady, whose innate refinement and good
sense enabled her speedily to regain her poise, and take her natural
place among her friends.They all tried to be considerate, and Amy's
solicitude did not indicate the jealousy that her friend almost expected
to see.Before they had finished their repast an east wind was moaning and
sighing in the trees, and a thin scud of clouds overcasting the sky.They
were soon in the haste and bustle of departure.Miss Hargrove found an
opportunity, however, to draw Dr.Marvin aside, and asked, hesitatingly,

"If Burt--if Mr.Clifford had missed his aim when he sprang upon the
snake, what would have happened?""You had better not dwell on that scene for the present, Miss Hargrove.""But I wish to know," she said, decisively."I am not a child, and I
think I have a right to know.""Well," said the doctor, gravely, "you are brave about it, and may as
well know the truth.Indeed, a little thought would soon make it clear to
you that if he had struck the body of the snake and left its head free,
it would have bitten him."She drew a long breath, and said, "I thought as much"; then added, in a
low tone, "Would it have been death?""Not necessarily; but only the most vigorous treatment could have saved
him.""Certainly; but a brave man could scarcely have acted otherwise.The
snake was at your very feet.""Thank you," she said, simply, and there was a very gentle expression in
her eyes.Much of the work of breaking up was left to Lumley, and an abundant
reward for his labor.He had returned with an exultant grin, but at a
sign from Dr.As soon as he had a chance,
however, he gave Burt two rattles, one having twelve and the other
fourteen joints, thus proving the fear, that the mate of the snake first
killed was not far off, to be well grounded.At the foot of the mountain
they met Mr.He explained that his barometer
and the indications of a storm had alarmed him also, and that he had come
for his daughter and Fred.Nothing was said of Miss Hargrove's recent
peril in the brief, cordial parting.Her eyes and Burt's met almost
involuntarily as she was driven away, and he was deeply perturbed.The face of Nature was also clouding fast, and she was sighing and
moaning as if she, too, dreaded the immediate future.CHAPTER XLV

SUMMER'S WEEPING FAREWELL


Nature was at last awakening from her long, deathlike repose with an
energy that was startling.The thin skirmish-line of vapor was followed
by cloudy squadrons, and before sunset great masses of mist were pouring
over Storm King, suggesting that the Atlantic had taken the drought in
hand, and meant to see what it could do.The wind mourned and shrieked
about the house, as if trouble, and not relief, were coming.In spite of
the young moon, the night grew intensely dark.The dash of rain was
expected every moment, but it did not come.Amy thought with a shudder of their desolate camping-ground.Time must
pass before pleasant associations could be connected with it.The intense
darkness, the rush and roar of the coming storm, the agony, the death
that might have occurred there, were now uppermost in her mind.She had
found an opportunity to ask Webb questions similar to those of Miss
Hargrove, and he had given Burt full credit for taking a fearful risk.A
woman loves courage in the abstract, and when it is shown in behalf of
herself or those whom she loves, he who has manifested it became heroic.But her homage troubled Burt, who was all at sea, uncertain of himself,
of the future, of almost everything, but not quite uncertain as to Miss
Hargrove.There was something in her look when they first met after their
common peril that went straight to his deepest consciousness.He had
before received, with not a little complacency, glances of preference,
but none like that, in which a glimpse of feeling, deep and strong, had
been revealed in a moment of weakness.The thought of it moved him far
more profoundly than the remembrance of his danger.Indeed, he scarcely
thought of that, except as it was associated with a girl who now might
have been dead or dying, and who, by a glance, had seemed to say, "What
you saved is yours."If this were true it was indeed a priceless, overwhelming gift, and he
was terrified at himself as he found how his whole nature was responding.He also knew that it was not in his frank, impetuous spirit to disguise
deep feeling.Should Miss Hargrove control his heart, he feared that all
would eventually know it, as they had speedily discovered his other
little affairs.And little, indeed, they now seemed to him, relating to
girls as immature as himself.Some had since married, others were
engaged, "and none ever lost their appetites," he concluded, with a grim
smile.But he could not thus dismiss the past so far as Amy was concerned, the
orphan girl in his own home to whom he had promised fealty.What would be
his feeling toward another man who had promised so much and had proved
fickle?What would the inmates of his own home say?What would even his
gentle mother, of whom he had made a confidante, think of him?Would not
a look of pain, or, even worse, of scorn, come into Amy's eyes?He did
love her dearly; he respected her still more as the embodiment of truth
and delicacy.From Miss Hargrove's manner he knew that Amy had never
gossiped about him, as he felt sure nine-tenths of his acquaintances
would have done.He also believed that she was taking him at his word,
like the rest of the family, and that she was looking forward to the
future that he had once so ardently desired.The past had taught him that
she was not one to fall tumultuously in love, but rather that she would
let a quiet and steady flame kindle in her heart, to last through life.She had proved herself above hasty and resentful jealousy, but she had,
nevertheless, warned him on the mountain, and had received the renewed
manifestations of his loyalty as a matter of course.Since his rescue of
her friend in the morning her eyes had often sought his with a lustre so
gentle and approving that he felt guilty, and cursed himself for a fickle
wretch.Cost him what it might, he must be true to her.She, little divining his tragic mood, which, with the whole force of his
will, he sought to disguise, gave him an affectionate good-night kiss as
she said, "Dear Burt, how happily the day has ended, after all!--and we
know the reason why.""Yes, Burt," added Webb; "no man ever did a braver thing."His father's hearty praise, and even his mother's grateful and almost
passionate embrace, only added to his deep unrest.As he went to his room
he groaned, "If they only knew!"After very little and troubled sleep he awoke on the following morning
depressed and exhausted.Mental distress was a new experience, and he
showed its effects; but he made light of it, as the result of
over-excitement and fatigue.He felt that Nature harmonized with his
mood, for he had scarcely ever looked upon a gloomier sky.Yet, strange
to say, no rain had fallen.It seemed as if the malign spell could not be
broken.The wind that had been whirling the dust in clouds all night long
grew fitful, and died utterly away, while the parched earth and withered
herbage appeared to look at the mocking clouds in mute, despairing
appeal.How could they be so near, so heavy, and yet no rain?The air was
sultry and lifeless.Fall had come, but no autumn days as yet.Clifford looked often at the black, lowering sky, and
predicted that a decided change was at hand."My fear is," he added, "that the drought may be followed by a deluge.I
don't like the looks of the clouds in the southeast."Even as he spoke a gleam of lightning shot athwart them, and was soon
followed by a heavy rumble of thunder.It seemed that the electricity,
or, rather, the concussion of the air, precipitated the dense vapor into
water, for within a few moments down came the rain in torrents.As the
first great drops struck the roads the dust flew up as if smitten by a
blow, and then, with scarcely any interval, the gutters and every incline
were full of tawny rills, that swelled and grew with hoarser and deeper
murmurs, until they combined in one continuous roar with the downfall
from clouds that seemed scarcely able to lift themselves above the
tree-tops.The lightning was not vivid, but often illumined the obscurity
with a momentary dull red glow, and thunder muttered and growled in the
distance almost without cessation.To Amy its gloomy, portentous ending was
even more so.The arid noonday heat and glare of preceding days had given
place to a twilight so unnatural that it had almost the awe-inspiring
effect of an eclipse.The hitherto brazen sky seemed to have become an
overhanging reservoir from which poured a vertical cataract.The clouds
drooped so heavily, and were so black, that they gave an impression of
impending solid masses that might fall at any moment with crushing
weight.Within an hour the beds of streams long dry were full and
overflowing.In spite of remonstrances Webb put on a rubber suit, and went to look
after some little bridges on the place.He soon returned, and said, "If
this keeps up until morning, there will be a dozen bridges lacking in our
region.I've tried to anchor some of our little affairs by putting heavy
stones on them, so that the water will pass over instead of sweeping them
away.It makes one think that the flood was no myth."To the general relief, the rain slackened in the late afternoon, and soon
ceased.The threatening pall of clouds lifted a little, and in rocky
channels on the mountains the dull gleam of rushing water could be seen.From every side its voice was heard, the scale running up, from the
gurgle in the pipes connected with the roof, to the roar of the nearest
large stream.As the day advanced Burt had grown very restless.The long day of imprisonment had given time for thought, and a
review of the past novel and exciting experiences.She had not seen the
glances from Miss Hargrove which had suggested so much to Burt, but she
had long since perceived that her friend greatly enjoyed his society.Had
she loved him she would have seen far more.If this interest had been
shown in Webb, she would have understood herself and Miss Hargrove also
much better.Preoccupied as she was by her sense of loss and shortcoming
produced by Webb's apparent absorption in pursuits which she did not
share, the thought had repeatedly occurred to her that Miss Hargrove's
interest in Burt might be more than passing and friendly.If this were
true, she was sure the event of the preceding day must develop and deepen
it greatly.And now Burt's manner, his fits of absent-mindedness, during
which he stared at vacancy, awakened surmises also.she queried, and she resolved to find out."Burt," she said, arousing him from one of the lapses into deep thought
which alternated with his restless pacings and rather forced gayety, "it
has stopped raining.I think you ought to ride over and see how Gertrude
is."Do you truly think I ought to go?""Certainly, and it would be a favor to me also," she added.He looked at her searchingly for a moment, but there was nothing in her
friendly expression to excite his fears."Very well," he tried to say quietly.A swift gallop would do
me good, I believe.""Of course it will, and so will a walk brighten me up.I'm going out to
see the brook.""Let me go with you," he exclaimed, with an eagerness too pronounced.I'd rather hear how Gertrude is;" and she went to her room
to prepare for her walk, smiling a little bitterly as she mused: "I now
know where his thoughts were.Not only brother
Webb, but also lover Burt, has grown weary of me.I can't entertain
either of them through one rainy day."From her window she saw Burt
riding away with a promptness that brought again the smile rarely seen on
her fair features.In her light rubber suit, she started on her ramble,
her face almost as clouded as the sky.Another had been on the watch
also, and Webb soon joined her, with the question, "May I not go too?""Oh, I fear it will take too much of your time," she said, in tones that
were a little constrained.He, too, had been interpreting Burt, and
guessed his destination as he galloped away.His love for Amy was so deep
that in a generous impulse of self-forgetfulness he was sorry for her,
and sought to cheer her, and make what poor amends he could for Burt's
absence, and all that it foreboded."Since you don't say outright that I
can't go," he said, "I think I'll venture;" and then, in a quiet, genial
way, he began to talk about the storm and its effects.She would not have
believed that even remarkable weather could be made so interesting a
topic as it soon proved.Before long they stood upon the bank, and saw a
dark flood rushing by where but yesterday had trickled a little rill.Now
it would carry away horse and rider, should they attempt to ford it, and
the fields beyond were covered with water."I don't like these violent changes," said Amy."Tennyson's brook, that
'goes on forever,' is more to my taste than one like this, that almost
stops, and then breaks out into a passionate, reckless torrent.""It's the nature of this brook; you should not blame it," he answered."But see, it's falling rapidly already.""Oh, certainly; nothing lasts," and she turned away abruptly."You are mistaken, sister Amy," he replied, with strong, quiet emphasis.The early twilight deepened around them, and gloomy night came on apace,
but before Amy re-entered the house his unselfish efforts were rewarded.Burt's threatened disloyalty apparently had lost its depressing
influence.Some subtile reassuring power had been at work, and the clouds
passed from her face, if not from the sky.CHAPTER XLVI

FATHER AND DAUGHTER


That sombre day would ever be a memorable one to Miss Hargrove.Nature
seemed weeping passionately over the summer that had gone, with all its
wealth of beauty and life.She knew that her girlhood had gone with it.She had cautioned her brother to say nothing of her escape on the
previous day, for she was too unnerved to go over the scene again that
night, and meet her father's questioning eyes.She wanted to be alone
first and face the truth; and this she had done in no spirit of weak
self-deception.The shadow of the unknown had fallen upon her, and in its
cold gray light the glitter and tinsel of the world had faded, but
unselfish human love had grown more luminous.The imminence of death had
kindled rather than quenched it.It was seen to be something intrinsically
precious, something that might survive even the deadliest poison.Her father was disposed to regard Burt as one who looked upon life in the
light of a pleasure excursion, and who might never take it seriously.His
laugh hereafter could never be so light and careless to her but that,
like a minor key, would run the thought, "He risked his life for me; he
might have died for me."Her dark, full eyes, the warm blood that her thoughts brought into her
face even in the solitude of her chamber, did not belie her nature, which
was intense, and capable of a strong and an abiding passion when once
kindled.Hargrove had watched her with the deepest solicitude on her return,
and he felt rather than saw the change that had taken place in his idol.In the morning she was again
conscious of his half-questioning scrutiny, and when he went to his study
she followed, and told him what had occurred.He grew very pale, and drew
a long, deep breath.Then, as if mastered by a strong impulse, he clasped
her to his heart, and said, in trembling tones, "Oh, Trurie, if I had
lost you!""I fear you would have lost me, papa, had it not been for Mr.He paced the room for a few moments in agitation, and at last stopped
before her and said: "Perhaps in a sense I am to lose you after all."No, papa; he has only risked his life to save mine.""Do not think I underestimate his act, Trurie; but, believe me, if he
should speak now or soon, you are in no condition to answer him.""He did what any man would do for a woman in peril.He has no right to
claim such an immense reward.""Before I went to the mountains I said I was no longer a child; but I
was, compared with what I am now.It seems to me that feeling,
experience, more than years, measures our age.I am a woman to-day, one
who has been brought so near the future world that I have been taught how
to value what may be ours now.I have learned how to value you and your
unselfish love as I never did before.Clifford will not speak very
soon, if he ever does, and I have not yet decided upon my answer.Should
it be favorable, rest assured more than gratitude will prompt me; and
also be assured you would not lose me.Could I not be more to you were I
happy than if I went through life with the feeling that I had missed my
chance?""I fear your mother would never give her consent to so unworldly a
choice," he said, with a troubled brow."I've yet to be convinced that it would be such a choice.It's scarcely
unworldly to make the most and the best of the world one is in, and mamma
must permit me to judge for myself, as she chose for herself.I shall
never marry any one but a gentleman, and one who can give me a home.Have
I not a right to prefer a home to an establishment, papa?"He looked at her long and searchingly, and she met his scrutiny with a
grave and gentle dignity."I suppose we must submit to the inevitable,"
he said at last."It seems but the other day that you were a baby on my knee," he began,
sadly; "and now you are drifting far away.""No, papa, there shall be no drifting whatever.I shall marry, if ever,
one whom I have learned to love according to Nature's simple laws--one to
whom I can go without effort or calculation.I could give my heart, and
be made rich indeed by the gift.I couldn't invest it; and if I did, no
one would be more sorry than you in the end.""I should indeed be more than sorry if I ever saw you unhappy," he said,
after another thoughtful pause; then added, shaking his head, "I've seen
those who gave their hearts even more disappointed with life than those
who took counsel of prudence.""I shall take counsel of prudence, and of you too, papa.""I think it is as I feared--you have already given your heart."Before leaving him she pleaded: "Do not make much of
my danger to mamma.She is nervous, and not over-fond of the country at
best.You know that a good many people survive in the country," she
concluded, with a smile that was so winning and disarming that he shook
his head at her as he replied:

"Well, Trurie, I foresee what a lovingly obstinate little girl you are
likely to prove.I think I may as well tell you first as last that you
may count on me in all that is fairly rational.If, with my years and
experience, I can be so considerate, may I hope that you will be also?"Her answer was reassuring, and she went to tell her mother.Fred was quite as confidential with his mother as she with
her father, and the boy had been wild to horrify Mrs.Hargrove by an
account of his sister's adventure.The injunction laid upon him had been
only for the previous evening, and Gertrude found her mother almost
hysterical over the affair, and less inclined to commend Burt than to
blame him as the one who had led her daughter into such "wild,
harum-scarum experiences.""It's always the way," she exclaimed, "when one goes out of one's own
natural associations in life.""I've not been out of my natural associations," Gertrude answered, hotly."The Cliffords are as well-bred and respectable as we are;" and she went
to her room.It was a long, dismal day for her, but, as she had said to her father,
she would not permit herself to drift.Her nature was too positive for
idle, sentimental dreaming.Feeling that she was approaching one of the
crises of her life, she faced it resolutely and intelligently.She went
over the past weeks from the time she had first met Burt under the Gothic
willow arch, and tried to analyze not only the power he had over her, but
also the man himself."I have claimed to papa that I am a woman, and I
should act like one," she thought.Her interest
in Burt had been a purely natural growth, the unsought result of
association with one who had proved congenial.He was so handsome, so
companionable, so vital with spirit and mirthfulness, that his simple
presence was exhilarating, and he had won his influence like the sun in
spring-time.Had he the higher qualities of manhood, those that could
sustain her in the inevitable periods when life would be no laughing
matter?Could he meet the winter of life as well as the summer?She felt
that she scarcely knew him well enough to be sure of this, but she was
still sufficiently young and romantic to think, "If he should ever love
me as I can love him, I could bring out the qualities that papa fears are
lacking."His courage seemed an earnest of all that she could desire.Amy's feeling toward him, and the question whether he had ever regarded
her in another light than that of a sister, troubled her the most.Amy's
assurance of implicit trust, and her promise to deserve it, appeared to
stand directly in her path, and before that stormy day closed she had
reached the calmness of a fixed resolution."If Amy loves him, and he has
given her reason to do so, I shall not come between them, cost me what it
may.I'll do without happiness rather than snatch it from a friend who
has not only spoken her trust, but proved it."Therefore, although her heart gave a great bound as she saw Burt riding
toward the house in the late afternoon, she went to her father and said:
"Mr.I wish you would be present during his call."The young fellow was received cordially, and Mr.Hargrove acknowledged
his indebtedness so feelingly that Burt flushed like a girl, and was
greatly embarrassed.He soon recovered himself, however, and chatted in
his usual easy and spirited way.Before he left he asked, hesitatingly,
"Would you like a souvenir of our little episode yesterday?"and took
from his pocket the rattles of the snake he had killed."It was not a little episode," Gertrude replied, gravely."I shall indeed
value the gift, for it will remind me that I have a friend who did not
count the cost in trying to help me."Impetuous words rose to Burt's lips, but he checked them in time.Trembling for his resolutions, he soon took his departure, and rode
homeward in deeper disquiet than he had ever known.He gave Amy her
friend's messages, and he also, in spite of himself, afforded her a
clearer glimpse of what was passing in his mind than she had received
before."I might have learned to love him in time, I suppose," she
thought, bitterly, "but it's impossible now.I shall build my future on
no such uncertain foundation, and I shall punish him a little, too, for
it's time he had a lesson."CHAPTER XLVII

DISQUIET WITHIN AND WITHOUT


Amy would scarcely have been human had she felt otherwise, for it
appeared that Burt was in a fair way to inflict a slight that would touch
the pride of the gentlest nature.During her long residence abroad Amy
had in a general and unthinking way adopted some English ideas on the
subject of marriage.Burt had at first required what was unnatural and
repugnant, and she had resented the demand that she should pass from an
age and a state of feeling slightly removed from childhood to relations
for which she was not ready.When he had sensibly recognized his error,
and had appeared content to wait patiently and considerately, she had
tacitly assented to his hopes and those of his parents.Her love and
gratitude toward the latter influenced her powerfully, and she saw no
reason why she should disappoint them.But she was much too high-spirited
a girl to look with patience on any wavering in Burt.She had not set her
heart on him or sought to be more to him than to a brother, and if he
wished for more he must win and hold the right by undoubted loyalty.The
fact that Amy had been brought into the Clifford family as a daughter and
sister had not cheated Nature a moment, as both Burt and Webb had proved.She was not their sister, and had unconsciously evoked from each of the
young men a characteristic regard.He had to contend with a temperament not uncommon--one that renders its
possessor highly susceptible to the beauty and fascination of women.He
was as far removed from the male flirt genus as sincerity is from
falsehood; but his passion for Amy had been more like a manifestation of
a trait than a strong individual preference based on mutual fitness and
helpfulness.Miss Hargrove was more truly his counterpart.She could
supplement the weaknesses and defects of his character more successfully
than Amy, and in a vague way he felt this.With all the former's vivacity
there was much reserve strength and magnetism.She was unusually gifted
with will power, and having once gained an influence over a person, she
would have, as agents to maintain it, not only her beauty, but tact, keen
insight and a very quick intelligence.Although true herself, she was by
no means unsophisticated, and having once comprehended Burt's character,
she would have the power, possessed by few others, to make the most of
him.She would first attract unconsciously, like a
rare and beautiful flower, and the loveliness and fragrance of her life
would be undying.Burt had felt her charm, and responded most decisively;
but the tranquil regard of her unawakened heart had little power to
retain and deepen his feeling.She bloomed on at his side, sweet to him,
sweet to all.In Miss Hargrove's dark eyes lurked a stronger spell, and
he almost dared to believe that they had revealed to him a love of which
he began to think Amy was not capable.On the generous young fellow,
whose intentions were good, this fact would have very great influence,
and in preserving her supremacy Miss Hargrove would also be able to
employ not a little art and worldly wisdom.The events that are most desired do not always happen, however, and poor
Burt felt that he had involved himself in complications of which he saw
no solution; while Amy's purpose to give him "a lesson" promised anything
but relief.Her plan involved scarcely any change in her manner toward
him.She would simply act as if she believed all that he had said, and
take it for granted that his hopes for the future were unchanged.She
proposed, however, to maintain this attitude only long enough to teach
him that it is not wise, to say the least, to declare undying devotion
too often to different ladies.The weather during the night and early on the following morning was
puzzling.It might be that the storm was passing, and that the ragged
clouds which still darkened the sky were the rear-guard or the stragglers
that were following the sluggish advance of its main body; or it might be
that there was a partial break in Nature's forces, and that heavier
cloud-masses were still to come.Clifford inclined to the latter
view."Old Storm King is still shrouded," he said at the breakfast-table,
"and this heavy, sultry air does not indicate clearing weather."Nature seemed bent on repeating the
programme of the preceding day, with the purpose of showing how much more
she could do on the same line of action.There was no steady wind from
any quarter.Converging or conflicting currents in the upper air may have
brought heavy clouds together in the highlands to the southwest, for
although the rain began to fall heavily, it could not account for the
unprecedented rise of the streams.In little over an hour there was a
continuous roar of rushing water.Burt, restless and almost reckless,
went out to watch the floods.He soon returned to say that every bridge
on the place had gone, and that what had been dry and stony channels
twenty-four hours before were now filled with resistless torrents.Webb also put on his rubber suit, and they went down the main street
toward the landing.This road, as it descended through a deep valley to
the river, was bordered by a stream that drained for some miles the
northwestern <DW72> of the mountains.For weeks its rocky bed had been
dry; now it was filled with a river yellow as the Tiber.One of the main
bridges across it was gone, and half of the road in one place had been
scooped out and carried away by the furious waters.People were removing
their household goods out into the vertical deluge lest they and all they
had should be swept into the river by the torrent that was above their
doorsteps.The main steamboat wharf, at which the "Powell" had touched
but a few hours before, was scarcely passable with boats, so violent was
the current that poured over it.The rise had been so sudden that people
could scarcely realize it, and strange incidents had occurred.A horse
attached to a wagon had been standing in front of a store.A vivid flash
of lightning startled the animal, and he broke away, galloped up a side
street to the spot where the bridge had been, plunged in, was swept down,
and scarcely more than a minute had elapsed before he was back within a
rod or two of his starting-point, crushed and dead.He had noticed that Amy's eyes had followed him
wistfully, and almost reproachfully, as he went out.Nature's mood was
one to inspire awe, and something akin to dread, in even his own mind.She appeared to have lost or to have relaxed her hold upon her forces.It
seemed that the gathered stores of moisture from the dry, hot weeks of
evaporation were being thrown recklessly away, regardless of consequences.There was no apparent storm-centre, passing steadily to one quarter of the
heavens, but on all sides the lightning would leap from the clouds, while
mingling with the nearer and louder peals was the heavy and continuous
monotone from flashes below the horizon.He was glad he had returned, for he found Amy pale and nervous indeed.Johnnie had been almost crying with terror, and had tremblingly asked her
mother if Noah's flood could come again."If there was to be another flood,
grandpa would have been told to build an ark;" and this assurance had
appeared so obviously true that the child's fears were quieted.Even
Leonard's face was full of gloom and foreboding, when the children were
not present, as he looked out on flooded fields, and from much experience
estimated the possible injury to the farm and the town.They had attained a peace which was not
easily disturbed, and the old gentleman remarked: "I have seen a worse
storm even in this vicinity."But this deluge isn't over," was the reply."It seems a tremendous
reaction from the drought, and where it will end it is hard to tell,
unless this steady downpouring slackens soon."Leonard's fears were not realized, however.The unusual and tropical
manifestations of the storm at last ceased, and by night the rain fell
softly and gently, as if Nature were penitent over her wild passion.The
results of it, however, were left in all directions.Many roads were
impassable; scores of bridges were gone.The passengers from the evening
boats were landed on a wharf partially submerged, and some were taken in
boats to a point whence they could reach their carriages.In the elements' disquiet Burt had found an excuse for his own, and he
had remained out much of the day.He had not called on Miss Hargrove
again, but had ridden far enough to learn that the bridges in that
direction were safe.All the family had remonstrated with him for his
exposure, and Amy asked him, laughingly, if he had been "sitting on
bridges to keep them from floating away.""You are growing ironical," he answered for he was not in an amiable
mood, and he retired early.CHAPTER XLVIII

IDLEWILD


In the morning Nature appeared to have forgotten both her passion and her
penitence, and smiled serenely over the havoc she had made, as if it were
of no consequence.Amy said, "Let us take the strong rockaway, call for Miss Hargrove, and
visit some of the streams"; and she noted that Burt's assent was too
undemonstrative to be natural.Maggie decided to go also, and take the
children, while Leonard proposed to devote the day to repairing the
damage to the farm, his brothers promising to aid him in the afternoon.When at last the party left their carriage at one of the entrances of
Idlewild, the romantic glen made so famous by the poet Willis, a stranger
might have thought that he had never seen a group more in accord with the
open, genial sunshine.This would be true of Maggie and the children.They thought of that they saw, and uttered all their thoughts.The
solution of one of life's deep problems had come to Maggie, but not to
the others, and such is the nature of this problem that its solution can
usually be reached only by long and hidden processes.Not one of the four
young people was capable of a deliberately unfair policy; all, with the
exception of Amy, were conscious whither Nature was leading them, and she
had thoughts also of which she would not speak.There was no lack of
truth in the party, and yet circumstances had brought about a larger
degree of reticence than of frankness.To borrow an illustration from
Nature, who, after all, was to blame for what was developing in each
heart, a rapid growth of root was taking place, and the flower and fruit
would inevitably manifest themselves in time.Miss Hargrove naturally had
the best command over herself.She had taken her course, and would abide
by it, no matter what she might suffer.Burt had mentally set his teeth,
and resolved that he would be not only true to Amy, but also his old gay
self.Amy, however, was not to be
deceived, and her intuition made it clear that he was no longer her old
happy, contented comrade.But she was too proud to show that her pride
was wounded, and appeared to be her former self.Webb, as usual, was
quiet, observant, and not altogether hopeless.And so this merry party,
innocent, notwithstanding all their hidden thoughts about each other,
went down into the glen, and saw the torrent flashing where the sunlight
struck it through the overhanging foliage.Half-way down the ravine there
was a rocky, wooded plateau from which they had a view of the flood for
some distance, as it came plunging toward them with a force and volume
that appeared to threaten the solid foundations of the place on which
they stood.With a roar of baffled fury it sheered off to the left,
rushed down another deep descent, and disappeared from view.The scene
formed a strange blending of peace and beauty with wild, fierce movement
and uproar.From the foliage above and around them came a soft,
slumberous sound, evoked by the balmy wind that fanned their cheeks.The
ground and the surface of the torrent were flecked with waving, dancing
light and shade, as the sunlight filtered through innumerable leaves, on
some of which a faint tinge of red and gold was beginning to appear.Beneath and through all thundered a dark, resistless tide, fit emblem of
lawless passion that, unchanged, unrestrained by gentle influences,
pursues its downward course reckless of consequences.Although the volume
of water passing beneath their feet was still immense, it was evident
that it had been very much greater."I stood here yesterday afternoon,"
said Burt, "and then the sight was truly grand.""Why, it was raining hard in the afternoon!""Burt seemed even more perturbed than the weather yesterday," Amy
remarked, laughing.We were alarmed
about him, fearing lest he should be washed away, dissolved, or
something.""Do I seem utterly quenched this morning?"he asked, in a light vein, but
flushing deeply."Oh, no, not in the least, and yet it's strange, after so much cold water
has fallen on you.""One is not quenched by such trifles," he replied, a little coldly.They were about to turn away, when a figure sprang out upon a rock, far
up the stream, in the least accessible part of the glen.Alvord, as he stood with folded arms and looked down on
the flood that rushed by on either side of him.He had not seen them, and
no greeting was possible above the sound of the waters.Webb thought as
he carried little Ned up the steep path, "Perhaps, in the mad current, he
sees the counterpart of some period in his past."The bridge across the mouth of Idlewild Brook was gone, and they next
went to the landing.The main wharf was covered with large stones and
gravel, the debris of the flood that had poured over it from the adjacent
stream, whose natural outlet had been wholly inadequate.Then they drove
to the wild and beautiful Mountainville road, that follows the Moodna
Creek for a long distance.They could not proceed very far, however, for
they soon came to a place where a tiny brook had passed under a wooden
bridge.Now there was a great yawning chasm.Not only the bridge, but
tons of earth were gone.The Moodna Creek, that had almost ceased to flow
in the drought, had become a tawny river, and rushed by them with a
sullen roar, flanging over the tide was an old dead tree, on which was
perched a fish-hawk.Even while they were looking at him, and Burt was
wishing for his rifle, the bird swooped downward, plunged into the stream
with a splash, and rose with a fish in his talons.It was an admirable
exhibition of fearlessness and power, and Burt admitted that such a
sportsman deserved to live.CHAPTER XLIX

ECHOES OF A PAST STORM


Miss Hargrove returned to dine with them, and as they were lingering over
the dessert and coffee Webb remarked, "By the way, I think the poet
Willis has given an account of a similar, or even greater, deluge in this
region."He soon returned from the library, and read the following
extracts: "'I do not see in the Tribune or other daily papers any mention
of an event which occupies a whole column on the outside page of the
highest mountain above West Point.An avalanche of earth and stone, which
has seamed from summit to base the tall bluff that abuts upon the Hudson,
forming a column of news visible for twenty miles, has reported a deluge
we have had--a report a mile long, and much broader than Broadway.'"Clifford, "that's the flood of which I spoke
yesterday.It was very local, but was much worse than the one we have
just had.Willis
wrote a good deal about the affair in his letters from Idlewild.Webb, selecting here and there, continued to read: "'We have had a deluge
in the valley immediately around us--a deluge which is shown by the
overthrown farm buildings, the mills, dams, and bridges swept away, the
well-built roads cut into chasms, the destruction of horses and cattle,
and the imminent peril to life.It occurred on the evening of August 1,
and a walk to-day down the valley which forms the thoroughfare to
Cornwall Landing (or, rather, a scramble over its gulfs in the road, its
upset barns and sheds, its broken vehicles, drift lumber, rocks, and
rubbish) would impress a stranger like a walk after the deluge of Noah."'The flood came upon us with scarce half an hour's notice.My venerable
neighbor, of eighty years of age, who had passed his life here, and knows
well the workings of the clouds among the mountains, had dined with us,
but hastened his departure to get home before what looked like a shower,
crossing with his feeble steps the stream whose strongest bridge, an hour
after, was swept away.Another of our elderly neighbors had a much
narrower escape.The sudden rush of water alarmed him for the safety of
an old building he used for his stable, which stood upon the bank of the
small stream usually scarce noticeable as it crosses the street at the
landing.He had removed his horse, and returned to unloose a favorite
dog, but before he could accomplish it the building fell.The single jump
with which he endeavored to clear himself of the toppling rafters threw
him into the torrent, and he was swept headlong toward the gulf which it
had already torn in the wharf on the Hudson.His son and two others
plunged in, and succeeded in snatching him from destruction.Another
citizen was riding homeward, when the solid and strongly embanked road
was swept away before and behind him, and he had barely time to unhitch
his horse and escape, leaving his carriage islanded between the chasms.A
man who was driving with his wife and child along our own wall on the
river-shore had a yet more fearful escape: his horse suddenly forced to
swim, and his wagon set afloat, and carried so violently against a tree
by the swollen current of Idlewild Brook that he and his precious load
were thrown into the water, and with difficulty reached the bank beyond.A party of children who were out huckleberrying on the mountain were
separated from home by the swollen brook, and one of them was nearly
drowned in vainly attempting to cross it.Their parents and friends were
out all night in search of them.An aged farmer and his wife, who had
been to Newburgh, and were returning with their two-horse wagon well
laden with goods, attempted to drive over a bridge as it unsettled with
the current, and were precipitated headlong.The old man caught a sapling
as he went down with the flood, the old woman holding on to his
coat-skirts, and so they struggled until their cries brought assistance.'One large building was completely
disembowelled, and the stream coursed violently between the two halves of
its ruins.'I was stopped,' he writes in another place, 'as I scrambled
along the gorge, by a curious picture for the common highway.The brick
front of the basement of a dwelling-house had been torn off, and the
mistress of the house was on her hands and knees, with her head thrust in
from a rear window, apparently getting her first look down into the
desolated kitchen from which she had fled in the night.A man stood in
the middle of the floor, up to his knees in water, looking round in
dismay, though he had begun to pick up some of the overset chairs and
utensils.The fireplace, with its interrupted supper arrangements, the
dresser, with its plates and pans, its cups and saucers, the closets and
cupboards, with their various stores and provisions, were all laid open
to the road like a sliced watermelon.'""Well," ejaculated Leonard, "we haven't so much cause to complain, after
hearing of an affair like that.I do remember many of my impressions at
the time, now that the event is recalled so vividly, but have forgotten
how so sudden a flood was accounted for.""Willis speaks of it on another page," continued Webb, "as 'the
aggregation of extensive masses of clouds into what is sometimes called a
"waterspout," by the meeting of winds upon the converging edge of our
bowl of highlands.The storm for a whole country was thus concentrated.'I think there must have been yesterday a far heavier fall of water on the
mountains a little to the southeast than we had here.Perhaps the truer
explanation in both instances would be that the winds brought heavy
clouds together or against the mountains in such a way as to induce an
enormous precipitation of vapor into rain.Willis indicates by the
following passage the suddenness of the flood he describes: 'My first
intimation that there was anything uncommon in the brook was the sight of
a gentleman in a boat towing a cow across the meadow under our library
window--a green glade seldom or never flooded.The roar from the foaming
precipices in the glen had been heard by us all, but was thought to be
thunder.'Then he tells how he and his daughter put on their rubber suits
and hastened into the glen.'The chasm,' he writes, 'in which the brook,
in any freshet I had heretofore seen, was still only a deep-down stream,
now seemed too small for the torrent.Those giddy precipices on which the
sky seems to lean as you stand below were the foam-lashed sides of a full
and mighty river.The spray broke through the tops of the full-grown
willows and lindens.As the waves plunged against the cliffs they parted,
and disclosed the trunks and torn branches of the large trees they had
overwhelmed and were bearing away, and the earth- flood, in the
wider places, was a struggling mass of planks, timber, rocks, and
roots--tokens of a tumultuous ruin above, to which the thunder-shower
pouring around us gave but a feeble clew.A heavy-limbed willow, which
overhung a rock on which I had often sat to watch the freshets of spring,
rose up while we looked at it, and with a surging heave, as if lifted by
an earthquake, toppled back, and was swept rushingly away.'""How I would have liked to see it!""I can see it," said Amy, leaning back, and closing her eyes."I can see
it all too vividly.I don't like nature in such moods."Then she took up
the volume, and began turning the leaves, and said: "I've never seen this
book before.Why, it's all about this region, and written before I was
born.Oh dear, here is another chapter of horrors!"and she read: "Close
to our gate, at the door of one of our nearest and most valued
neighbors--a lovely girl was yesterday struck dead by lightning.A friend
who stood with her at the moment was a greater sufferer, in being
prostrated by the same flash, and paralyzed from the waist downward--her
life spared at the cost of tortures inexpressible.'"Webb reached out his hand to take the book from her, but she sprang
aloof, and with dilating eyes read further: "'Misa Gilmour had been
chatting with a handsome boy admirer, but left him to take aside a
confidential friend that she might read her a letter.It was from her
mother, a widow with this only daughter.They passed out of the gate,
crossed the road to be out of hearing, and stood under the telegraph
wire, when the letter was opened.Her lips were scarce parted to read
when the flash came--an arrow of intense light-' Oh, horrible!How can you blame me for fear in a thunderstorm?""Amy," said Webb, now quietly taking the book, "your dread at such times
is constitutional.If there were need, you could face danger as well as
any of us.You would have all a woman's fortitude, and that surpasses
ours.Take the world over, the danger from lightning is exceedingly
slight, and it's not the danger that makes you tremble, but your nervous
organization.""You interpret me kindly," she said, "but I don't see why nature is so
full of horrible things.If Gertrude had been bitten by the snake, she
might have fared even worse than the poor girl of whom I have read."Miss Hargrove could not forbear a swift, grateful glance at Burt."I do not think nature is _full_ of horrible things," Webb resumed."Remember how many showers have cooled the air and made the earth
beautiful and fruitful in this region.In no other instance that I know
anything about has life been destroyed in our vicinity.There is indeed a
side to nature that is full of mystery--the old dark mystery of evil; but
I should rather say it is full of all that is beautiful and helpful.At
least this seems true of our region.I have never seen so much beauty in
all my life as during the past year, simply because I am forming the
habit of looking for it.""Why, Webb," exclaimed Amy, laughing, "I thought your mind was
concentrating on crops and subjects as deep as the ocean.""It would take all the salt of the ocean to save that remark," he
replied; but he beat a rather hasty retreat.Clifford, "you may now dismiss your fears.I
imagine that in our tropical storm summer has passed; and with it
thunder-showers and sudden floods.We may now look forward to two months
of almost ideal weather, with now and then a day that will make a book
and a wood fire all the more alluring."The days passed like bright
smiles, in which, however, lurked the pensiveness of autumn.Slowly
failing maples glowed first with the hectic flush of disease, but
gradually warmer hues stole into the face of Nature, for it is the dying
of the leaves that causes the changes of color in the foliage.CHAPTER L

IMPULSES OF THE HEART


The fall season brought increased and varied labors on the farm and in the
garden.As soon as the ground was dry after the tremendous storm, and its
ravages had been repaired as far as possible, the plows were busy preparing
for winter grain, turnips were thinned out, winter cabbages and
cauliflowers cultivated, and the succulent and now rapidly growing celery
earthed up.The fields of corn were watched, and as fast as the kernels
within the husks--now becoming golden-hued--were glazed, the stalks were
cut and tied in compact shocks.The sooner maize is cut, after it has
sufficiently matured, the better, for the leaves make more nutritious
fodder if cured or dried while still full of sap.From some fields the
shocks were wholly removed, that the land might be plowed and seeded with
grain and grass.Buckwheat, used merely as a green and scavenger crop, was
plowed under as it came into blossom, and that which was sown to mature was
cut in the early morning, while the dew was still upon it, for in the heat
of the day the grain shells easily, and is lost.After drying for a few
days in compact little heaps it was ready for the threshing-machine.Then
the black, angular kernels--promises of many winter breakfasts--were spread
to dry on the barn floor, for if thrown into heaps or bins at this early
stage, they heat badly.The Cliffords had long since learned that the large late peaches, that
mature after the Southern crop is out of the market, are the most
profitable, and almost every day Abram took to the landing a load of
baskets full of downy beauties.An orange grove, with Its deep green
foliage and golden fruit, is beautiful indeed, but an orchard laden with
Crawford's Late, in their best development, can well sustain comparison.Sharing the honors and attention given to the peaches were the Bartlett
and other early pears.These latter fruits were treated in much the same
way as the former.The trees were picked over every few days, and the
largest and ripest specimens taken, their maturity being indicated by the
readiness of the stem to part from the spray when the pear is lifted.The
greener and imperfect fruit was left to develop, and the trees, relieved
of much of their burden, were able to concentrate their forces on what
was left.The earlier red grapes, including the Delaware, Brighton, and
Agawam, not only furnished the table abundantly, but also a large surplus
for market.Indeed, there was high and dainty feasting at the Cliffords'
every day--fruit everywhere, hanging temptingly within reach, with its
delicate bloom untouched, untarnished.The storm and the seasonable rains that followed soon restored its
fulness and beauty to Nature's withered face.The drought had brought to
vegetation partial rest and extension of root growth, and now, with the
abundance of moisture, there was almost a spring-like revival.The grass
sprang up afresh, meadows and fields grew green, and annual weeds, from
seeds that had matured in August, appeared by the million."I am glad to see them," Webb remarked."Before they can mature any seed
the frost will put an end to their career of mischief, and there will be
so many seeds less to grow next spring.""There'll be plenty left," Leonard replied.The Cliffords, by their provident system of culture, had prepared for
droughts as mariners do for storms, and hence they had not suffered so
greatly as others; but busy as they were kept by the autumnal bounty of
Nature, and the rewards of their own industry, they found time for
recreation, and thoughts far removed from the material questions of
profit and loss.The drama of life went on, and feeling, conviction, and
love matured like the ripening fruits, although not so openly.As soon as
his duties permitted, Burt took a rather abrupt departure for a hunting
expedition in the northern woods, and a day or two later Amy received a
note from Miss Hargrove, saying that she had accepted an invitation to
join a yachting party.she exclaimed, "I wish you were not so awfully busy all the
time.Here I am, thrown wholly on your tender mercies, and I am neither a
crop nor a scientific subject."The increasing coolness and
exhilarating vitality of the air made not only labor agreeable, but
out-door sports delightful, and he found time for an occasional gallop,
drive, or ramble along roads and lanes lined with golden-rod and purple
asters; and these recreations had no other drawback than the uncertainty
and anxiety within his heart.The season left nothing to be desired, but
the outer world, even in its perfection, is only an accompaniment of
human life, which is often in sad discord with it.Nature, however, is a harmony of many and varied strains, and the unhappy
are always conscious of a deep minor key even on the brightest days.To
Alf and Johnnie the fall brought unalloyed joy and promise; to those who
were older, something akin to melancholy, which deepened with the autumn
of their life; while to Mr.Alvord every breeze was a sigh, every rising
wind a mournful requiem, and every trace of change a reminder that his
spring and summer had passed forever, leaving only a harvest of bitter
memories.Far different was the dreamy pensiveness with which Mr.Clifford looked back upon their vanished youth and maturity.At the
same time they felt within themselves the beginnings of an immortal
youth.Although it was late autumn with them, not memory, but hope, was
in the ascendant.During damp or chilly days, and on the evenings of late September, the
fire burned cheerily on the hearth of their Franklin stove.The old
gentleman had a curious fancy in regard to his fire-wood.He did not want
the straight, shapely sticks from their mountain land, but gnarled and
crooked billets, cut from trees about the place that had required pruning
and removal."I have associations with such fuel" he said, "and can usually recall the
trees--many of which I planted--from which it came; and as I watch it
burn and turn into coals, I see pictures of what happened many years
ago."One evening he threw on the fire a worm-eaten billet, the sound part of
which was as red as mahogany; then drew Amy to him and said, "I once sat
with your father under the apple-tree of which that piece of wood was a
part, and I can see him now as he then looked."She sat down beside him, and said, softly, "Please tell me how he
looked."In simple words the old man portrayed the autumn day, the fruit as golden
as the sunshine, a strong, hopeful man, who had passed away in a
far-distant land, but who was still a living presence to both.Amy looked
at the picture in the flickering blaze until her eyes were blinded with
tears.But such drops fall on the heart like rain and dew, producing
richer and more beautiful life.The pomp and glory of October were ushered in by days of such surpassing
balminess and brightness that it was felt to be a sin to remain indoors.The grapes had attained their deepest purple, and the apples in the
orchard vied with the brilliant and varied hues of the fast-turning
foliage.The nights were soft, warm, and resonant with the unchecked
piping of insects.From every tree and shrub the katydids contradicted
one another with increasing emphasis, as if conscious that the time was
at hand when the last word must be spoken.The stars glimmered near
through a delicate haze, and in the western sky the pale crescent of the
moon was so inclined that the old Indian might have hung upon it his
powder-horn.On such an evening the young people from the Cliffords' had gathered on
Mr.Hargrove's piazza, and Amy and Gertrude were looking at the new moon
with silver in their pockets, each making her silent wish.Amy had to think before deciding what she wanted most, but
not Miss Hargrove.Her face has grown thinner and paler during the last
few weeks; there is unwonted brilliancy in her eyes to-night, but her
expression is resolute.Times of
weakness, if such they could be called, would come, but they should not
appear in Burt's or Amy's presence.The former had just returned, apparently gayer than ever.His face was
bronzed from his out-door life in the Adirondacks.Its expression was
also resolute, and his eyes turned oftenest toward Amy, with a determined
loyalty.As has been said, not long after the experiences following the
storm, he had yielded to his impulse to go away and recover his poise.He
felt that if he continued to see Miss Hargrove frequently he might reveal
a weakness which would lead not only Amy to despise him, but also Miss
Hargrove, should she become aware of the past.As he often took such
outings, the family, with the exception of Webb and Amy, thought nothing
of it.His brother and the girl he had wooed so passionately now
understood him well enough to surmise his motive, and Amy had thought,
"It will do him good to go away and think awhile, but it will make no
difference; this new affair must run its course also."And yet her heart
began to relent toward him after a sisterly fashion.She wondered if Miss
Hargrove did regard him as other than a friend to whom she owed very
much.If so, she smiled at the idea of standing in the way of their
mutual happiness.She had endured his absence with exceeding tranquillity,
for Webb had given her far more of his society, and she, Alf, and Johnnie
often went out and aided him in gathering the fruit.For some reason these
light tasks had been more replete with quiet enjoyment than deliberate
pleasure-seeking.Burt had been at pains to take, in Amy's presence, a most genial and
friendly leave of Miss Hargrove, but there was no trace of the lover in
his manner.His smiles and cordial words had chilled her heart, and had
strengthened the fear that in some way he was bound to Amy.She knew that
she had fascinated and perhaps touched him deeply, but imagined she saw
indications of an allegiance that gave little hope for the future.If he
felt as she did, and were free, he would not have gone away; and when he
had gone, time grew leaden-footed.Absence is the touchstone, and by its
test she knew that her father was right, and that she, to whom so much
love had been given unrequited, had bestowed hers apparently in like
manner.Then had come an invitation to join a yachting party to Fortress
Monroe, and she had eagerly accepted.With the half-reckless impulse of
pride, she had resolved to throw away the dream that had promised so
much, and yet had ended in such bitter and barren reality.She would
forget it all in one brief whirl of gayety; and she had been the
brilliant life of the party.But how often her laugh had ended in a
stifled sigh!How often her heart told her, "This is not happiness, and
never can be again!"Her brief experience of what is deep and genuine in
life taught her that she had outgrown certain pleasures of the past, as a
child outgrows its toys, and she had returned thoroughly convinced that
her remedy was not in the dissipations of society.The evening after her return Burt, with Webb and Amy, had come to call,
and as she looked upon him again she asked herself, in sadness, "Is there
any remedy?"She was not one to give her heart in a half-way manner.It seemed to her that he had been absent for years, and had grown
indefinitely remote.Never before had she gained the impression so
strongly that he was in some way bound to Amy, and would abide by his
choice.If this were true, she felt that the sooner she left the vicinity
the better, and even while she chatted lightly and genially she was
planning to induce her father to return to the city at an early date.Before parting, Amy spoke of her pleasure at the return of her friend,
who, she said, had been greatly missed, adding: "Now we shall make up for
lost time.The roads are in fine condition for horseback exercise,
nutting expeditions will soon be in order, and we have a bee-hunt on the
programme.""I congratulate you on your prospects," said Miss Hargrove."I wish I
could share in all your fun, but fear I shall soon return to the city."Burt felt a sudden chill at these words, and a shadow from them fell
across his face.Webb saw their effect, and he at once entered on a
rather new role for him."Then we must make the most of the time before
you go," he began."I propose we take advantage of this weather and drive
over to West Point, and lunch at Fort Putnam.""Why, Webb, what a burst of genius!"Let us go to-morrow for we can't count on such weather
long."The temptation was indeed strong, but she felt
it would not be wise to yield, and began, hesitatingly, "I fear my
engagements--" At this moment she caught a glimpse of Burt's face in a
mirror, and saw the look of disappointment which he could not disguise."If I return to the city soon," she resumed, "I ought to be at my
preparations.""Why, Gertrude," said Amy, "I almost feel as if you did not wish to go.I thought you were to remain in the country till
November.I have been planning so much that we could do together!""Surely, Miss Hargrove," added Burt, with a slight tremor in his voice,
"you cannot nip Webb's genius in the very bud.Such an expedition as he
proposes is an inspiration.""But you can do without me," she replied, smiling on him bewilderingly.It was a light arrow, but its aim was true.Never before had he so felt
the power of her beauty, the almost irresistible spell of her fascination.While her lips were smiling, there was an expression in her dark eyes that
made her words, so simple and natural in themselves, a searching question,
and he could not forbear saying, earnestly, "We should all enjoy the
excursion far more if you went with us.""Truly, Miss Hargrove," said Webb, "I shall be quenched if you decline,
and feel that I have none of the talent for which I was beginning to gain
a little credit.""I cannot resist such an appeal as that, Mr.Clifford," she said,
laughingly."I anticipate a marvellous day
to-morrow.Bring Fred also, and let us all vie with each other in
encouraging Webb.""Has that quiet Webb any scheme in his mind?"Miss Hargrove thought,
after they had gone."I wish that tomorrow might indeed be 'a marvellous
day' for us all."An affirmative
answer was slow in coming, though he thought long and late.CHAPTER LI

WEBB'S FATEFUL EXPEDITION


Mr.Hargrove had welcomed the invitation that took his daughter among
some of her former companions, hoping that a return to brilliant
fashionable life would prove to her that she could not give it up.It was
his wish that she should marry a wealthy man of the city.His wife did
not dream of any other future for her handsome child, and she looked
forward with no little complacency to the ordering of a new and elegant
establishment.At the dinner-table Gertrude had given a vivacious account of her
yachting experience, and all had appeared to promise well; but when she
went to the library to kiss her father good-night, he looked at her
inquiringly, and said, "You enjoyed every moment, I suppose?"She shook her head sadly, and, after a moment, said: "I fear I've grown
rather tired of that kind of thing.We made much effort to enjoy
ourselves.Is there not a happiness which comes without so much effort?""I'm sorry," he said, simply.Suppose I find more pleasure in staying with
you than in rushing around?""I think it would be less contrary to _my_ nature than forced gayety
among people I care nothing about."He smiled at her fondly, but admitted to himself that absence had
confirmed the impressions of the summer, instead of dissipating them, and
that if Burt became her suitor he would be accepted.When she looked out on the morning of the excursion to Fort Putnam it was
so radiant with light and beauty that hope sprang up within her heart.Disappointment that might last through life could not come on a day like
this.Silvery mists ascended from the river down among the Highlands.The
lawn and many of the fields were as green as they had been in June, and
on every side were trees like immense bouquets, so rich and varied was
their coloring.There was a dewy freshness in the air, a genial warmth in
the sunshine, a spring-like blue in the sky; and in these was no
suggestion that the November of her life was near."And yet it may be,"
she thought."I must soon face my fate, and I must be true to Amy."Hargrove regarded with discontent the prospect of another long
mountain expedition; but Fred, her idol, was wild for it, and in a day or
two he must return to school in the city, from which, at his earnest
plea, he had been absent too long already; so she smiled her farewell at
last upon the fateful excursion.He, with his sister, was soon at the Cliffords', and found the
rockaway--the strong old carryall with which Gertrude already had tender
associations--in readiness.Maggie had agreed to chaperon the party,
little Ned having been easily bribed to remain with his father.Miss Hargrove had looked wistfully at the Clifford mansion as she drew
near to it.Never had it appeared to her more home-like, with its
embowering trees and laden orchards.The bright hues of the foliage
suggested the hopes that centred there: the ocean, as she had seen
it--cold and gray under a clouded sky--was emblematic of life with no
fulfilment of those hopes.Clifford met her at the door, and
took her in to see the invalid, who greeted her almost as affectionately
as she would have welcomed Amy after absence, Miss Hargrove knew in the
depths of her heart how easily she could be at home there.Never did a pleasure-party start under brighter auspices.Clifford came out, on her husband's arm, to wave them a farewell.The young men had their alpenstocks, for it was their intention to walk
up the steep places.Webb was about to take Alf and Johnnie on the front
seat with him, when Amy exclaimed: "I'm going to drive, Mr.Johnnie
can sit between us, and keep me company when you are walking.You needn't
think that because you are the brilliant author of this expedition you
are going to have everything your own way."Indeed, not a little guile lurked behind her laughing eyes, which ever
kept Webb in perplexity--though he looked into them so often--as to
whether they were blue or gray.Miss Hargrove demurely took her seat with
Maggie, and Burt had the two boys with him.Fred had brought his gun, and
was vigilant for game now that the "law was up."They soon reached the foot of the mountain, and there was a general
unloading, for at first every one wished to walk.Maggie good-naturedly
climbed around to the front seat and took the reins, remarking that she
would soon have plenty of company again.Burt had not recognized Amy's tactics, nor did he at once second them,
even unconsciously.His long ruminations had led to the only possible
conclusion--the words he had spoken must be made good.Pride and honor
permitted no other course.Therefore he proposed to-day to be ubiquitous,
and as gallant to Maggie as to the younger ladies.When Miss Hargrove
returned to the city he would quietly prove his loyalty.Never before had
he appeared in such spirits; never so inexorably resolute.He recalled
Amy's incredulous laugh at his protestation of constancy, and felt that
he could never look her in the face if he faltered.It was known that
Miss Hargrove had received much attention, and her interest in him would
be likely to disappear at once should she learn of his declaration of
undying devotion to another but a few months before.He anathematized
himself, but determined that his weakness should remain unknown.It was
evident that Amy had been a little jealous, but probably that she did not
yet care enough for him to be very sensitive on the subject.He had pledged himself to wait until she did care.Miss Hargrove should be made
to believe that she had added much to the pleasure of the excursion, and
there he would stop.And Burt on his mettle was no bungler.The test
would come in his staying powers.Webb, however, was quietly serene.He had not watched and thought so long
in vain.He had seen Burt's expression the evening before, and knew that
a wakeful night had followed.His own feeling had taught him a
clairvoyance which enabled him to divine not a little of what was passing
in his brother's mind and that of Miss Hargrove.Her frank, sisterly affection was not love, and might never
become love.One of the objects of the expedition was to obtain an abundant supply of
autumn leaves and ferns for pressing."I intend to make the old house
look like a bower this winter," Amy remarked."That would be impossible with our city home," Miss Hargrove said, "and
mamma would not hear of such an attempt.But I can do as I please in my
own room, and shall gather my country _souvenirs_ to-day."The idea of decorating her apartment with feathery ferns and bright-hued
leaves took a strong hold upon her fancy, for she hoped that Burt would
aid her in making the collection.Nor was she disappointed, for Amy said:

"Burt, I have gathered and pressed nearly all the ferns I need already.You know the shady nooks where the most delicate ones grow, and you can
help Gertrude make as good a collection as mine.You'll help too, won't
you, Webb?"added the innocent little schemer, who saw that Burt was
looking at her rather keenly.So they wound up the mountain, making long stops here and there to gather
sylvan trophies and to note the fine views.Amy's manner was so cordial
and natural that Burt's suspicions had been allayed, and the young
fellow, who could do nothing by halves, was soon deeply absorbed in
making a superb collection for Miss Hargrove, and she felt that, whatever
happened, she was being enriched by everything he obtained for her.Amy
had brought a great many newspapers folded together so that leaves could
be placed between the pages, and Webb soon noted that his offerings were
kept separate from those of Burt.The latter tried to be impartial in his
labors in behalf of the two girls, bringing Amy bright-hued leaves
instead of ferns, but did not wholly succeed, and sometimes he found
himself alone with Miss Hargrove as they pursued their search a short
distance on some diverging and shaded path.On one of these occasions he
said, "I like to think how beautiful you will make your room this
winter.""I like to think of it too," she replied."I shall feel that I have a
part of my pleasant summer always present.""Yes, the pleasantest I ever enjoyed.""I should think you would find it exceedingly dull after such brilliant
experiences as that of your yachting excursion.""Do you find to-day exceedingly dull?""But I am used to the quiet country, and a day like this is the
exception.""I do not imagine you have ever lived a tame life.""Isn't that about the same as calling me wild?""There's no harm in beginning a little in that way."You are so favored that I can scarcely imagine life bringing sobering
experiences to you very soon."Have you forgotten what occurred on these very mountains, at no
great distance?I assure you I never forget it;" and her eyes were
eloquent as she turned them upon him."One does not forget the most fortunate event of one's life.Since you
were to meet that danger, I would not have missed being near for the
world.I had even a narrower escape, as you know, on this mountain.The
spot where Webb found me is scarcely more than a mile away."She looked at him very wistfully, and her face grew pale, but she only
said, "I don't think either of us can forget the Highlands.""I shall never forget that little path," he said, in a low tone, and he
looked back at it lingeringly as they came out into the road and
approached the rest of the party.That
spot should be marked for future supplies.Miss Hargrove will share with
you, for you can't have anything so fine as this.""Yes, indeed I have, and I shall call you and Webb to account if you do
not to-day make Gertrude fare as well."Both Miss Hargrove and Burt were bewildered.There was lurking mischief
in Amy's eyes when she first spoke, and yet she used her influence to
keep Burt in her friend's society.Her spirits seemed too exuberant to be
natural, and Miss Hargrove, who was an adept at hiding her feelings under
a mask of gayety, surmised that Amy's feminine instincts had taught her
to employ the same tactics.Conscious of their secret, Miss Hargrove and
Burt both thought, "Perhaps it is her purpose to throw us together as far
as possible, and learn the truth."Amy had a kinder purpose than they imagined.She wanted no more of Burt's
forced allegiance, and was much too good-natured to permit mere pique to
cause unhappiness to others."Let Gertrude win him if she cares for him,"
was her thought, "and if _she_ can't hold him his case is
_hopeless_."She could not resist the temptation, however, to tease
Burt a little.But he gave her slight chance for the next few hours.Her mirthful
question and the glance accompanying it had put him on his guard again,
and he at once became the gay cavalier-general he had resolved on being
throughout the day.They made a long pause to enjoy the view looking out upon Constitution
Island, West Point, the southern mountains, and the winding river, dotted
here and there with sails, and with steamers, seemingly held motionless
by their widely separated train of canal boats."What mountain is this that we are now to descend?""It's the first high mountain that abuts on
the river above West Point, you will remember."I have a song relating to it, and will give you a
verse;" and she sang:

  "'Where Hudson's waves o'er silvery sands
      Wind through the hills afar,
    And Cro' Nest like a monarch stands,
      Crowned with a single star.'"After a round of applause had subsided, Burt, whose eyes had been more
demonstrative than his hands, said, "That's by Morris.We can see from
Fort Putnam his old home under Mount Taurus."He is the poet who entreated the woodman to'spare that tree.'""Which the woodman will never do," Webb remarked, "unless compelled by
law; nor even then, I fear."cried Amy, "with what a thump you drop into prose!""I also advise an immediate descent of the mountain if we are to have any
time at Fort Putnam," he added.They were soon winding down the S's by which the road overcame the steep
declivity.On reaching a plateau, before the final descent, they came
across a wretched hovel, gray and storm-beaten, with scarcely strength to
stand.Rags took the place of broken glass in the windows.A pig was
rooting near the doorstep, on which stood a slatternly woman, regarding
the party with dull curiosity."Talk about the elevating influence of mountain scenery," said Miss
Hargrove; "there's a commentary on the theory.""The theory's correct," persisted Burt."Their height above tide-water
and the amount of bad whiskey they consume keep our mountaineers elevated
most of the time.""Does Lumley live in a place like that?""He did--in a worse one, if possible," Webb replied for Amy, who
hesitated."But you should see how it is changed.He now has a good
vegetable garden fenced in, a rustic porch covered with American ivy,
and--would you believe it?--an actual flower-bed.Within the hut there
are two pictures on the wall, and the baby creeps on a carpeted floor.Lumley says Amy is making a man of him.""You forget to mention how much you have helped me," Amy added."Come, let us break up this mutual admiration society," said Burt."I'm
ready for lunch already, and Fort Putnam is miles away."The road from the foot of the mountain descends gradually through wild,
beautiful scenery to West Point.Cro' Nest rises abruptly on the left,
and there is a wooded valley on the right, with mountains beyond.The
trees overhung the road with a canopy of gold, emerald, and crimson
foliage, and the sunlight came to the excursionists as through
stained-glass windows.Taking a side street at the back of the military
post, they soon reached a point over which frowned the ruins of the fort,
and here they left their horses.After a brief climb to the northward
they entered on an old road, grass-grown and leaf-carpeted, and soon
passed through the gaping sally-port, on either side of which cone-like
cedars stood as sentinels.Within the fort Nature had been busy for a
century softening and obliterating the work of man.Cedar trees--some of
which were dying from age--grew everywhere, even on the crumbling
ramparts.Except where ledges of the native rock cropped out, the ground
was covered with a thick sward.Near the centre of the inclosure is the
rocky basin.In it bubbles the spring at which the more temperate of the
ancient garrison may have softened the asperities of their New England
rum.The most extensive ruins are seen by turning sharply to the left from the
sally-port.Here, yawning like caverns, their entrances partially choked
by the debris, are six casemates, or vaults.They were built of brick,
covered with stone, and are eighteen feet deep and twelve wide, with an
arched roof twelve feet high.On the level rampart above them were long,
withered grass, the wild dwarf-rose, and waving golden-rod.The outer
walls, massy and crumbling, or half torn away by vandal hands, were built
in angles, according to the engineering science of the Revolution, except
on the west, where the high ramparts surmount a mural perpendicular
precipice fifty feet in height.Inland, across the valley, the mountains
were seen, rising like rounded billows in every direction, while from the
north, east, and south the windings of the Hudson were visible for
fifteen miles.All but Amy had visited the spot before, and Burt explored the place with
her while the rest prepared for lunch.She had asked Gertrude to
accompany them, but the latter had sought refuge with Maggie, and at her
side she proposed to remain.She scarcely dared trust herself with Burt,
and as the day advanced he certainly permitted his eyes to express an
interest that promised ill for his inexorable purpose of constancy.It had become clear to Miss Hargrove that he was restrained by something
that had occurred between him and Amy, and both her pride and her sense
of truth to her friend decided her to withdraw as far as possible from
his society, and to return to the city.She and Burt vied with each other in gayety at lunch.When it was over
they all grouped themselves in the shade of a clump of cedars, and looked
away upon the wide prospect, Webb pointing out objects of past and
present interest.Alf and Fred speedily grew restless and started off
with the gun, Johnnie's head sank into her mother's lap, Miss Hargrove
and Burt grew quiet and preoccupied, their eyes looking off into vacancy.Webb was saying, "By one who had imagination how much more could be seen
from this point than meets the eye!There, on the plain below us, would
rise the magnificent rustic colonnade two hundred and twenty feet long
and eighty feet wide, beneath which Washington gave the great banquet in
honor of the birth of the Dauphin of France, and on the evening of the
same day these hills blazed with musketry and rolled back the thunder of
cannon with which the festivities of the evening were begun.Think of the
'Father of his Country' being there in flesh and blood, just as we are
here!In the language of an old military journal, 'He carried down a
dance of twenty couple on the green grass, with a graceful and dignified
air, having Mrs.In almost a direct line across
the river you can see the Beverly Robinson house, from which Arnold
carried on his correspondence with Andre.You can look into the window of
the room to which, after hearing of the capture of Andre, he hastened
from the breakfast-table.To this upper room he immediately summoned his
wife, who had been the beautiful Margaret Shippen, you remember, and told
her of his awful peril, then rushed away, leaving the poor, terror-stricken
woman unconscious on the floor.Would you not like to look through the
glass at the house where the tragedy occurred, Miss Hargrove?"At the sound of her name the young girl started visibly, and Webb saw
that there were tears in her eyes; but she complied without a word, and
he so directed the glass that it covered the historic mansion.thought innocent Webb, taking her
quickly suppressed emotion as a tribute to his moving reminiscences."Oh, Webb, have done with your lugubrious ancient history!"cried Burt,
springing up."It's time we were getting ready for a homeward move," said Maggie."I'll
go and pack the things.""And I'll help you," added Miss Hargrove, hastily following her."Let me look at the house, too," said Amy, taking the glass; then added,
after a moment: "Poor Margaret Arnold!It was indeed a tragedy, as you
said, Webb--a sadder one than these old military preparations can
suggest.In all his career of war and treachery Arnold never inflicted a
more cruel wound.""How much feeling Miss Hargrove showed!""Yes," said Amy, quietly, "she was evidently feeling deeply."Her thought
was, "I don't believe she heard a word that Webb said."Then, seeing that
Burt was helping Maggie and Miss Hargrove, she added, "Please point out
to me some other interesting places."Webb, well pleased, talked on to a listener who did not give him her
whole attention.She could not forget Gertrude's paleness, and her
alternations from extreme gayety to a look of such deep sadness as to
awaken not a little sympathetic curiosity.Amy loved her friend truly,
and it did not seem strange to her that Miss Hargrove was deeply
interested in Burt, since they had been much thrown together, and since
she probably owed her life to him.Amy's resentment toward Burt had
passed away.She had found that her pride, merely, and not her heart, was
wounded by his new passion, and she already began to feel that she never
could have any such regard for him as her friend was possibly cherishing.Therefore it was, perhaps, not unnatural that her tranquil regard should
prove unsatisfying to Burt in contrast with the passion of which Miss
Hargrove was capable.She had seen his vain efforts to remain loyal, and
had smiled at them, proposing to let matters take their course, and to
give little aid in extricating him from his dilemma.But, if she had
interpreted her friend's face aright, she could no longer stand aloof, an
amused and slightly satirical spectator.If Burt deserved some
punishment, Gertrude did not, and she was inclined to guess the cause of
the latter's haste to return to the city.It may thus be seen that Amy was fast losing her unsophisticated
girlhood.While Burt's passionate words had awakened no corresponding
feeling, they had taught her that she was no longer a child, since she
could inspire such words.Her intimacy with Miss Hargrove, and the
latter's early confidences, had enlarged her ideas on some subjects.As
the bud of a flower passes slowly through long and apparently slow stages
of immaturity and at last suddenly opens to the light, so she had reached
that age when a little experience suggests a great deal, and the
influences around her tended to develop certain thoughts very rapidly.She saw that her friend had not been brought up in English seclusion.Admirers by the score had flocked around her, and, as she had often said,
she proposed to marry for love."I have the name of being cold," she once
told Amy, "but I know I can love as can few others, and I shall know it
well when I do love, too."The truth was daily growing clearer to Amy
that under our vivid American skies the grand passion is not a fiction of
romance or a quiet arrangement between the parties concerned.Miss Hargrove had not misjudged herself.Her tropical nature, when once
kindled, burned with no feeble, wavering flame.She had passed the point
of criticism of Burt.She loved him, and to her fond eyes he seemed more
worthy of her love than any man she had ever before known.But she had
not passed beyond her sense of truth and duty, and the feeling came to
her that she must go away at once and engage in that most pathetic of all
struggles that fall to woman's lot.As the conviction grew clear on this
bright October day, she felt that her heart was bleeding internally.Tears would come into her eyes at the dreary prospect.Her former
brilliant society life now looked as does an opera-house in the morning,
when the gilding and tinsel that flashed and sparkled the evening before
are seen to be dull and tarnished.Burt had appeared to especial
advantage in his mountain home.His
tall, fine figure and unconscious, easy manner were as full of grace as
deficient in conventionality, and she thought with disgust of many of her
former admirers, who were nothing if not stylish after the arbitrary mode
of the hour.At the same time he had proved that he could be at home in a
drawing-room on the simple ground of good-breeding, and not because he
had been run through fashion's latest mold.The grand scenery around her
suggested the manhood that kindled her imagination--a manhood strong,
fearless, and not degenerated from that sturdy age which had made these
scenes historic.By the time they were ready to start homeward the southern side of Cro'
Nest was in deep blue shadow.They bowled along rapidly till they came to
the steep ascent, and then the boys and the young men sprang out."Would
you like to walk, Gertrude?"Amy asked, for she was bent on throwing her
friend and Burt together during the witching twilight that was coming on
apace."I fear I am too tired, unless the load is heavy," she replied."Oh, no, indeed," said Webb."It does not take long to reach the top of
the mountain on this side, and then it's chiefly down hill the rest of
the way."Amy, who had been sitting with Webb and Johnnie as before, said to Miss
Hargrove, "Won't you step across the seats and keep me company?"She was so utterly unhappy that she
wished to be left to herself as far as possible.In her realization of a
loss that seemed immeasurable, she was a little resentful toward Amy,
feeling that she had been more frank and confidential than her friend.If
Amy had claims on Burt, why had she not spoken of them?why had she
permitted her for whom she professed such strong friendship to drift
almost wholly unwarned upon so sad a fate?and why was she now clearly
trying to bring together Burt and the one to whom even he felt that he
had no right to speak in more than a friendly manner?While she was
making such immense sacrifices to be true, she felt that Amy was
maintaining an unfair reticence, if not actually beguiling herself and
Burt into a display of weakness for which they would be condemned--or, at
least, he would be, and love identifies itself with its object.These
thoughts, having once been admitted, grew upon her mind rapidly, for it
is hard to suffer through another and maintain a gentle charity.Therefore she was silent when she took her seat by Amy, and when the
latter gave her a look that was like a caress, she did not return it."You are tired, Gertrude," Amy began gently.You
must stay with me to-night, and I'll watch over you like Sairy Gamp."So far from responding to Amy's playful and friendly words, Miss Hargrove
said, hastily,

"Oh, no, I had better go right on home.I don't feel very well, and shall
be better at home; and I must begin to get ready to-morrow for my return
to the city."Amy would not be repulsed, but, putting her arm around her friend, she
looked into her eyes, and asked:

"Why are you so eager to return to New York?Are you tiring of your
country friends?You certainly told me that you expected to stay till
November.""Fred must go back to school to-morrow," said Gertrude, in a constrained
voice, "and I do not think it is well to leave him alone in the city
house.""You are withdrawing your confidence from me," said Amy, sadly.If you had, I should not be the unhappy girl I am-to-night.Well,
since you wish to know the whole truth you shall.You said you could
trust me implicitly, and I promised to deserve your trust.If you had
said to me that Burt was bound to you when I told you that I was
heart-whole and fancy-free, I should have been on my guard.Is it natural
that I should be indifferent to the man who risked his life to save mine?Why have you left me so long in his society without a hint of warning?I shall not try to snatch happiness from
another."Johnnie's tuneful little voice was piping a song, and the rumble of the
wheels over a stony road prevented Maggie, on the last seat, from hearing
anything."Now you _shall_ stay with me
to-night," she said.See, Burt has
turned, and is coming toward us.I pledge you my word he can never be to
me more than a brother.I do not love him except as a brother, and never
have, and you can snatch no happiness from me, except by treating me with
distrust and going away.""Oh, Amy," began Miss Hargrove, in tones and with a look that gave
evidence of the chaotic bewilderment of her mind.We are not very lonely, thank you, Mr.You look, as far as I
can see you through the dusk, as if you were commiserating us as poor
forlorn creatures, but we have some resources within ourselves."We are the forlorn creatures who have
no resources.I assure you we are very simple,
honest people.""In that case I shall have no fears, but clamber in at once.I feel as if
I had been on a twenty-mile tramp.""What an implied compliment to our exhilarating society!""Indeed there is--a very strong one.I've been so immensely exhilarated
that, in the re-action, I'm almost faint.""Maggie," cried Amy, "do take care of Burt; he's going to faint.""He must wait till we come to the next brook, and then we'll put him in
it.""Webb," said Amy, looking over her shoulder at the young man, who was now
following the carriage, "is there anything the matter with you, also?""Oh, your trouble, whatever it may be, is chronic.Well, well, to think
that we poor women may be the only survivors of this tremendous
expedition.""That would be most natural--the survival of the fittest, you know."Science is uppermost in your mind, as
ever.You ought to live a thousand years, Webb, to see the end of all
your theories.""I fear it wouldn't be the millennium for me, and that I should have more
perplexing theories at its end than now.""That's the way with men--they are never satisfied," remarked Miss
Hargrove.Clifford, this is your expedition, and it's getting so
dark that I shall feel safer if you are driving.""Oh, Gertrude, you have no confidence in me whatever.As if I would break
your neck--or heart either!""You are a very mysterious little woman," was the reply, given in like
manner, "and need hours of explanation."Clifford,
I've much more confidence in you than in Amy.Her talk is so giddy that I
want a sober hand on the reins.""I want one to drive who can see his way, not feel it," was the laughing
response.Amy, too, was laughing silently, as she reined in the horses."What are you
two girls giggling about?""The
idea of two such refined creatures giggling!""Well," exclaimed Webb, "what am I to do?I can't stand up between you
and drive.""Gertrude, you must clamber around and sustain Burt's drooping spirits.""Indeed, Amy, you must know best how to do that," was the reply."As
guest, I claim a little of the society of the commander-in-chief."I'll solve the vexed question," said Burt, much nettled, and leaping
out."Now, Burt, the question isn't vexed, and don't you be," cried Amy,
springing lightly over to the next seat."There are Fred and Alf, too,
with the gun.Let us all get home as soon as possible, for it's nearly
time for supper already.Come, I shall feel much hurt if you don't keep
me company."Burt at once realized the absurdity of showing pique, although he felt
that there was something in the air which he did not understand.He came
back laughing, with much apparent good-nature, and saying, "I thought I'd
soon bring one or the other of you to terms."said Amy, with difficulty restraining a
new burst of merriment.They soon reached the summit, and paused to give the horses a breathing.The young moon hung in the west, and its silver crescent symbolized to
Miss Hargrove the hope that was growing in her heart."Amy," she said,
"don't you remember the song we arranged from 'The Culprit Fay'?We
certainly should sing it here on this mountain.Amy sang, in clear soprano:

  "'The moon looks down on old Cro' Nest,
  She mellows the shades on his shaggy breast,
  And seems his huge gray form to throw
  In a silver cone on the wave below.'""Imagine the cone and wave, please," said Miss Hargrove; and then, in an
alto rich with her heart's deep feeling, she sang with Amy:

  "'Ouphe and goblin!Ye that love the moon's soft light,
    Hither--hither wend your way;
    Twine ye in a jocund ring;
    Sing and trip it merrily,
    Hand to hand and wing to wing,
    Round the wild witch-hazel tree.'""If I were a goblin, I'd come, for music like that," cried Burt, as they
started rapidly homeward."You are much too big to suggest a culprit fay," said Amy."But the description of the fay's charmer is your portrait," he replied,
in a low tone:

  "'But well I know her sinless mind
    Is pure as the angel forms above,
    Gentle and meek, and chaste and kind,
    Such as a spirit well might love.'""Oh, no; you are mistaken, I'm not meek in the least.Think of the
punishment:

  "'Tied to the hornet's shardy wings,
    Toss'd on the pricks of nettles' stings;'

you know the rest.""What witchery has got into you to-night, Amy?""That last song was so good that I, for one, would be glad of more," cried
Webb."You men must help us, then," said Miss Hargrove, and in a moment the wild,
dim forest was full of melody, the rocks and highlands sending back soft
and unheeded echoes.Burt, meantime, was occupied with disagreeable reflections.Perhaps both
the girls at last understood him, and had been comparing notes, to his
infinite disadvantage.His fickleness and the dilemma he was in may have
become a jest between them.Resentment, except against
himself, was impossible.If Amy understood him, in what other way could
she meet any approach to sentiment on his part than by a laughing scorn?If Miss Hargrove had divined the past, or had received a hint concerning
it, why should she not shun his society?He was half-desperate, and yet
felt that any show of embarrassment or anger would only make him appear
more ridiculous.The longer he thought the more sure he was that the
girls were beginning to guess his position, and that his only course was
a polite indifference to both.But this policy promised to lead through a
thorny path, and to what?In impotent rage at himself he ground his teeth
during the pauses between the stanzas that he was compelled to sing.Such
was the discord in his heart that he felt like uttering notes that would
make "night hideous."He was still more distraught when, on their return, they found Mr.Hargrove's carriage in waiting, and Amy, after a brief conference with
her friend in her room, came down prepared to accompany Miss Hargrove
home after supper.In spite of all his efforts at ease and gayety, his
embarrassment and trouble were evident.He had observed Miss Hargrove's
pallor and her effort to keep up at Fort Putnam, and could not banish the
hope that she sympathized with him; but now the young girl was demurely
radiant.Her color had come again, and the lustre of her beautiful eyes
was dazzling.Yet they avoided his, and she had far more to say to Webb
and the others than to him.Webb, too, was perplexed, for during the day
Amy had been as bewildering to him as to Burt.But he was in no
uncertainty as to his course, which was simply to wait.He, with Burt,
saw the girls to the carriage, and the latter said good-night rather
coldly and stiffly.Alf and Fred parted regretfully, with the promise of
a correspondence which would be as remarkable for its orthography as for
its natural history.CHAPTER LII

BURT'S SORE DILEMMA


Mr.Hargrove greeted Amy cordially, but his questioning eyes rested
oftenest on his daughter.Her expression and manner caused him to pace
his study long and late that night.Hargrove was very polite and a
little stately.She felt that she existed on a plane above Amy.The young girls soon pleaded fatigue, and retired.Once in the seclusion
of their room they forgot all about their innocent fib, and there was not
a trace of weariness in their manner.While Burt was staring at his
dismal, tangled fortune, seeing no solution of his difficulties, a
fateful conference relating to him was taking place.Amy did not look
like a scorner, as with a sister's love and a woman's tact she pleaded
his cause and palliated his course to one incapable of harsh judgment.But she felt that she must be honest with her friend, and that the whole
truth would be best and safest.Her conclusion was: "No man who loved
_you_, and whom you encouraged, would ever change.I know now that I
never had a particle of such feeling as you have for Burt, and can see
that I naturally chilled and quenched his regard for me."Miss Hargrove's dark eyes flashed ominously as she spoke of Burt or of
any man proving faithless after she had given encouragement."But it wasn't possible for me to give him any real encouragement," Amy
persisted."I've never felt as you do, and am not sure that I want to for
a long time."Miss Hargrove almost said, but she suppressed the
words, feeling that since he had not revealed his secret she had no right
to do so.Indeed, as she recalled how sedulously he had guarded it she
was sure he would not thank her for suggesting it to Amy before she was
ready for the knowledge.Impetuous as Miss Hargrove was at times, she had
too fine a nature to be careless of the rights and feelings of others.Moreover, she felt that Webb had been her ally, whether consciously or
not, and he should have his chance with all the help she could give him,
but she was wise enough to know that obtrusion and premature aid are
often disastrous.The decision, after this portentous conference, was: "Mr.Bart must seek
me, and seek very zealously.I know you well enough Amy, to be sure that
you will give him no hints.It's bad enough to love a man before I've
been asked to do so.What an utterly perverse and unmanageable thing
one's heart is!I shall do no angling, however, nor shall I permit any.""You may stand up straight, Gertrude," said Amy, laughing, "but don't
lean over backward."Burt entertained half a dozen wild and half-tragic projects before he
fell asleep late that night, but finally, in utter self-disgust, settled
down on the prosaic and not irrational one of helping through with the
fall work on the farm, and then of seeking some business or profession to
which he could give his whole mind."As to ladies' society," he
concluded, savagely, "I'll shun it hereafter till I'm grown up."Burt always attained a certain kind of peace and the power to sleep after
he had reached an irrevocable decision.During the night the wind veered to the east, and a cold, dismal
rain-storm set in.Dull and dreary indeed the day proved to Burt.He
could not go out and put his resolution into force.He fumed about the
house, restless, yet reticent.He would rather have fought dragons than
keep company with his own thoughts in inaction.All the family supposed
he missed Amy, except Webb, who hoped he missed some one else."Why don't you go over and bring Amy home, Burt?"his mother asked, at
the dinner-table."The house seems empty without her, and everybody is
moping.Even father has fretted over his newspaper, and wished Amy was
here.""Why can't they print an edition of the paper for old men and dark days?""Well," remarked Leonard, leaning back in his chair, and looking
humorously at Maggie, "I'm sorry for you young fellows, but I'm finding
the day serene.""Of course you are," snapped Burt."With an armchair to doze in and a
dinner to look forward to, what more do you wish?As for Webb, he can
always get astride of some scientific hobby, no matter how bad the
weather is.""As for Burt, he can bring Amy home, and then every one will be
satisfied," added his mother, smiling.Thus a new phase of his trial presented itself to poor Burt.He must
either face those two girls after their night's conclave, with all its
possible revelations, or else awaken at once very embarrassing surmises.And in a mood of mingled
recklessness and fear he drove through the storm.When his name was
announced the girls smiled significantly, but went down looking as
unconscious as if they had not spoken of him in six months, and Burt
could not have been more suave, non-committal, and impartially polite if
these ladies had been as remote from his thoughts as one of Webb's
theories.At the same time he intimated that he would be ready to return
when Amy was.At parting the friends gave each other a little look of dismay, and he
caught it from the same telltale mirror that persisted in taking a part
in this drama.though the young fellow, "so they have been exchanging confidences,
and my manner is disconcerting--not what was expected.If I have become a
jest between them it shall be a short-lived one.Miss Hargrove, with all
her city experience, shall find that I'm not so young and verdant but that
I can take a hand in this game also.As for Amy, I now know she never cared
for me, and I don't believe she ever would;" and so he went away with
laughing repartee, and did not see the look of deep disappointment with
which he was followed.Her innocent schemes might not be so
easily accomplished if Burt would be wrong-headed.She was aware of the
dash of recklessness in his character, and feared that under the impulse
of pride he might spoil everything, or, at least, cause much needless
delay.With the fatality of blundering which usually attends upon such
occasions, he did threaten to fulfil her fears, and so successfully that
Amy was in anxiety, and Miss Hargrove grew as pale as she was resolute
not to make the least advance, while poor Webb felt that his suspense
never would end.Burt treated Amy in an easy, fraternal manner.He
engaged actively in the task of gathering and preparing for market the
large crop of apples, and he openly broached the subject of going into a
business of some kind away from home, where, he declared, with a special
meaning for Amy, he was not needed, adding: "It's time I was earning my
salt and settling down to something for life.Webb and Len can take care
of all the land, and I don't believe I was cut out for a farmer."He not only troubled Amy exceedingly, but he perplexed all the family,
for it seemed that he was decidedly taking a new departure.One evening,
a day or two after he had introduced the project of going elsewhere, his
father, to Amy's dismay, suggested that he should go to the far West and
look after a large tract of land which the old gentleman had bought some
years before.It was said that a railroad was to be built through it,
and, if so, the value of the property would be greatly enhanced, and
steps should be taken to get part of it into the market.Burt took hold
of the scheme with eagerness, and was for going as soon as possible.Looking to note the effect of his words upon Amy, he saw that her
expression was not only reproachful, but almost severe.Leonard heartily
approved of the plan.Webb was silent, and in deep despondency, feeling
that if Bart went now nothing would be settled.He saw Amy's aversion to
the project also, and misinterpreted it.She was compelled to admit that the prospects were growing very dark.Burt might soon depart for an indefinite absence, and Miss Hargrove
return to the city.Amy, who had looked upon the mutations in her own
prospects so quietly, was almost feverishly eager to aid her friend.She
feared she had blundered on the mountain ride.Burt's pride had been
wounded, and he had received the impression that his April-like moods had
been discussed satirically.It was certain that he had been very deeply
interested in Gertrude, and that he was throwing away not only his
happiness, but also hers; and Amy felt herself in some degree to blame.Therefore she was bent upon ending the senseless misunderstanding, but
found insurmountable embarrassments on every side.Miss Hargrove was
prouder than Burt.Wild horses could not draw her to the Cliffords', With
a pale, resolute face, she declined even to put herself in the way of
receiving the least advance.Amy would gladly have taken counsel of Webb,
but could not do so without revealing her friend's secret, and also
disclosing mere surmises about Burt, which, although amounting to
conviction in her mind, could not be mentioned.Therefore, from the very
delicacy of the situation, she felt herself helpless.Nature was her
ally, however, and if all that was passing in Burt's mind had been
manifest, the ardent little schemer would not have been so despondent.The best hope of Burt had been that he had checkmated the girls in their
disposition to make jesting comparisons, He would retire with so much
nonchalance as to leave nothing to be said.They would find complete
inaction and silence hard to combat.But the more he thought of it the
less it seemed like an honorable retreat.He had openly wooed one girl,
he had since lost his heart to another, and she had given him a glimpse
of strong regard, if not more.His thoughts were busy with her every word
and glance.How much had his tones and eyes revealed to her?Might she
not think him a heartless flirt if he continued to avoid her and went
away without a word?Would it not be better to be laughed at as one who
did not know his own mind than be despised for deliberate trifling?Amy
had asked him to go and spend an evening with her friend, and he had
pleaded weariness as an excuse.Her incredulous look and rather cool
manner since had not been reassuring.She had that very morning broached
the subject of a chestnutting party for the following day, and he had
promptly said that he was going to the city to make inquiries about
routes to the West."Why, Burt, you can put off your trip to town for a day," said his
mother."If you are to leave us so soon you should make the most of the
days that are left.""That is just what he is doing," Amy remarked, satirically."He has
become absorbed in large business considerations.Those of us who have
not such resources are of no consequence."The old people and Leonard believed that Amy was not pleased with the
idea of Burt's going away, but they felt that she was a little
unreasonable, since the young fellow was rather to be commended for
wishing to take life more seriously.But her words rankled in Burt's
mind.He felt that she understood him better than the others, and that he
was not winning respect from her.In the afternoon he saw her, with Alf
and Johnnie, starting for the chestnut-trees, and although she passed not
far away she gave him only a slight greeting, and did not stop for a
little merry banter, as usual.The young fellow was becoming very
unhappy, and he felt that his position was growing intolerable.That Amy
should be cold toward him, or, indeed, toward any one, was an unheard-of
thing, and he knew that she must feel that there was good reason for her
manner."What are she and
Miss Hargrove thinking about me?"The more he thought upon the past the more awkward and serious appeared
his dilemma, and his long Western journey, which at first he had welcomed
as promising a diversion of excitement and change, now began to appear
like exile.He dreaded to think of the memories he must take with him;
still more he deprecated the thoughts he would leave behind him.His
plight made him so desperate that he suddenly left the orchard where he
was gathering apples, went to the house, put on his riding-suit, and in a
few moments was galloping furiously away on his black horse.With a
renewal of hope Webb watched his proceedings, and with many surmises,
Amy, from a distant hillside, saw him passing at a break-neck pace.CHAPTER LIII

BURT'S RESOLVE


For the first two or three miles Burt rode as if he were trying to leave
care behind him, scarcely heeding what direction he took.When at last he
reined his reeking horse he found himself near the entrance of the lane
over which willows met in a Gothic arch.He yielded to the impulse to visit
the spot which had seen the beginning of so fateful an acquaintance, and
had not gone far when a turn in the road revealed a group whose presence
almost made his heart stand still for a moment.Miss Hargrove had stopped
her horse on the very spot where he had aided her in her awkward
predicament.Her back was toward him, and her great dog was at her side,
looking up into her face, as if in mute sympathy with his fair mistress.She could not be there with bowed head if
she despised him.Her presence seemed in harmony with that glance by
which, when weak and unnerved after escaping from deadly peril, she had
revealed possibly more than gratitude to the one who had rescued her.His
love rose like an irresistible tide, and he resolved that before he left
his home Amy and Miss Hargrove should know the whole truth, whatever
might be the result.Meanwhile he was rapidly approaching the young girl,
and the dog's short bark of recognition was her first intimation of
Hurt's presence.Her impulse was to fly, but in a second she saw the
absurdity of this course, and yet she was greatly embarrassed, and would
rather have been discovered by him at almost any other point of the
globe.She was going to the city on the morrow, and as she had drawn rein
on this spot and realized the bitterness of her disappointment, tears
would come.She wiped them hastily away, but dreaded lest their traces
should be seen.Turning her horse, she met Burt with a smile that her moist eyes belied,
and said: "I'm glad you do not find me in such an awkward plight as when
we first met here.and away like the wind she started homeward.Burt easily kept at her side, but conversation was impossible.At last he
said: "My horse is very tired, Miss Hargrove.At this pace you will soon
be home, and I shall feel that you are seeking to escape from me.Have I
fallen so very low in your estimation?""Why," she exclaimed, in well-feigned surprise, as she checked her horse,
"what have you done that you should fall in my estimation?""I shall tell you before very long," he said, with an expression that
seemed almost tragic.Surely
this brief gallop cannot have so tried your superb beast."Oh, no," he replied, with a grim laugh.I had been riding rapidly before I met you.My horse has been
idle for some days, and I had to run the spirit out of him.Amy wishes to
have a chestnutting party to-morrow.Clifford, but I return to the city tomorrow afternoon,
and was coming over in the morning to say good-by to Amy and your father
and mother.""I am very sorry too," he said, in tones that gave emphasis to his words.She turned upon him a swift, questioning glance, but her eyes instantly
fell before his intense gaze."Oh, well," she said, lightly, "we've had a very pleasant summer, and all
things must come to an end, you know."Then she went on speaking, in a
matter-of-fact way, of the need of looking after Fred, who was alone in
town, and of getting the city house in order, and of her plans for the
winter, adding: "As there is a great deal of fruit on the place, papa
does not feel that he can leave just yet.You know he goes back and forth
often, and so his business does not suffer.But I can just as well go
down now, and nearly all my friends have returned to town.""All your friends, Miss Hargrove?""Amy has promised to visit me soon," she said, hastily."It would seem that I am not down on your list of friends," he began,
gloomily.Clifford, I'm sure papa and I would be glad to have you call
whenever you are in town.""I fear I shall have to disappoint Mr.Hargrove," he said, a little
satirically."I'm going West the last of this month, and may be absent
much of the winter.I expect to look about in that section for some
opening in business.""Indeed," she replied, in tones which were meant to convey but little
interest, yet which had a slight tremor in spite of her efforts."It will
be a very great change for you.""Perhaps you think that constitutes its chief charm."Clifford," she said, "what chance have I had to think about it at
all?(Amy had, however, and
Gertrude had not only thought about it, but dreamed of it, as if she had
been informed that on a certain date the world would end.)"Is it not a
rather sudden plan?"My father has a large tract of land in the West, and it's
time it was looked after.Isn't it natural that I should think of doing
something in life?I fear there is an impression in your mind that I
entertain few thoughts beyond having a good time.""To have a good time in life," she said, smiling at him, "is a very
serious matter, worthy of any one's attention.It would seem that few
accomplish it.""And I greatly fear that I shall share in the ill-success of the
majority."You will soon be
enjoying the excitement of travel and enterprise in the West.""And you the excitement of society and conquest in the city.Conquests,
however, must be almost wearisome to you, Miss Hargrove, you make them so
easily."I certainly should soon weary of conquests were I
making them.Where in
history do we read of a man who was satiated with conquest?"Are you going to the city to-morrow?""Will you forgive me if I come alone?"I suppose Amy will be tired from nutting."He did not reply, but lifted his hat gravely, mounted his horse, and
galloped away as if he were an aid bearing a message that might avert a
battle.Miss Hargrove hastened to her room, and took off her hat with trembling
hands.Burt's pale, resolute face told her that the crisis in her life
had come.If he meant to speak,
why had he not done so?why had he not asked permission to consult her
father?Hargrove, from his library window, saw Burt's formal parting, and
concluded that his fears or hopes--he scarcely knew which were uppermost,
so deep was his love for his daughter, and so painful would it be to see
her unhappy--were not to be fulfilled.By a great effort Gertrude
appeared not very _distraite_ at dinner, nor did she mention Burt,
except in a casual manner, in reply to a question from her mother, but
her father thought he detected a strong and suppressed excitement.She excused herself early from the table, and said she must finish
packing for her departure.CHAPTER LIV

A GENTLE EXORCIST


Burt's black horse was again white before he approached his home.In the
distance he saw Amy returning, the children running on before, Alf
whooping like a small Indian to some playmate who was answering further
away.The gorgeous sunset lighted up the still more brilliant foliage,
and made the scene a fairyland.But Burt had then no more eye for nature
than a man would have who had staked his all on the next throw of the
dice.Amy was alone, and now was his chance to intercept her before she
reached the house.Imagine her surprise as she saw him make his horse
leap the intervening fences, and come galloping toward her."Burt," she cried, as he, in a moment or two, reined up near her, "you
will break your neck!""It wouldn't matter much," he said, grimly."I fear a worse fate than
that."He threw the bridle over a stake in the fence, and the horse was glad to
rest, with drooping head.Then he came and stood beside her, his face
flushed, and his mouth twitching with excitement and strong feeling."Burt," she said, "what is the matter?"I fear your scorn, Amy," he began, impetuously; "I fear I shall lose
your respect forever.But I can't go on any longer detesting myself and
feeling that you and Miss Hargrove despise me.I may seem to you and her
a fickle fool, a man of straw, but you shall both know the truth.I
shan't go away a coward.I can at least be honest, and then you may think
what you please of my weakness and vacillation.You cannot think worse
things than I think myself, but you must not imagine that I am a
cold-blooded, deliberate trifler, for that has never been true.I know
you don't care for me, and never did.""Indeed, Burt, you are mistaken.I do care for you immensely," said Amy,
eagerly clasping his arm with both her hands."Amy, Amy," said Burt, in a low, desperate tone, "think how few short
months have passed since I told you I loved you, and protested I would
wait till I was gray.You have seen me giving my thoughts to another, and
in your mind you expect to see me carried away by a half-dozen more.You
are mistaken, but it will take a long time to prove it.""No, Burt, I understand you better than you think.Gertrude has inspired
in you a very different feeling from the one you had for me.I think you
are loving now with a man's love, and won't get over it very soon, if you
ever do.You have seen, you must have felt, that my love for you was only
that of a sister, and of course you soon began to feel toward me in the
same way.I don't believe I would have married you had you waited an age.Don't fret, I'm not going to break my heart about you.""I should think not, nor will any one else.Oh, Amy, I so despised myself
that I have been half-desperate.""Despised yourself because you love a girl like Gertrude Hargrove!I
never knew a man to do a more natural and sensible thing, whether she
gave you encouragement or not.If I were a man I would make love to her,
rest assured, and she would have to refuse me more than once to be rid of
me."Burt took a long breath of immense relief."You are heavenly kind," he
said."Are you sure you won't despise me?It seems
to me that I have done such an awfully mean thing in making love to you
in my own home, and then in changing.""Fate has been too strong for you, and I
think--I mean--I hope, it has been kind.Bless you, Burt, I could never
get up any such feeling as sways you.I should always be disappointing,
and you would have found out, sooner or later, that your best chance
would be to discover some one more responsive.Since you have been so
frank, I'll be so too.I was scarcely more ready for your words last
spring than Johnnie, but I was simple enough to think that in half a
dozen years or so we might be married if all thought it was best, and my
pride was a little hurt when I saw what--what--well, Gertrude's influence
over you.But I've grown much older the last few months, and know now
that my thoughts were those of a child.My feeling for you is simply that
of a sister, and I don't believe it would ever have changed.I
might eventually have an acute attack also, and then I should be in a
worse predicament than yours.""But you will be my loving sister as long as you live, Amy?You will
believe that I have a little manhood if given a chance to show it?""I believe it now, Burt, and I can make you a hundredfold better sister
than wife.It seems but the other day I was playing with dolls.You have judged yourself too harshly;" and she
looked at him so smilingly and affectionately that he took her in his
arms and kissed her again and again, exclaiming, "You can count on one
brother to the last drop of his blood.Oh, Amy, whatever happens now, I
won't lose courage.Miss Hargrove will have to say no a dozen times
before she is through with me."At this moment Webb, from the top of a tall ladder in the orchard,
happened to glance that way, and saw the embrace.He instantly descended,
threw down his basket of apples, and with it all hope.The coolness between them had been but a misunderstanding, which
apparently had been banished most decidedly.He mechanically took down
his ladder and placed it on the ground, then went to his room to prepare
for supper."Burt," cried Amy, when they were half-way home, "you have forgotten your
horse.""If he were Pegasus, I should have forgotten him to-day."Oh, yes, I'll do anything for you.""Will you tell me if you think Miss
Hargrove--"

"No, I won't tell you anything.After she has refused you half
a dozen times, I may, out of pity, intercede a little.Go get your horse,
smooth your brow, and be sensible, or you'll have Webb and Leonard poking
fun at you.Suppose they have seen you galloping over fences and ditches
like one possessed.""Well, I was possessed, and never was there such a kind, gentle exorcist.I have seen Miss Hargrove to-day; I had just parted from her."How could I, until I had told you?I felt I was bound to you by
all that can bind a man.""Oh, Burt, suppose I had not released you, but played Shylock, what would
you have done?"and her laugh rang out again in intense merriment."I had no fears of that," he replied, ruefully."You are the last one to
practice Mrs.My fear was that you and Miss
Hargrove both would send me West as a precious good riddance.""Well, it was square of you, as Alf says, to come to me first, and I
appreciate it, but I should not have resented the omission.Will you
forgive my curiosity if I ask what is the next move in the campaign?I've
been reading about the war, you know, and I am quite military in my
ideas.""I have Miss Hargrove's permission to call to-night.It wasn't given very
cordially, and she asked me to bring you.""Oh, I told her she would have to forgive me if I came alone.I meant to
have it out to-day, if old Chaos came again."When Amy's renewed laughter
so subsided that he could speak, he resumed: "I'm going over there after
supper, to ask her father for permission to pay my addresses, and if he
won't give it, I shall tell him I will pay them all the same--that I
shall use every effort in my power to win his daughter.I don't want a
dollar of his money, but I'm bound to have the girl if she'll ever listen
to me after knowing all you know."Amy's laugh ceased, and she again clasped her hands on his arm."Dear
Burt," she said, "your course now seems to me manly and straightforward.I saw the strait you were in, but did not think you felt it so keenly.In
going West I feared you were about to run away from it.However Gertrude
may treat you, you have won my respect by your downright truth.She may
do as she pleases, but she can't despise you now.He has learned this afternoon that you are in no state of
mind to take care of him."CHAPTER LV

BURT TELLS HIS LOVE AGAIN


Webb appeared at the supper-table the personification of quiet geniality,
but Amy thought she had never seen him look so hollow-eyed.The long
strain was beginning to tell on him, decidedly, and to-night he felt as
if he had received a mortal blow.But with indomitable courage he hid his
wound, and seemed absorbed in a conversation with Leonard and his father
about the different varieties of apples, and their relative value.Amy
saw that his mother was looking at him anxiously, and she did not wonder.He was growing thin even to gauntness.Burt also was an arrant dissembler, and on rising from the table remarked
casually that he was going over to bid Miss Hargrove good-by, as she
would return to town on the morrow."She'll surely come and see us before she goes," Mrs."It seems to me she hasn't been very sociable of late."She told me she
was coming to say good-by to us all, and she has asked me to visit her.Come, Webb, you look all tired out to-night.I'll
stumble through the dryest scientific treatise you have if I can see you
resting on the sofa.""That's ever so kind of you, Amy, and I appreciate it more than you
imagine, but I'm going out this evening.""Oh, of course, sisters are of no account.What girl are _you_ going
to see?"I am too old and dull to entertain the pretty
creatures."You know one you could entertain if she isn't a pretty
creature, but then she's only a sister who doesn't know much.""I'm sorry--I must go," he said, a little abruptly, for her lovely,
half-laughing, half-reproachful face, turned to his, contained such
mocking promise of happiness that he could not look upon it.His rapid steps as he walked mile after mile indicated
that the matter was pressing indeed; but, although it was late before he
returned, he had spoken to no one.The house was dark and silent except
that a light was burning in Burt's room.And his momentous fortunes the
reader must now follow.Miss Hargrove, with a fluttering heart, heard the rapid feet of his horse
as he rode up the avenue.Truly, he was coming at a lover's pace.The
door-bell rang, she heard him admitted, and expected the maid's tap at
her door to follow.Were the tumultuous throbs of
her heart so loud that she could not hear it?She opened her door slightly; there was no
sound.There below, like a shadow, stood a
saddled horse.Had the stupid girl shown him into
the drawing-room and left him there?Surely the well-trained servant had
never been guilty of such a blunder before.Could it have been some one
else who had come to see her father on business?She stole down the
stairway in a tremor of apprehension, and strolled into the parlor in the
most nonchalant manner imaginable.It was lighted, but empty, and her
expression suddenly became one of troubled perplexity.She returned to
the hall, and started as if she had seen an apparition.There on the rack
hung Burt's hat, as natural as life.Voices reached her ear from her
father's study.She took a few swift steps toward it, then fled to her
room, and stood panting before her mirror, which reflected a young lady
in a costume charmingly ill adapted to "packing.""It was honorable in
him to speak to papa first, and papa would not, could not, answer him
without consulting me.I cannot be treated as a child any longer," she
muttered, with flashing eyes."Papa loves me," she murmured, in swift
alternation of gentle feeling."He could not make my happiness secondary
to a paltry sum of money."Hargrove had greeted him with
no little surprise.The parting of the young people had not promised any
such interview."Have you spoken to my daughter on this subject?"Hargrove asked,
gravely, after the young fellow had rather incoherently made known his
errand."No, sir," replied Burt, "I have not secured your permission.At the same
time," he added, with an ominous flash in his blue eyes, "sincerity
compels me to say that I could not take a final refusal from any lips
except those of your daughter, and not readily from hers.I would not
give up effort to win her until convinced that any amount of patient
endeavor was useless.I should not persecute her, but I would ask her to
reconsider an adverse answer as often as she would permit, and I will try
with all my soul to render myself more worthy of her."Hargrove, severely, "if I should decline this
honor, I should count for nothing.""No, sir, I do not mean that, and I hope I haven't said it, even by
implication.Your consent that I should have a fair field in which to do
my best would receive from me boundless gratitude.What I mean to say is,
that I could not give her up; I should not think it right to do so.This
question is vital to me, and I know of no reason," he added, a little
haughtily, "why I should be refused a privilege which is considered the
right of every gentleman.""I have not in the slightest degree raised the question of your being a
gentleman, Mr.Your course in coming to me before revealing
your regard to my daughter proves that you are one.But you should
realize that you are asking a great deal of me.My child's happiness is
my first and only consideration.You know the condition of life to which
my daughter has been accustomed.It is right and natural that I should
also know something of your prospects, your ability to meet the
obligations into which you wish to enter."After a moment he answered,
with a dignity and an evident sincerity which won golden opinions from
Mr.Hargrove: "I shall not try to mislead you in the least on this point.For my own sake I wish that your daughter were far poorer than I am.I
can say little more than that I could give her a home now and every
comfort of life.I could not now provide for her the luxury to which she
has been accustomed.But I am willing to wait and eager to work.In youth
and health and a fair degree of education I have some capital in addition
to the start in life which my father has promised to his sons.What could
not Miss Hargrove inspire a man to do?"The man of experience smiled in spite of himself at Burt's frank
enthusiasm and naivete.The whole affair was so different from anything
that he had ever looked forward to!Instead of a few formalities between
himself and a wealthy suitor whom his wife, and therefore all the world,
would approve of, here he was listening to a farmer's son, with the
consciousness that he must yield, and not wholly unwilling to do so.Moreover, this preposterous young man, so far from showing any awe of
him, had almost defied him from the start, and had plainly stated that
the father's wealth was the only objection to the daughter.Having seen
the drift of events, Mr.Hargrove had long since informed himself
thoroughly about the Clifford family, and had been made to feel that the
one fact of his wealth, which Burt regretted, was almost his only claim
to superiority.Burt was as transparent as a mountain brook, and quite as
impetuous.The gray-haired man sighed, and felt that he would give all
his wealth in exchange for such youth.He knew his daughter's heart, and
felt that further parleying was vain, although he foresaw no easy task in
reconciling his wife to the match.He was far from being heartbroken
himself, however, for there was such a touch of nature in Burt, and in
the full, strong love waiting to reward the youth, that his own heart was
stirred, and in the depths of his soul he knew that this was better than
giving his child to a jaded millionaire."I have money enough for both,"
he thought."As she said, she is rich enough to follow her heart.It's a
pity if we can't afford an old-fashioned love-match."Hargrove's deep thought and
silence.At last the father arose and gave him his hand, saying: "You have been
honest with me, and that, with an old merchant, counts for a great deal.I also perceive you love my daughter for herself.If she should ever
inform me that you are essential to her happiness I shall not withhold my
consent."Burt seized his hand with a grasp that made it ache, as he said, "Every
power I have, sir, shall be exerted that you may never regret this
kindness.""If you make good that promise, Mr.Clifford, I shall become your friend
should your wooing prove successful.If you will come to the parlor I
will tell Miss Hargrove that you are here."He went up the stairs slowly, feeling that he was crossing the threshold
of a great change.How many thoughts passed through his mind as he took
those few steps!He saw his child a little black-eyed baby in his arms;
she was running before him trundling her hoop; she came to him with
contracted brow and half-tearful eyes, bringing a knotty sum in
fractions, and insisting petulantly that they were very "vulgar" indeed;
she hung on his arm, a shy girl of fifteen, blushingly conscious of the
admiring eyes that followed her; she stood before him again in her first
radiant beauty as a _debutante_, and he had dreamed of the proudest
alliance that the city could offer; she looked into his eyes, a pale,
earnest woman, and said, "Papa, he saved my life at the risk of his own."Clifford had not spoken of that, and Mr.Hargrove had not
thought of it in the interview so crowded with considerations.His heart
relented toward the youth as it had not done before.Well, well, since it
was inevitable, he was glad to be the one who should first bring the
tidings of this bold wooer's purpose."Trurie will never forget this
moment," he mattered, as he knocked at her door, "nor my part in her
little drama."O love, how it craves even the crumbs that fall from the
table of its idol!"Trurie," he began, as he entered, "you had better dress.Bless me, I
thought you were packing!"Clifford said he would call--to bid me good-by, I suppose.""Was that all you supposed, Trurie?""Indeed, papa, I told him I was going to town to-morrow, and he asked if
he might call."I'm sure it's quite natural he should call, and I have been
packing.""Well, I can assure you that he has a very definite object.He has asked
me if he might pay his addresses to you, and in the same breath assured
me that he would in any event.""Oh, papa," she said, hiding her face on his shoulder, "he was not so
unmannerly as that!""Indeed, he went much further, declaring that he would take no refusal
from you, either; or, rather, that he would take it so often as to wear
out your patience, and secure you by proving that resistance was useless.He had one decided fault to find with you, also."Oh, papa, tell me what he did say;" and he felt her heart fluttering
against his side like that of a frightened bird."Why, Trurie, men have offered you love before.""But I never loved before, nor knew what it meant," she whispered.This is all so strange, so sacred to
me.""Well, Trurie, I hope your match may be one of those that are made in
heaven.Your mother will think it anything but worldly wise.However, I
will reconcile her to it, and I'm glad to be the one with whom you will
associate this day.Long after I am gone it may remind you how dear your
happiness was to me, and that I was willing to give up my way for yours.Clifford has been straightforward and manly, if not conventional, and
I've told him that if he could win you and would keep his promise to do
his best for you and by you, I would be his friend, and that, you know,
means much.Of course, it all depends upon whether you accept him.Here is an organ"--with her hand upon her heart--"that
knows better."Oh, no, I can excuse you," he said, with smiling lips but moist eyes."Dear papa, I will, indeed, associate you with this hour and every
pleasant thing in life.You will find that you have won me anew instead
of losing me;" and looking back at him with her old filial love shining
in her eyes, she went slowly away to meet the future under the sweet
constraint of Nature's highest law.If Burt had been impatient in the library, he grew almost desperate in
the parlor.Might not Miss
Hargrove's pride rise in arms against him?Might she not even now be
telling her father of his fickleness, and declaring that she would not
listen to a "twice-told tale"?Every moment of delay seemed ominous, and
many moments passed.The house grew sepulchral in its silence, and the
wind without sighed and moaned as if Nature foreboded and pitied him in
view of the overwhelming misfortune impending.At last he sprang up and
paced the room in his deep perturbation.As he turned toward the entrance
he saw framed in the doorway a picture that appeared like a radiant
vision.Miss Hargrove stood there, looking at him so intently that, for a
second or two, he stood spell-bound.She was dressed in some white,
clinging material, and, with her brilliant eyes, appeared in the
uncertain light too beautiful and wraith-like to be human.She saw her
advantage, and took the initiative instantly.Clifford," she
exclaimed, "do I seem an apparition?""Yes, you do," he replied, coming impetuously toward her.She held out
her hand, proposing that their interview should at least begin at arm's
length.Nevertheless, the soft fire in his eyes and the flush on his
handsome face made her tremble with a delicious apprehension.Even while
at a loss to know just how to manage the preliminaries for a decorous
yielding, she exulted over the flame-like spirit of her lover.Clifford," she cried, "you ought to know that you are not
crushing a ghost's hand."What I meant was that I thought I had seen you before, but
you are a new revelation every time I see you.""Please don't say that, for I must ask you to interpret one to-night.What does Shakespeare say about those who have power?I hope you will use
yours mercifully.Oh, Miss Hargrove, you are so beautiful that I believe
I should lose my reason if you sent me away without hope."Clifford, you are talking wildly," was her faint response.I am almost desperate from fear, for I have a terribly hard
duty to perform."she said, withdrawing her hand, which he relinquished most
reluctantly, dreading that he might never receive it again."Do not assume that attitude, Miss Hargrove, or I shall lose courage
utterly."Clifford," she said, a little satirically, seating herself on
a sofa, "I never imagined you deficient in courage.Is it a terrible duty
to entertain me for a half-hour, and say good-by?"Nothing could be worse than that, if that were all;" and he looked
at her appealingly and in such perplexed distress that she laughed
outright."I am very much in earnest, Miss Hargrove.""You are very enigmatical, Mr.Must I be present while you
perform this terrible duty?""I think you know what I must confess already, and have a world of scorn
in store for me.Whatever the end may be, and my
sense of ill-desert is heavy indeed, I shall begin on the basis of
absolute truth.I've asked your father for the
privilege of winning your love;" and then he hesitated, not knowing how
to go on."No, I fear it will be the best, for he kindly gave his consent, and I
know it would be hard for him to do as much for any man, much more so for
one not wholly to his mind.Miss Hargrove, I must appear awkwardness and
incoherency personified.I shall appear to
you fickle and unmanly.How can I excuse myself to you when I have no
excuse except the downright truth that I love you better than my life,
better than my own soul, better than all the world and everything in it.I never knew what love was until you became unconscious in my arms on the
mountain.I'm only trying to explain
myself; and yet I had thought that I knew, and had spoken words of love
to your friend, Amy Winfield, who is worthy of the love of the best and
noblest man that ever breathed.She did not welcome my words--they only
wounded her--and she has never eared for me except as a true and gentle
sister cares.But I promised to wait till she did care.You fascinated me from the first hour of our meeting.I feel now
that I cherished an unworthy purpose toward you.I thought that, by
attentions to you, I could make Amy care; I thought that you were but a
brilliant society girl; but every hour I spent with you increased my
admiration, my respect; I saw that you were better and stronger than I
was.On the first day we went into camp on the mountain I saw whither my
heart was leading me, and from that hour until to-day I have tried to
conquer my love, feeling that I had no right to give it, that you would
despise it if I did.You can't have any confidence in me now.All my hope
is that you will give me a chance to prove that I am not a fickle wretch.I will accept of any probation, I will submit to any terms.I can't take
an absolute refusal now, for I feel you are seeing me at my worst, and I
know that you could do with me anything you pleased."Her head bowed lower and lower as he poured out these words like a
torrent."Does Amy--have you told her that you cannot keep your promise
to her?""Oh, yes, I told her so a few hours ago--since I met you this afternoon.I was going away to the West, like a coward, to escape from my dilemma,
for I felt you would never listen to me after you knew that I had broken
my word to Amy.I feared that I had already become a by-word between you
for all that was weak and fickle.But after I saw you I could not go till
I spoke.I determined to reveal the whole truth, and if you ever gave me
a chance to retrieve myself, gratitude would be no name for my deep
feeling.She told me in good plain English that she
wanted neither me nor my promise; that she didn't think that she ever
could have loved me, no matter how long I might have waited.But I could
not look into your clear eyes and say, 'I love you,' and know that you
might learn from her or any one that I had said this before.If you won't
trust me, having had the whole truth, then I must bear my hard fate as
best I can.""How long would you be willing to wait for me?"she asked, in tones so
low that he could scarcely catch the words.He bounded to her side, and took her unresisting hand."Oh, Gertrude," he
pleaded, "prove me, give me a chance, let me show that I am not without
manhood and constancy.Believe me, I know the priceless gift I'm asking,
but what else can I do?I have tried for weeks to conquer the feeling you
have inspired, tried with all the help that pride and sense of duty and
honor could give, but it has been utterly useless.I now am free; I have
the right to speak.At last she raised her downcast eyes and averted face to his, and for a
moment he was dazed at their expression.In tones sweet, low, and deep
with her strong emotion, she said, "Burt, how glad I am that you men are
blind!I found out that I loved you before we went to our mountain camp."She sprang up and gave him her other hand as she continued: "Can love
impose such hard conditions as you suggest--months of doubtful waiting
for one who risked his life for me without a second's hesitation?That is
not my nature, Burt.If I have power over you, I shall show it in another
way."She would never forget his look as he listened to these words, nor his
humility as he lowered his head upon her shoulder, and murmured, "I am
not worthy of this."It touched the deepest and tenderest chord in her
heart.His feeling was not the exultation of success, but a gratitude too
deep for words, and a half-conscious appeal that she would use her
woman's power to evoke a better manhood.It was not mere acknowledgment
of her beauty, or the impulse of his passion; it was homage to the best
and noblest part of her nature, the expression of his absolute trust.Never had she received such a tribute, and she valued it more than if
Burt had laid untold wealth at her feet.A great joy is often as sobering as a great sorrow, and they talked long
and earnestly together.Gertrude would not become engaged until she had
told her mother, and shown her the respect that was her due."You must
not be resentful," the young girl said, "if mamma's consent is not easily
won.She has set her heart on an establishment in town, I've set my heart
on you; so there we differ, and you must give me time to reconcile her to
a different programme."The clock on the mantel chimed eleven, and Burt started up, aghast at the
flight of time.Gertrude stole to her father's library, and found that he
was pacing the floor."I should not have left him alone so long
to-night," she thought, with compunction."Papa," she said, "Mr.He looked into his daughter's flushed, happy face, and needed no further
explanation, and with her hands on his arm he went to the drawing-room.Burt said but few and very simple words, and the keen judge of men liked
him beter than if he had been more exuberant.There was evidence of
downright earnestness now that seemed a revelation of a new trait."You spoke of going to the West soon," Mr.Hargrove remarked, as they
lingered in parting."Have you any objection to telling me of your
purpose?"Hargrove's face soon expressed unusual interest."I
must talk with you further about this," he said."I have land in the same
locality, and also an interest in the railroad to which you refer.Perhaps I can make your journey of mutual service.""Oh, papa," cried his daughter, "you are my good genius!"for she well
understood what that mutual service meant.Hargrove said, "Well, well, this Western-land
business puts a new aspect on the affair, and mamma may have little
ground for complaint.It's my impression that the Cliffords will realize
a very respectable fortune out of that land.""Papa," said the young girl, "Burt gave me something better than wealth
to-night--better even than love, in the usual sense of the word.He acted as if he saw in me the power to help him to be a
true man, and what higher compliment can a woman receive?He did not
express it so much by word as by an unconscious manner, that was so
sincere and unpremeditated that it thrilled my very soul.Oh, papa, you
have helped me to be so very happy!"CHAPTER LVI

WEBB'S FOUR-LEAVED CLOVER


Webb's silent entrance had not been so quiet but that Burt heard him.Scarcely had he gained his room before the younger brother knocked, and
followed him in without waiting."Where have you been at this time of
night?""You are infringing on ghostly hours, and are
beginning to look like a ghost;" for Webb had thrown himself into a
chair, and was haggard from the exhaustion of his long conflict.The
light and kindly way in which he answered his brother proved that he was
victor."Webb," said Burt, putting his hand on the elder brother's shoulder, "you
saved my life last winter, and life has become of immense value to me.If
you had not found me, I should have missed a happiness that falls to the
lot of few--a happiness of which all your science can never give you, you
old delver, even an idea.I meant to tell mother and father first, but I
feel to-night how much I owe to your brave, patient search, and I want
your congratulations.""I think you might have told father and mother last night, for I suppose
it's morning now.""I did not get home in time, and did not wish to excite mother, and spoil
her rest.""Well, then, you might have come earlier or gone later.I think not, if you know all about what I didn't know, and
could scarcely believe possible myself, till an hour or two since."I think you might have stayed at home
with Amy to-night, of all times.An accident, Burt, revealed to me your
success, and I do congratulate you most sincerely.You have now the
truest and loveliest girl in the world.""That's true, but what possible accident could have revealed the fact to
you?""Don't think I was spying upon you.From the top of a ladder in the
orchard I saw, as the result of a casual glance, your reward to Amy for
words that must have been very satisfactory."Burt began to laugh as if he could not control himself."What a surprise
I have for you all!""I went where I did last night with Amy's
full knowledge and consent.She never cared a rap for me, but the only
other girl in the world who is her equal does, and her name is Gertrude
Hargrove."Webb gave a great start, and sank into a chair."Don't be so taken aback, old fellow.I suppose you and the rest had set
your hearts on my marrying Amy.You have only to follow Amy's example,
and give me your blessing.Yes, you saw me give Amy a very grateful and
affectionate greeting last evening.She's the dearest little sister that
ever a man had, and that's all she ever wanted to be to me.I felt
infernally mean when I came to her yesterday, for I was in an awkward
strait.I had promised to wait for her till she did care, but she told me
that there was no use in waiting, and I don't believe there would have
been.She would have seen some one in the future who would awaken a very
different feeling from any that I could inspire, and then, if she had
promised herself to me, she would have been in the same predicament that
I was.She is the best and most sensible little girl that ever breathed,
and feels toward me just as she does toward you, only she very justly
thinks you have forgotten more than lever knew.As for Gertrude--Hang it
all!You'll say I'm at my old
tricks, but I'm not.You've seen how circumstances have brought us
together, and I tell you my eye and heart are filled now for all time.She will be over to-morrow, and I want her to receive the greeting she
deserves."The affair seemed of such tremendous importance to Burt that he was not
in the least surprised that Webb was deeply moved, and fortunately he
talked long enough to give his brother time to regain his self-control.Webb did congratulate him in a way that was entirely satisfactory, and
then bundled him out of the room in the most summary manner, saying,
"Because you are a hare-brained lover, you shouldn't keep sane people
awake any longer."It were hard to say, however, who was the less sane
that night, Webb or Burt.The former threw open his window, and gazed at
the moonlit mountains in long, deep ecstasy.Unlike Burt's, his more
intense feeling would find quiet expression.All he knew was that there
was a chance for him--that he had the right to put forth the best effort
of which he was capable--and he thanked God for that.At the same time he
remembered Amy's parable of the rose.He would woo as warily as
earnestly.With Burt's experience before his eyes, he would never stun
her with sudden and violent declarations.His love, like sunshine, would
seek to develop the flower of her love.He was up and out in the October dawn, too happy and excited for sleep.His weariness was gone; his sinews seemed braced with steel as he strode
to a lofty eminence.No hue on the richly tinted leaves nor on the rival
chrysanthemums was brighter than his hope, and the cool, pure air, in
which there was as yet no frostiness, was like exhilarating wine.From
the height he looked down on his home, the loved casket of the more
dearly prized jewel.He viewed the broad acres on which he had toiled,
remembering with a dull wonder that once he had been satisfied with their
material products.Now there was a glamour upon them, and upon all the
landscape.The river gleamed and sparkled; the mountains flamed like the
plumage of some tropical bird.The earth and
his old materiality became the foundation-stones on which his awakened
mind, kindled and made poetic, should rear an airy, yet enduring,
structure of beauty, consecrated to Amy.He had loved nature before, but
it had been to him like a palace in which, as a dull serving-man, he had
employed himself in caring for its furniture and the frames of its
paintings.But he had been touched by a magic wand, and within the frames
glowed ever-changing pictures, and the furniture was seen to be the work
of divine art.The palace was no longer empty, but enshrined a living
presence, a lovely embodiment of Nature's purest and best manifestation.The development of no flower in all the past summer was so clear to him
as that of the girl he loved.He felt as if he had known her thoughts
from childhood.Her young womanhood was like that of the roses he had
shown to her in the dewy June dawn that seemed so long ago.It was still like a bud of his favorite
mossrose, wrapped in its green calyx.Oh, what a wealth of fragrant
beauty would be revealed!But she should
waken in her own time; and if he had not the power to impart the deep,
subtile impulse, then that nearest to her, Nature, should be his bride.They were all at the breakfast-table when he returned, and this plotter
against Amy's peace entered and greeted her with a very quiet
"Good-morning," but he laid beside her plate a four-leaved clover which
he had espied on his way back."Thanks, Webb," she said, with eyes full of merriment; "I foresee an
amazing amount of good luck in this little emblem.Indeed, I feel sure
that startling proofs of it will occur to-day;" and she looked
significantly at Burt, who laughed very consciously."What mischief has Burt been up to, Amy?""He was
ready to explode with suppressed something last evening at supper, and
now he is effervescing in somewhat different style, but quite as
remarkably.You boys needn't think you can hide anything from mother very
long; she knows you too well."Both Webb and Burt, with Amy, began to laugh, and they looked at each
other as if there were a good deal that mother did not know."Webb and Amy have evidently some joke on Burt," remarked Leonard."Webb
was out last night, and I bet a pippin he caught Burt flirting with Miss
Hargrove.""Burt is going to settle down now and be
steady.We'll make him sign a pledge before he goes West, won't we, Amy?""Yes, indeed," gasped Amy, almost beside herself with merriment; "he'll
have to sign one in big capitals.""Burt," said his father, looking at him over his spectacles, "you've been
getting yourself into some scrape as sure as the world.That's right,
Amy; you laugh at him well, and--"

"A truce!""If I'm in a scrape, I don't propose to get
out of it, but rather to make you all share in it.As Amy says, her
four-leaved clover will prove a true prophet, green as it looks.I now
beg off, and shall prove that my scrape has not spoiled my appetite.""Well," said Leonard, "I never could find any four-leaved clovers, but
I've had good luck, haven't I, Maggie?""You had indeed, when you came courting me.""I am satisfied," began Webb, "that I could develop acres of four-leaved
clover.I have counted twenty-odd on
one root.If seed from such a plant were sown, and then seed selected
again from the new plants most characterized by this'sport,' I believe
the trait would become fixed, and we could have a field of four-leaved
clover.New varieties of fruits, vegetables, and flowers are often thus
developed from chance'sports' or abnormal specimens.""He would turn this ancient symbol of fortune
into a marketable commodity.""Pardon me; I was saying what might be done, not what I proposed to do.I
found this emblem of good chance by chance, and I picked it with the
'wish' attacked to the stem.Thus to the utmost I have honored the
superstition, and you have only to make your wish to carry it out fully.""My wishes are in vain, and all the four-leaved clovers in the world
wouldn't help them.I wish I was a scientific problem, a crop that
required great skill to develop, a rare rose that all the rose-maniacs
were after, a new theory that required a great deal of consideration and
investigation, and accompanied with experiments that needed much
observation, and any number of other t-i-o-n-shuns.Then I shouldn't be
left alone evenings by the great inquiring mind of the family.Burt's
going away, and, as his father says, has got into a scrape; so what's to
become of me?"They all arose from the table amid general laughter, of which Webb and
Burt were equally the objects, and on the faces of those not in the
secret there was much perplexed curiosity.exclaimed Maggie, "if Webb should concentrate his mind
on you as you suggest, it would end by his falling in love with you."This speech was received with shouts of merriment, and Amy felt the color
rushing into her face, but she scouted the possibility."The idea of
Webb's falling in love with any one!""I should as soon expect
to see old Storm King toppling over.""Still waters run--" began Maggie, but a sudden flash from Webb's eyes
checked her."Some still waters don't run at all.Not
for the world would I have Webb incur the dreadful risk that you suggest.""I think I'm almost old enough to take care of myself, sister Amy, and I
promise you to try to be as entertaining as such an old fellow can be.As
to falling in love with you, that happened long ago--the first evening
you came, when you stood in the doorway blushing and frightened at the
crowd of your new relations.""Haven't I got over being afraid of them remarkably?I never was a bit
afraid of you even at first.It took me a long time, however, to find out
how learned you were, and what deep subjects are required to interest
you.Alas, I shall never be a deep subject."Clifford, putting his arm around her, "you have
come like sunshine into the old home, and we old people can't help
wishing you may never go out of it while we are alive.""I'm not a bit jealous, Amy," said Maggie."I think it's time this mutual admiration society broke up," the young
girl said, with tears trembling in her eyes."When I think of it all, and
what a home I've found, I'm just silly enough to cry.I think it's time,
Burt, that you obtained your father's and mother's forgiveness or
blessing, or whatever it is to be.""You are right, Amy, as you always are.and
if you will accompany us, sir (to his father), you shall learn the
meaning of Amy's four-leaved clover.""You needn't think you are going to get Amy without my consent," Leonard
called after him."I've known her longer than any of you--ever since she
was a little girl at the depot."Amy and Webb began laughing so heartily at the speaker that he went away
remarking that he could pick apples if he couldn't solve riddles."Come up to my room, Amy," said Maggie, excitedly."No, no, Mother Eve, I shall go to my own room, and dress for company.""Burt said something more than
good-by to Miss Hargrove last evening."Amy would not answer, and the sound of a mirthful snatch of song died
musically away in the distance.Webb," Maggie resumed, "what did _you_ mean by that ominous
flash from your cavern-like eyes?""It meant that Amy has probably been satisfied with one lover in the
family and its unexpected result.I don't wish our relations embarrassed
by the feeling that she must be on her guard against another.""Oh, I see, you don't wish her to be on her guard.""Dear Maggie, whatever you may see, appear blind.Heaven only knows what
you women don't see."I've suspected you for
some time, but thought Burt and Amy were committed to each other.""Amy does not suspect anything, and she must not.She is not ready for
the knowledge, and may never be.All the help I ask is to keep her
unconscious.I've been expecting you would find me out, for you married
ladies have had an experience which doubles your insight, and I'm glad of
the chance to caution you.Amy is happy in loving me as a brother.She
shall never be unhappy in this home if I can prevent it."Maggie entered heart and soul into Webb's cause, for he was a great
favorite with her.He was kind to her children, and in a quiet way taught
them almost as much as they learned at school.He went to his work with
mind much relieved, for she and his mother were the only ones that he
feared might surmise his feeling, and by manner or remark reveal it to
Amy, thus destroying their unembarrassed relations, and perhaps his
chance to win the girl's heart.CHAPTER LVII

OCTOBER HUES AND HARVESTS


Burt's interview with his parents, their mingled surprise, pleasure, and
disappointment, and their deep sympathy, need not be dwelt upon.Clifford was desirous of first seeing Amy, and satisfying himself that
she did not in the slightest degree feel herself slighted or treated in
bad faith, but his wife, with her low laugh, said: "Rest assured, father,
Burt is right.He has won nothing more from Amy than sisterly love,
though I had hoped that he might in time.We shall keep Amy, and gain a new daughter that we have already learned
to admire and love."Burt's mind was too full of the one great theme to remember what Mr.Hargrove had said about the Western land, and when at last Miss Hargrove
came to say good-by, with a blushing consciousness quite unlike her usual
self-possession, he was enchanted anew, and so were all the household.The old people's reception seemed like a benediction; Amy banished the
faintest trace of doubt by her mirthful ecstasies; and after their
mountain experience there was no ice to break between Gertrude and
Maggie.The former was persuaded to defer her trip to New York until the morrow,
and so Amy would have her nutting expedition after all.When Leonard came
down to dinner, Burt took Gertrude's hand, and said, "Now, Len, this is
your only chance to give your consent.You can't have any dinner till you
do."His swift, deprecating look at Amy's laughing face reassured him."Well,"
he said, slowly, as if trying to comprehend it all, "I do believe I'm
growing old.When _did_ all this take
place?""Your eyesight is not to blame, Leonard," said his wife, with much
superiority."It's because you are only a man.""That's all I ever pretended to be."Then, with a dignity that almost
surprised Gertrude, he, as eldest brother, welcomed her in simple,
heartfelt words.At the dinner-table Miss Hargrove referred to the Western land.Burt laid
down his knife and fork, and exclaimed, "I declare, I forgot all about
it!"Miss Hargrove laughed heartily as she said, "A high tribute to me!"and
then made known her father's statement that the Clifford tract in the
West adjoined his own, that it would soon be very valuable, and that he
was interested in the railroad approaching it."I left him," she
concluded, "poring over his maps, and he told me to say to you, sir" (to
Mr.Clifford), "that he wished to see you soon.""How about the four-leaved clover now?"In the afternoon they started for the chestnut-trees.Webb carried a light
ladder, and both he and Burt had dressed themselves in close-fitting
flannel suits for climbing.The orchard, as they passed through it,
presented a beautiful autumn picture.Great heaps of yellow and red cheeked
apples were upon the ground; other varieties were in barrels, some headed
up and ready for market, while Mr.Clifford was giving the final cooperage
to other barrels as fast as they were filled."Father can still head up a barrel better than any of us," Leonard
remarked to Miss Hargrove."Well, my dear," said the old gentleman, "I've had over half a century's
experience.""It's time I obtained some idea of rural affairs," said Gertrude to Webb."There seem to be many different kinds of apples here."Yes, as easily as you know different dress fabrics at Arnold's.Those
umbrella-shaped trees are Rhode Island greenings; those that are rather
long and slender branching are yellow bell-flowers; and those with short
and stubby branches and twigs are the old-fashioned dominies.Don't you see how green the fruit is?It will not be
in perfection till next March.Not only a summer, but an autumn and a
winter are required to perfect that superb apple, but then it becomes one
of Nature's triumphs.Some of those heaps on the ground will furnish
cider and vinegar.Nuts, cider, and a wood fire are among the privations
of a farmer's life.""Farming, as you carry it on, appears to me a fine art.How very full
some of the trees are!and others look as if they had been half picked
over."The largest and ripest apples are taken
off first, and the rest of the fruit improves wonderfully in two or three
weeks.By this course we greatly increase both the quality and the bulk
of the crop.""You are very happy in your calling, Webb.How strange it seems for me to
be addressing you as Webb!""It does not seem so strange to me; nor does it seem strange that I am
talking to you in this way.I soon recognized that you were one of those
fortunate beings in whom city life had not quenched nature."They had fallen a little behind the others, and were out of ear-shot."I think," she said, hesitatingly and shyly, "that I had an ally in you
all along."He laughed and replied, "At one time I was very dubious over my
expedition to Fort Putnam.""I imagine that in suggesting that expedition you put in two words for
yourself.""I wish you might be as happy as I am.I'm not blind either, and I wonder
that Amy is so unconscious.""I hope she will remain so until she awakens as naturally as from sleep.She has never had a brother, and as such I try to act toward her.My one
thought is her happiness, and, perhaps, I can secure it in no other way.I feared long since that you had guessed my secret, and am grateful that
you have not suggested it to Amy.Few would have shown so much delicacy
and consideration.""I'm not sure that you are right, Webb.If Amy knew of your feeling, it
would influence her powerfully."Yes, it was necessary that she should misunderstand me, and think of me
as absorbed in things remote from her life.The knowledge you suggest
might make her very sad, for there never was a gentler-hearted girl.Please use it to prevent the constraint which might
arise between us."Burt now joined them with much pretended jealousy, and they soon reached
the trees, which, under the young men's vigorous blows, rained down the
prickly burrs, downy chestnuts, and golden leaves.Blue jays screamed
indignantly from the mountain-side, and squirrels barked their protest at
the inroads made upon their winter stores.As the night approached the
air grew chilly, and Webb remarked that frost was coming at last.He
hastened home before the others to cover up certain plants that might be
sheltered through the first cold snap.The tenderer ones had long since
been taken up and prepared for winter blooming.To Amy's inquiry where Johnnie was, Maggie had replied that she had gone
nutting by previous engagement with Mr.Alvord, and as the party returned
in the glowing evening they met the oddly assorted friends with their
baskets well filled.In the eyes of the recluse there was a gentler
expression, proving that Johnnie's and Nature's ministry had not been
wholly in vain.He glanced swiftly from Burt to Miss Hargrove, then at
Amy, and a faint suggestion of a smile hovered about his mouth.He was
about to leave them abruptly when Johnnie interposed, pleading: "Mr.Alvord, don't go home till I pick you some of your favorite heart's-ease,
as you call my <DW29>s.They have grown to be as large and beautiful as
they were last spring.Do you know, in the hot weather they were almost
as small as johnny-jumpers?but I wouldn't let 'em be called by that
name.""They will ever be heart's-ease to me, Johnnie-doubly so when you give
them," and he followed her to the garden.In the evening a great pitcher of cider fresh from the press, flanked by
dishes of golden fall pippins and grapes, was placed on the table.The
young people roasted chestnuts on hickory coals, and every one, even to
the invalid, seemed to glow with a kindred warmth and happiness.The city
belle contrasted the true home-atmosphere with the grand air of a city
house, and thanked God for her choice.At an early hour she said good-by
for a brief time and departed with Burt.He was greeted with stately
courtesy by Mrs.Hargrove herself, whom her husband and the prospective
value of the Western land had reconciled to the momentous event.Burt and
Gertrude were formally engaged, and he declared his intention of
accompanying her to the city to procure the significant diamond.After the culminating scenes of Burt's little drama, life went on very
serenely and quietly at the Clifford home.Out of school hours Alf,
Johnnie, and Ned vied with the squirrels in gathering their hoard of
various nuts.The boughs in the orchard grew lighter daily.Frost came as
Webb had predicted, and dahlias, salvias, and other flowers, that had
flamed and glowed till almost the middle of October, turned black in one
morning's sun.The butternut-trees had lost their foliage, and countless
leaves were fluttering down in every breeze like many-hued gems.The
richer bronzed colors of the oak were predominating in the landscape, and
only the apple, cherry, and willow trees about the house kept up the
green suggestion of summer.CHAPTER LVIII

THE MOONLIGHT OMEN


Webb permitted no marked change in his manner.He toiled steadily with
Leonard in gathering the fall produce and in preparing for winter, but
Amy noticed that his old preoccupied look was passing away.Daily he
appeared to grow more genial and to have more time and thought for her.With increasing wonder she learned the richness and fulness of his mind.In the evenings he read aloud to them all with his strong, musical
intonation, in which the author's thought was emphasized so clearly that
it seemed to have double the force that it possessed when she read the
same words herself.He found time for occasional rambles and horseback
excursions, and was so companionable during long rainy days that they
seemed to her the brightest of the week.Maggie smiled to herself and saw
that Webb's spell was working.He was making himself so quietly and
unobtrusively essential to Amy that she would find half of her life gone
if she were separated from him.Gertrude returned for a short time, and then went to the city for the
winter.He was much in New York, and
often with Mr.Hargrove, from whom he was receiving instructions in
regard to his Western expedition.That gentleman's opinion of Burt's
business capacity grew more favorable daily, for the young fellow now
proposed to show that he meant to take life in earnest."If this lasts he
will make a trusty young lieutenant," the merchant thought, "and I can
make his fortune while furthering mine."Burt had plenty of brains and
good executive ability to carry out the wiser counsels of others, while
his easy, vivacious manner won him friends and acceptance everywhere.It was arranged, after his departure, that Amy should visit her friend in
the city, and Webb looked forward to her absence with dread and
self-depreciation, fearing that he should suffer by contrast with the
brilliant men of society, and that the quiet country life would seem
dull, indeed, thereafter.Before Amy went on this visit there came an Indian summer morning in
November, that by its soft, dreamy beauty wooed every one out of doors."Amy," said Webb, after dinner, "suppose we drive over to West Point and
return by moonlight."She was delighted with the idea, and they were soon
slowly ascending the mountain.He felt that this was his special
opportunity, not to break her trustful unconsciousness, but to reveal his
power to interest her and make impressions that should be enduring.He
exerted every faculty to please, recalling poetic and legendary allusions
connected with the trees, plants, and scenes by which they were passing."Oh, Webb, how you idealize nature!""You make every object
suggest something fanciful, beautiful, or entertaining.How have you
learned to do it?""As I told you last Easter Sunday--how long ago it seems--if I have any
power for such idealization it is largely through your influence.My
knowledge was much like the trees as they then appeared.I was prepared
for better things, but the time for them had not yet come.I had studied
the material world in a material sort of way, employing my mind with
facts that were like the bare branches and twigs.You awakened in me a
sense of the beautiful side of nature.Who can
explain the rapid development of foliage and flowers when all is ready?""But, Webb, you appeared, during the summer, to go back to your old
materiality worse than ever.You made me feel that I had no power to do
anything for you.You treated me as if I were your very little sister who
would have to go to school a few years before I could be your companion.""Those were busy days," he replied, laughing."Besides," he added,
hesitatingly, "Burt was at one time inclined to be jealous.Of course, it
was very absurd in him, but I suppose lovers are always a little absurd."I saw whither Burt was drifting long
ago--at the time of the great flood which swept away things of more value
than my silly expectations.What an unsophisticated little goose I was!I
suppose Johnnie expects to be married some day, and in much the same way
I looked forward to woman's fate; and since you all seemed to wish that
it should be Burt, I thought, 'Why not?'Wasn't it lucky for Burt, and,
indeed, for all of you, that I was not a grown-up and sentimental young
woman?Hargrove, by uniting his interests with yours in the West,
will make your fortunes, and Burt will bring you a lovely sister.It
pleases me to see how Gertrude is learning to like you.I used to be
provoked with her at first, because she didn't appreciate you.Do you
know, I think you ought to write?You could make people fall in love with
nature.Americans don't care half as much for out-door life and pursuits
as the English.It seems to me that city life cannot compare with that of
the country.""You may think differently after you have been a few weeks in Gertrude's
elegant home."They had paused again on the brow of Cro' Nest, and were looking out on
the wide landscape."No, Webb," she said; "her home, no doubt, is
elegant, but it is artificial.This is simple and grand, and to-day, seen
through the soft haze, is lovely to me beyond all words.I honestly half
regret that I am going to town.Of course, I shall enjoy myself--I always
do with Gertrude--but the last few quiet weeks have been so happy and
satisfying that I dread any change.""Think of the awful vacuum that your absence will make in the old home!""Well, I'm a little glad; I want to be missed.But I shall write to you
and tell you of all the frivolous things we are doing.Besides, you must
come to see me as often as you can."They saw evening parade, the moon rising meanwhile over Sugarloaf
Mountain, and filling the early twilight with a soft radiance.The music
seemed enchanting, for their hearts were attuned to it.As the long line
of cadets shifted their guns from "carry arms" to "shoulder arms" with
instantaneous action, Webb said that the muskets sent out a shivering
sound like that of a tree almost ready to fall under the last blows of an
axe.Webb felt that should he exist millions of ages he should never forget the
ride homeward.The moon looked through the haze like a veiled beauty, and
in its softened light Amy's pure, sweet profile was endowed with ethereal
beauty.The beech trees, with their bleached leaves still clinging to them,
were almost spectral, and the oaks in their bronzed foliage stood like
black giants by the roadside.There were suggestive vistas of light and
shadow that were full of mystery, making it easy to believe that on a night
like this the mountain was haunted by creatures as strange as the fancy
could shape.The supreme gift of a
boundless love overflowed his heart to his very lips.She was so near, and
the spell of her loveliness so strong, that at times he felt that he must
give it expression, but he ever restrained himself.His words might bring
pain and consternation to the peaceful face.She was alone with him, and
there would be no escape should he speak now.No; he had resolved to wait
till her heart awoke by its own impulses, and he would keep his purpose
even through the witchery of that moonlight drive."How strangely isolated
we are," he thought, "that such feeling as mine can fill my very soul with
its immense desire, and she not be aware of anything but my quiet,
fraternal manner!"As they were descending the home <DW72> of the mountain they witnessed a
rare and beautiful sight.A few light clouds had gathered around the
moon, and these at last opened in a rift.The rays of light through the
misty atmosphere created the perfect colors of a rainbow, and this
phenomenon took the remarkable form of a shield, its base resting upon
one cloud, and its point extending into a little opening in the cloud
above."Was there ever anything so
strange and lovely?"Webb checked his horse, and they looked at the vision with wonder."I
never saw anything to equal that," said Webb.she asked, turning a little from him that she
might look upward, and leaning on his shoulder with the unconsciousness
of a child."Let us make it one, dear sister Amy," he said, drawing her nearer to
him."Let it remind you, as you recall it, that as far as I can I will
ever shield you from every evil of life."As he spoke the rainbow colors
became wonderfully distinct, and then faded slowly away.Her head drooped
lower on his shoulder, and she said, dreamily:

"It seems to me that I never was so happy before in my life as I am now.You are so different, and can be so much to me, now that your old absurd
constraint is gone.Oh, Webb, you used to make me so unhappy!You made me
feel that you had found me out--how little I knew, and that it was a bore
to have to talk with me and explain.I went everywhere with papa, and he always appeared to think
of me as a little girl.And then during the last year or two of his life
he was so ill that I did not do much else than watch over him with fear
and trembling, and try to nurse him and beguile the hours that were so
full of pain and weakness.But I'm not contented to be ignorant, and you
can teach me so much.I fairly thrill with excitement and feeling
sometimes when you are reading a fine or beautiful thing.If I can feel
that way I can't be stupid, can I?""Think how much faster I could learn this winter if you would direct my
reading, and explain what is obscure!""I will very gladly do anything you wish.There is a stupidity of heart which is
far worse than that of the mind, a selfish callousness in regard to
others and their rights and feelings, which mars the beauty of some women
worse than physical deformity.From the day you entered our home as a
stranger, graceful tact, sincerity, and the impulse of ministry have
characterized your life.Can you imagine that mere cleverness, trained
mental acuteness, and a knowledge of facts can take the place of these
traits?No man can love unless he imagines that a woman has these
qualities, and bitter will be his disappointment if he finds them
wanting."Her laugh rang out musically on the still air."I believe you have constructed an ideally perfect
creature out of nature, and that you hold trysts with her on moonlight
nights, you go out to walk so often alone.Well, well, I won't be jealous
of such a sister-in-law, but I want to keep you a little while longer
before you follow Burt's example.""I shall never give you a sister-in-law, Amy.""You don't know what you'll do.If you ever love, it will be for always; and I don't
like to think of it.I'd like to keep you just as you are.Now that you
see how selfish I am, where is woman's highest charm?"Webb laughed, and urged his horse into a sharp trot."I am unchangeable
in my opinions too, as far as you are concerned," he remarked."She is
not ready yet," was his silent thought.When she came down to the late supper her eyes were shining with
happiness, and Maggie thought the decisive hour had come; but in answer
to a question about the drive, Amy said, "I couldn't have believed that
so much enjoyment was to be had in one afternoon.Webb is a brother worth
having, and I'm sorry I'm going to New York.""Oh, you are excellent, as far as you go, but you are so wrapped up in
Maggie that you are not of much account; and as for Burt, he is more over
head and ears than you are.Even if a woman was in love, I should think
she would like a man to be sensible."you don't know what you are talking About," said Maggie.I suppose it is a kind of disease, and that all are more
or less out of their heads.""We've been out of our heads a good many years, mother, haven't we?""Well," said Leonard, "I just hope Amy will catch the disease, and have
it very bad some day."When I do, I'll send for Dr.A few days later Webb took her to New York, and left her with her friend."Don't be persuaded into staying very long," he found opportunity to say,
in a low tone."Indeed I won't; I'm homesick already;" and she looked after him very
wistfully.Gertrude looked so hurt and disappointed
when she spoke of returning, and had planned so much, that days
lengthened into weeks.CHAPTER LIX

THE HOSE REVEALS ITS HEART


Webb returned to a region that was haunted.Wherever he went, a presence
was there before him.In every room, on the lawn, in the garden, in lanes
no longer shaded, but carpeted with brown, rustling leaves, on mountain
roads, he saw Amy with almost the vividness of actual vision, as he had
seen her in these places from the time of her first coming.At church he
created her form in her accustomed seat, and his worship was a little
confused.She had asked him to write, and he made home life and the
varying aspects of nature real to her.His letters, however, were so
impersonal that she could read the greater part of them to Gertrude, who
had resolved to be pleased out of good-will to Webb, and with the
intention of aiding his cause.But she soon found herself expressing
genuine wonder and delight at their simple, vigorous diction, their
subtile humor, and the fine poetic images they often suggested."Oh,
Amy," she said, "I couldn't have believed it.I don't think he himself is
aware of his power of expression.""He has read and observed so much," Amy replied, "that he has much to
express.""It's more than that," said Gertrude; "there are touches here and there
which mere knowledge can't account for.They have a delicacy and beauty
which seem the result of woman's influence, and I believe it is yours.I
should think you would be proud of him.""I am," she answered, with exultation and heightened color, "but it seems
absurd to suppose that such a little ignoramus as I am can help him
much."Meanwhile, to all appearance, Webb maintained the even tenor of his way.He had been so long schooled in patience that he waited and hoped on in
silence as before, and busied himself incessantly.The last of the corn
was husked, and the golden treasure stored.The stalks were stacked near
the barn for winter use, and all the labors of the year were rounded out
and completed.Twice he went to the city to see Amy, and on one of these
occasions he was a guest at a large party given in her honor.During much
of the evening he was dazzled by her beauty, and dazed by her
surroundings.Her father had had her instructed carefully in dancing, and
she and Burt had often waltzed together, but he could scarcely believe
his eyes as she appeared on the floor unsurpassed in beauty and grace,
her favor sought by all.Was that the simple girl who on the shaggy sides
of Storm King had leaned against his shoulder?Miss Hargrove gave him little time for such musings.She, as hostess,
often took his arm and made him useful.The ladies found him reserved
rather than shy, but he was not long among the more mature and thoughtful
men present before a knot gathered around him, and some of Mr.Hargrove's
more intimate friends ventured to say, "There seems to be plenty of
brains in the family into which your daughter is to enter."After an hour or two had passed, and Amy had not had a chance to speak to
him, he began to look so disconsolate that she came and whispered,
"What's the matter, old fellow?""Oh, Amy," he replied, discontentedly, "I wish we were back on Storm
King."So do I," she said, "and so we will be many a time again.But you are
not out of place here.I heard one lady remarking how'reserved and
_distingue_ you were, and another," she added, with a flash of her
ever-ready mirthfulness, "said you were 'deliciously homely.'I was just
delighted with that compliment," and she flitted away to join her partner
in the dance.Webb brightened up amazingly after this, and before he
departed in the "wee sma' hours," when the rooms were empty, Gertrude
gave him a chance for a brief, quiet talk, which proved that Amy's heart
was still in the Highlands, even if he did not yet possess it.Burt would not return till late in December; but Amy came home about the
middle of the month, and received an ovation that was enough "to turn any
one's head," she declared.Their old quiet life was resumed, and Webb
watched keenly for any discontent with it."I've had my little fling," she said, "and I suppose it was
time I saw more of the world and society, but oh, what a refuge and haven
of rest the old place is!Gertrude is lovely, her father very gallant and
polite, but Mrs.Hargrove's stateliness oppresses me, and in society I
felt that I had to take a grain of salt with everything said to me.Gertrude showed her sense in preferring a home.I was in some superb
houses in the city that did not seem like homes."Webb, in his solicitude that the country-house should not appear dull,
found time to go out with her on pleasant days, and to interest her
deeply in a course of reading.It was a season of leisure; but his mother
began to smile to herself as she saw how absorbed he was in his pupil.The nights grew colder, the stars gained a frosty glitter, the ground was
rock-like, and the ponds were covered with a glare of black ice.Amy was
eager to learn to skate, and Webb found his duty of instructor
delightful.Little danger of her falling, although, with a beginner's
awkwardness, she essayed to do so often; strong arms were ever near and
ready, and any one would have been glad to catch Amy in such peril.They were now looking forward to Burt's return and the holiday season,
which Gertrude would spend with them.Not merely the shops, but busy and stealthy fingers, would furnish the
gifts.Webb had bought his present for Amy, but had also burned the
midnight oil in the preparation of another--a paper for a magazine, and
it had been accepted.He had planned and composed it while at work
stripping the husks from the yellow corn, superintending the wood teams
and the choppers in the mountain, and aiding in cutting from an adjacent
pond the crystal blocks of ice--the stored coolness for the coming
summer.Then while others thought him sleeping he wrote and rewrote the
thoughts he had harvested during the day.One of his most delightful tasks, however, was in aiding Amy to embower
the old house in wreaths and festoons of evergreens.The rooms grew into
aromatic bowers.Autumn leaves and ferns gave to the heavier decorations
a light, airy beauty which he had never seen before.Grace itself Amy
appeared as she mounted the step-ladder and reached here and there,
twining and coaxing everything into harmony.What was the effect of all this companionship on her mind?She least of
all could have answered: she did not analyze.She was being carried forward on a shining tide of happiness, and
yet its motion was so even, quiet, and strong that there was nothing to
disturb her maidenly serenity.If Webb had been any one but Webb, and if
she had been in the habit of regarding all men as possible admirers, she
would have understood herself long before this.If she had been brought
up with brothers in her own home she would have known that she welcomed
this quiet brother with a gladness that had a deeper root than sisterly
affection.But the fact that he was Webb, the quiet, self-controlled man
who had called her sister Amy for a year, made his presence, his deep
sympathy with her and for her, seem natural.His approaches had been so
gradual that he was stealing into her heart as spring enters a flower.You can never name the first hour of its presence; you take no note of
the imperceptible yet steady development.The process is quiet, yet vital
and sure, and at last there comes an hour when the bud is ready to open.That time was near, and Webb hoped that it was.His tones were now and
then so tender and gentle that she looked at him a little wonderingly,
but his manner was quiet and far removed from that of the impetuous Burt.There was a warmth in it, however, like the increasing power of the sun,
and in human hearts bleak December can be the spring-time as truly as
May.It was the twenty-third--one of the stormiest days of a stormy month.The
snowflakes were whirling without, and making many a circle in the gale
before joining their innumerable comrades that whitened the ground.The
wind sighed and soughed about the old house as it had done a year before,
but Webb and Amy were armed against its mournfulness.They were in the
parlor, on whose wide hearth glowed an ample fire.Burt and Gertrude were
expected on the evening train."Gertie is coming home through the snow just as I did," said Amy,
fastening a spray of mistletoe that a friend had sent her from England to
the chandelier; "and the same old warm welcome awaits her.""What a marvellous year it has been!"Burt is engaged to one of whose
existence he did not know a year ago.He has been out West, and found
that you have land that will make you all rich.""Are these the greatest marvels of the year, Amy?"I didn't know you a year ago to-day, and now
I seem to have known you always, you great patient, homely old
fellow--'deliciously homely.'"The eyes of scores of young fellows looked at you that evening as if you
were deliciously handsome.""And you looked at me one time as if you hadn't a friend in the world,
and you wanted to be back in your native wilds.""Not without you, Amy; and you said you wished you were looking at the
rainbow shield with me again.""Oh, I didn't say all that; and then I saw you needed heartening up a
little."You were dancing with a terrible swell, worth, it was
said, half a million, who was devouring you with his eyes.""I'm all here, thank you, and you look as if you were doing some
devouring yourself."Yes, some color, but it's just as Nature arranged it, and you know
Nature's best work always fascinates me."There, don't you think that is arranged
well?"and she stood beneath the mistletoe looking up critically at it."Let me see if it is," and he advanced to her side."This is the only
test," he said, and quick as a flash he encircled her with his arm and
pressed a kiss upon her lips.She sprang aloof and looked at him with dilating eyes.He had often
kissed her before, and she had thought nothing more of it than of a
brother's salute.Was it a subtile, mysterious power in the mistletoe
itself with which it had been endowed by ages of superstition?Was that
kiss like the final ray of the Jane sun that opens the heart of the rose
when at last it is ready to expand?She looked at him wonderingly,
tremblingly, the color of the rose mounting higher and higher, and
deepening as if the blood were coming from the depths of her heart.In answer to her wondering, questioning look, he only bent
full upon her his dark eyes that had held hers once before in a moment of
terror.She saw his secret in their depths at last, the devotion, the
love, which she herself had unsuspectingly said would "last always."She
took a faltering step toward him, then covered her burning face with her
hands."Amy," he said, taking her gently in his arms, "do you understand me now?Dear, blind little girl, I have been worshipping all these months, and
you have not known it.""I--I thought you were in love with nature," she whispered."So I am, and you are nature in its sweetest and highest embodiment.Every beautiful thing in nature has long suggested you to me.It seems to me now that I
have loved you almost from the first hour I saw you.I have known that I
loved you ever since that June evening when you left me in the rose
garden.Have I not proved that I can be patient and wait?"She only pressed her burning face closer upon his shoulder."It's all
growing clear now," she again whispered."I can be 'only your brother,' if you so wish," he said, gravely."Your
happiness is my first thought."She looked up at him shyly, tears in her eyes, and a smile hovering about
her tremulous lips."I don't think I understood myself any better than I
did you.I never had a brother, and--and--I don't believe I loved you
just right for a brother;" and her face was hidden again.His eyes went up to heaven, as if he meant that his mating should be
recognized there.Then gently stroking her brown hair, he asked, "Then I
shan't have to wait, Amy?"cried Webb, lifting the dewy, flower-like
face and kissing it again and again."Oh, I beg your pardon; I didn't know," began Mr.Clifford from the
doorway, and was about to make a hasty and excited retreat."A year ago you received this dear girl as
your daughter.She has consented to make the tie closer still if
possible."The old gentleman took Amy in his arms for a moment, and then said, "This
is too good to keep to myself for a moment," and he hastened the
blushing, laughing girl to his wife, and exclaimed, "See what I've
brought you for a Christmas present.See what that sly, silent Webb has
been up to.He has been making love to our Amy right under our noses, and
we didn't know it.""_You_ didn't know it, father; mother's eyes are not so blind.Amy,
darling, I've been hoping and praying for this.You have made a good
choice, my dear, if it is his mother that says it.Webb will never
change, and he will always be as gentle and good to you as he has been to
me.""Well, well, well," said Mr.Clifford, "our cup is running over, sure
enough.Maggie, come here," he called, as he heard her step in the hall.I once felt a little like grumbling because we
hadn't a daughter, and now I have three, and the best and prettiest in
the land."Didn't I, Webb--as long ago as last October, too?""Oh, Webb, you ought to have told me first," said Amy, reproachfully,
when they were alone."I did not tell Maggie; she saw," Webb answered.Then, taking a rosebud
which she had been wearing, he pushed open the petals with his finger,
and asked, "Who told me that 'this is no way for a flower to bloom'?I've
watched and waited till your heart was ready, Amy."And so the time flew
in mutual confidences, and the past grew clear when illumined by love.said Amy, with a mingled sigh and laugh."There you were
growing as gaunt as a scarecrow, and I loving you all the time.If you had looked at Gertrude as Burt did I should
have found myself out long ago.Why hadn't you the sense to employ Burt's
tactics?""Because I had resolved that nature should be my sole ally.Was not my
kiss under the mistletoe a better way of awakening my sleeping beauty
than a stab of jealousy?""Yes, Webb, dear, patient Webb.The rainbow shield was a true omen, and I
am sheltered indeed."CHAPTER LX

CHRISTMAS LIGHTS AND SHADOWS


Leonard had long since gone to the depot, and now the chimes of his
returning bells announced that Burt and Gertrude were near.To them both
it was in truth a coming home.Gertrude rushed in, followed by the
exultant Burt, her brilliant eyes and tropical beauty rendered tenfold
more effective by the wintry twilight without; and she received a welcome
that accorded with her nature.She was hardly in Amy's room, which she
was to share, before she looked in eager scrutiny at her friend.Oh, you little
wild-flower, you've found out that he is saying his prayers to you at
last, have you?Evidently he hasn't said them in vain.Oh, Amy darling, I was true to you and didn't
lose Burt either."Maggie had provided a feast, and Leonard beamed on the table and on every
one, when something in Webb and Amy's manner caught his attention."This
occasion," he began, "reminds me of a somewhat similar one a year ago
to-morrow night.It is my good fortune to bring lovely women into this
household.My first and best effort was made when I brought Maggie.Then
I picked up a little girl at the depot, and she grew into a tall, lovely
creature on the way home, didn't she, Johnnie?And now to-night I've
brought in a princess from the snow, and one of these days poor Webb will
be captured by a female of the MacStinger type, for he will never muster
up courage enough--What on earth are you all laughing about?""Thank you," said Amy, looking like a peony."You had better put your head under Maggie's wing and subside," Webb
added.Then, putting his arm about Amy, he asked, "Is this a female of
the MacStinger type?""Well," said he, at last, "when
_did_ this happen?When I was
courting, the whole neighborhood was talking about it, and knew I was
accepted long before I did.Did you see all this going on, Maggie?""Now, I don't believe Amy saw it herself," cried Leonard, half
desperately, and laughter broke out anew."Oh, Amy, I'm so glad!"said Burt, and he gave her the counterpart of the
embrace that had turned the bright October evening black to Webb."To think that Webb should have got such a prize!""Well, well, the boys in this family are in luck.""It will be my turn next," cried Johnnie."No, sir; I'm the oldest," Alf protested."Let's have supper," Ned remarked, removing his thumb from his mouth."Score one for Ned," said Burt."There is at least one member of the
family whose head is not turned by all these marvellous events."Can the sunshine and fragrance of a June day be photographed?No more can
the light and gladness of that long, happy evening be portrayed.Clifford held Gertrude's hand as she had Amy's when receiving her as a
daughter.The beautiful girl, whose unmistakable metropolitan air was
blended with gentle womanly grace, had a strong fascination for the
invalid.She kindled the imagination of the recluse, and gave her a
glimpse into a world she had never known."Webb," said Amy, as they were parting for the night, "I can see a sad,
pale orphan girl clad in mourning.I can see you kissing her for the
first time.I had a strange little thrill at heart
then, and you said, 'Come to me, Amy, when you are in trouble.'There is
one thing that troubles me to-night.All whom I so dearly love know of my
happiness but papa."Tell it to him, Amy," he answered, gently, "and tell it to God."There were bustle and renewed mystery on the following day.Astonishing-looking packages were smuggled from one room to another.Ned created a succession of panics, and at last the ubiquitous and
garrulous little urchin had to be tied into a chair.Johnnie and Alf
were in the seventh heaven of anticipation, and when Webb brought Amy
a check for fifty dollars, and told her that it was the proceeds of
his first crop from his brains, and that she must spend the money, she
went into Mr.Clifford's room waving it as if it were a trophy such as
no knight had ever brought to his lady-love."Of course, I'll spend it," she cried.It
shall go into books that we can read together.What's that agricultural
jargon of yours, Webb, about returning as much as possible to the soil?We'll return this to the soil," she said, kissing his forehead, "although
I think it is too rich for me already."In the afternoon she and Webb, with a sleigh well laden, drove into the
mountains on a visit to Lumley.He had repaired the rough, rocky lane
leading through the wood to what was no longer a wretched hovel.The
inmates had been expecting this visit, and Lumley rushed bareheaded
out-of-doors the moment he heard the bells.Although he had swept a path
from his door again and again, the high wind would almost instantly drift
in the snow.Poor Lumley had never heard of Sir Walter Raleigh or Queen
Elizabeth, but he had given his homage to a better queen, and with loyal
impulse he instantly threw off his coat, and laid it on the snow, that
Amy might walk dry-shod into the single room that formed his home.She
and Webb smiled significantly at each other, and then the young girl put
her hand into that of the mountaineer as he helped her from the sleigh,
and said "Merry Christmas!"with a smile that brought tears into the eyes
of the grateful man."Yer making no empty wish, Miss Amy.I never thought sich a Christmas 'ud
ever come to me or mine.But come in, come in out of the cold wind, an'
see how you've changed everything.Webb, and I'll tie
an' blanket your hoss.Lord, to think that sich a May blossom 'ud go into
my hut!"Lumley, neatly clad in some dark woollen material,
made a queer, old-fashioned courtesy that her husband had had her
practice for the occasion.But the baby, now grown into a plump, healthy
child, greeted her benefactress with nature's own grace, crowing,
laughing, and calling, "Pitty lady; nice lady," with exuberant welcome.The inmates did not now depend for precarious warmth upon two logs,
reaching across a dirty floor and pushed together, but a neat box,
painted green, was filled with billets of wood.The carpeted floor was
scrupulously clean, and so was the bright new furniture.A few evergreen
wreaths hung on the walls with the pictures that Amy had given, and on
the mantel was her photograph--poor Lumley's patron saint.Webb brought in his armful of gifts, and Amy took the child on her lap
and opened a volume of dear old "Mother Goose," profusely illustrated in
 prints--that classic that appeals alike to the hearts of
children, whether in mountain hovels or city palaces.The man looked on
as if dazed.Webb," he said, in his loud whisper, "I once saw a
picter of the Virgin and Child.Oh, golly, how she favors it!"Lumley," Amy began, "I think your housekeeping does you much
credit.I've not seen a neater room anywhere.""Well, mum, my ole man's turned over a new leaf sure nuff.There's no
livin' with him unless everythink is jesso, an, I guess it's better so,
too.Ef I let things git slack, he gits mighty savage.""You must try to be patient, Mr.You've made great changes for
the better, but you must remember that old ways can't be broken up in a
moment.""Lor' bless yer, Miss Amy, there's no think like breakin' off short,
there's nothink like turnin' the corner sharp, and fightin' the devil
tooth and nail.It's an awful tussle at first, an' I thought I was goin'
to knuckle under more'n once.So I would ef it hadn't 'a ben fer you, but
you give me this little ban', Miss Amy, an' looked at me as if I wa'n't a
beast, an' it's ben a liftin' me up ever sence.Oh, I've had good folks
talk at me an' lecter, an' I ben in jail, but it all on'y made me mad.The best on 'em wouldn't 'a teched me no more than they would a rattler,
sich as we killed on the mountain.But you guv me yer han', Miss Amy, an'
thar's mine on it agin; I'm goin' to be a _man_."She took the great horny palm in both her hands."You make me very
happy," she said, simply, looking at him above the head of his child,
"and I'm sure your wife is going to help you.I shall enjoy the holidays
far more for this visit.You've told us good news, and we've got good
news for you and your wife."Yes, Lumley," said Webb, clapping the man on the shoulder, "famous news.This little girl has been helping me just as much as she has you, and she
has promised to help me through life.One of these days we shall have a
home of our own, and you shall have a cottage near it, and the little
girl here that you've named Amy shall go to school and have a better
chance than you and your wife have had."exclaimed the man, almost breaking out into a
hornpipe."The Lord on'y knows what will happen ef things once git a
goin' right!Webb, thar's my han' agin'.Ef yer'd gone ter heaven fer
her, yer couldn't 'a got sich a gell.Well, well, give me a chance on yer
place, an' I'll work fer yer all the time, even nights an' Sundays."The child dropped her books and toys,
and clung to Amy."She knows yer; she knows all about yer," said the
delighted father."Well, ef yer must go, yer'll take suthin' with us;"
and from a great pitcher of milk he filled several goblets, and they all
drank to the health of little Amy."Yer'll fin' half-dozen pa'triges
under the seat, Miss Amy," he said, as they drove away."I was bound I'd
have some kind of a present fer yer."She waved her hand back to him, and saw him standing bareheaded in the
cutting wind, looking after her."Poor old Lumley was right," said Webb, drawing her to him; "I do feel as
if I had received my little girl from heaven.We will give those people a
chance, and try to turn the law of heredity in the right direction."Alvord sat over his lonely hearth,
his face buried in his hands.The day had been terribly long and
torturing; memory had presented, like mocking spectres, his past and what
it might have been.A sense of loneliness, a horror of great darkness,
overwhelmed him.Nature had grown cold and forbidding, and was losing its
power to solace.Johnnie, absorbed in her Christmas preparations, had not
been to see him for a long time.He had gone to inquire after her on the
previous evening, and through the lighted window of the Clifford home had
seen a picture that had made his own abode appear desolate indeed.In
despairing bitterness he had turned away, feeling that that happy home
was no more a place for him than was heaven.He had wandered out into the
storm for hours, like a lost spirit, and at last had returned and slept
in utter exhaustion.On the morning preceding Christmas memory awoke with
him, and as night approached he was sinking into sullen, dreary apathy.There was a light tap at the door, but he did not hear it.A child's face
peered in at his window, and Johnnie saw him cowering over his dying
fire.She had grown accustomed to his moods, and had learned to be
fearless, for she had banished his evil spells before.Therefore she
entered softly, laid down her bundles and stood beside him.she said, laying her hand on his shoulder.He started up,
and at the same moment a flickering blaze rose on the hearth, and
revealed the sunny-haired child standing beside him.If an angel had
come, the effect could not have been greater.Like all who are morbid, he
was largely under the dominion of imagination; and Johnnie, with her
fearless, gentle, commiserating eyes, had for him the potency of a
supernatural visitor.But the healthful, unconscious child had a better
power.Her words and touch brought saneness as well as hope.Alvord," she cried, "were you asleep?your fire is going
out, and your lamp is not lighted, and there is nothing ready for your
supper.What a queer man you are, for one who is so kind!Mamma said I
might come and spend a little of Christmas-eve with you, and bring my
gifts, and then that you would bring me home.I know how to fix up your
fire and light your lamp.and she bustled around, the embodiment of beautiful life.he said, taking her sweet face in his hands, and looking
into her clear eyes, "Heaven must have sent you.I was so lonely and sad
that I wished I had never lived."See what I've brought you,"
and she opened a book with the angels' song of "peace and good-will"
illustrated."Mamma says that whoever believes that ought to be happy,"
said the child."Yes, it's true for those who are like you and your mother."She leaned against him, and looked over his shoulder at the pictures.Alvord, mamma said the song was for you, too.Of course, mamma's
right.What else did He come for but to help people who are in trouble?I
read stories about Him every Sunday to mamma, and He was always helping
people who were in trouble, and who had done wrong.That's why we are
always glad on Christmas.You look at the book while I set your table."He did look at it till his eyes were blinded with tears, and like a sweet
refrain came the words.Half an hour later Leonard, with a kindly impulse, thought he would go to
take by the hand Johnnie's strange friend, and see how the little girl
was getting on.The scene within, as he passed the window, checked his
steps.Alvord's table, pouring tea for
him, chattering meanwhile with a child's freedom, and the hermit was
looking at her with such a smile on his haggard face as Leonard had never
seen there.He walked quietly home, deferring his call till the morrow,
feeling that Johnnie's spell must not be broken.Alvord put Johnnie down at her home, for he had
insisted on carrying her through the snow, and for the first time kissed
her, as he said:

"Good-by.You, to-night, have been like one of the angels that brought
the tidings of 'peace and good-will.'""I'm sorry for him, mamma!"said the little girl, after telling her
story, "for he's very lonely, and he's such a queer, nice man.Isn't it
funny that he should be so old, and yet not know why we keep Christmas?"Amy sang again the Christmas hymn that her own father and the father who
had adopted her had loved so many years before.Clifford, as he was fondly bidding her good-night, "how sweetly you have
fulfilled the hopes you raised one year ago!"Clifford had gone to her room, leaning on the arm of Gertrude.As
the invalid kissed her in parting, she said:

"You have beautiful eyes, my dear, and they have seen far more of the
world than mine, but, thank God, they are clear and true.Keep them so,
my child, that I may welcome you again to a better home than this."Once more "the old house stood silent and dark in the pallid landscape."The winds were hushed, as if the peace within had been breathed into the
very heart of Nature, and she, too, could rest in her wintry sleep.The
moon was obscured by a veil of clouds, and the outlines of the trees were
faint upon the snow.A shadowy form drew near; a man paused, and looked
upon the dwelling."If the angels' song could be heard anywhere to-night,
it should be over that home," Mr.Alvord murmured; but, even to his
morbid fancy, the deep silence of the night remained unbroken.He
returned to his home, and sat down in the firelight.A golden-haired
child again leaned upon his shoulder, and asked, "What else did He come
for but to help people who are in trouble, and who have done wrong?"Was it a voice deep in his own soul that was longing to
escape from evil?or was it a harmony far away in the sky, that whispered
of peace at last?That message from heaven is clearest where the need is
greatest.Hargrove's home was almost a palace, but its stately rooms were
desolate on Christmas-eve.He wandered restlessly through their
magnificence.He paid no heed to the costly furniture and costlier works
of art."Trurie was right," he muttered."What power have these things to
satisfy when the supreme need of the heart is unsatisfied?It seems as if
I could not sleep to-night without seeing her.There is no use in
disguising the truth that I'm losing her.Even on Christmas-eve she is
absent.It's late, and since I cannot see her, I'll see her gift;" and he
went to her room, where she had told him to look for her remembrance.To his surprise, he found that, according to her secret instructions, it
was lighted.He entered the dainty apartment, and saw the glow of autumn
leaves and the airy grace of ferns around the pictures and windows.He
started, for he almost saw herself, so true was the life-size and
lifelike portrait that smiled upon him.Beneath it were the words, "Merry
Christmas, papa!You have not lost me; you have only made me happy."The moon is again rising over old Storm King; the crystals that cover the
white fields and meadows are beginning to flash in its rays; the great
pine by the Clifford home is sighing and moaning.What heavy secret has
the old tree that it can sigh with such a group near as is now gathered
beneath it?Burt's black horse rears high as he reins him in, that
Gertrude may spring into the cutter, then speeds away like a shadow
through the moonlight Webb's steed is strong and quiet, like himself, and
as tireless.Amy steps to Webb's side, feeling it to be her place in very
truth.Sable Abram draws up next, with the great family sleigh, and in a
moment Alf is perched beside him.Then Leonard half smothers Johnnie and
Ned under the robes, and Maggie, about to pick her way through the snow,
finds herself taken up in strong arms, like one of the children, and is
with them.The chime of bells dies away in the distance.Wedding-bells
will be their echo.*       *       *       *       *

The merry Christmas-day has passed.Barkdale, and other friends have come and gone with their greetings;
the old people are left alone beside their cheery fire."Here we are, mother, all by ourselves, just as we were once before on
Christmas night, when you were as fair and blooming as Amy or Gertrude.Well, my dear, the long journey seems short to-night.I suppose the
reason is that you have been such good company.""Dear old father, the journey would have been long and weary indeed, had
I not had your strong arm to lean upon, and a love that didn't fade with
my roses.There is only one short journey before us now, father, and then
we shall know fully the meaning of the 'good tidings of great joy'
forever."She was looking away towards the place where the bird had
flown, and she seemed as if she had been weeping.Anything more beautiful, Arne had never seen or dreamed of in all
his life; the sun, too, had spread its gold over her and the place;
and the song still hovered round her, so that Arne thought,
breathed--nay, even his heart beat, in time with it.It seemed so
strange that the song which bore all his longing, _he_ had forgotten,
but _she_ had found.A tawny wasp flew round her in circles many times, till at last she
saw it and frightened it away with a flower-stalk, which she put up
as often as it came before her.Then she took up the book and opened
it, but she soon closed it again, sat as before, and began to hum
another song.He could hear it was "The Tree's early leaf-buds,"
though she often made mistakes, as if she did not quite remember
either the words or the tune.The verse she knew best was the last
one, and so she often repeated it; but she sang it thus:--

   "The Tree bore his berries, so mellow and red:
    'May I gather thy berries?''Yes; all thou canst see;
        Take them; all are for thee.'Said the Tree--trala--lala, trala, lala--said."Then she suddenly sprang up, scattering all the flowers around her,
and sang till the tune trembled through the air, and might have been
heard at Boeen.Arne had thought of coming forwards when she began
singing; he was just about to do so when she jumped up; then he felt
he _must_ come, but she went away.No!--There she skipped over the hillocks singing; here her hat fell
off, there she took it up again; here she picked a flower, there she
stood deep in the highest grass.It was a long while ere he ventured to peep out
again; at first he only raised his head; he could not see her: he
rose to his knees; still he could not see her: he stood upright; no
she was gone.He thought himself a miserable fellow; and some of the
tales he had heard at the nutting-party came into his mind.Now he would not go to the parsonage.He would not have the
newspapers; would not know anything about Christian.He would not go
home; he would go nowhere; he would do nothing."Oh, God, I am so unhappy!"He sprang up again and sang "The Tree's early leaf-buds" till the
mountains resounded.Then he sat down where she had been sitting, and took up the flowers
she had picked, but he flung them away again down the hill on every
side.It was long since he had done so; this struck
him, and made him weep still more.He would go far away, that he
would; no, he would not go away!He thought he was very unhappy; but
when he asked himself why, he could hardly tell.It
was a lovely day; and the Sabbath rest lay over all.The lake was
without a ripple; from the houses the curling smoke had begun to
rise; the partridges one after another had ceased calling, and though
the little birds continued their twittering, they went towards the
shade of the wood; the dewdrops were gone, and the grass looked
grave; not a breath of wind stirred the drooping leaves; and the sun
was near the meridian.Almost before he knew, he found himself seated
putting together a little song; a sweet tune offered itself for it;
and while his heart was strangely full of gentle feelings, the tune
went and came till words linked themselves to it and begged to be
sung, if only for once.He sang them gently, sitting where Eli had sat:

   "He went in the forest the whole day long,
    The whole day long;
    For there he had heard such a wondrous song,
    A wondrous song."He fashioned a flute from a willow spray,
    A willow spray,
    To see if within it the sweet tune lay,
    The sweet tune lay."It whispered and told him its name at last,
    Its name at last;
    But then, while he listened, away it passed,
    Away it passed."But oft when he slumbered, again it stole,
    Again it stole,
    With touches of love upon his soul,
    Upon his soul."Then he tried to catch it, and keep it fast,
    And keep it fast;
    But he woke, and away i' the night it passed,
    I' the night it passed."'My Lord, let me pass in the night, I pray,
    In the night, I pray;
    For the tune has taken my heart away,
    My heart away.'"Then answered the Lord, 'It is thy friend,
    It is thy friend,
    Though not for an hour shall thy longing end,
    Thy longing end;

   "'And all the others are nothing to thee,
    Nothing to thee,
    To this that thou seekest and never shalt see,
    Never shalt see.'"SOMEBODY'S FUTURE HOME."Good bye," said Margit at the Clergyman's door.It was a Sunday
evening in advancing summer-time; the Clergyman had returned from
church, and Margit had been sitting with him till now, when it was
seven o'clock."Good bye, Margit," said the Clergyman.She hurried
down the door-steps and into the yard; for she had seen Eli Boeen
playing there with her brother and the Clergyman's son."Good evening," said Margit, stopping; "and God bless you all."She blushed crimson and wanted to leave
off the game; the boys begged her to keep on, but she persuaded them
to let her go for that evening."I almost think I know you," said Margit.you're Eli Boeen; yes, now I see you're like your mother."Eli's auburn hair had come unfastened, and hung down over her neck
and shoulders; she was hot and as red as a cherry, her bosom
fluttered up and down, and she could scarcely speak, but laughed
because she was so out of breath."Well, young folks should be merry," said Margit, feeling happy as
she looked at her."P'r'aps you don't know me?"If Margit had not been her senior, Eli would probably have asked her
name, but now she only said she did not remember having seen her
before."No; I dare say not: old folks don't go out much.But my son, p'r'aps
you know a little--Arne Kampen; I'm his mother," said Margit, with a
stolen glance at Eli, who suddenly looked grave and breathed slowly."I'm pretty sure he worked at Boeen once.""It's a fine evening; we turned our hay this morning, and got it in
before I came away; it's good weather indeed for everything.""There will be a good hay-harvest this year," Eli suggested."Yes, you may well say that; everything's getting on well at Boeen, I
suppose?""Oh, yes, I dare say you have; your folks work well, and they have
plenty of help."Couldn't you go a little way with me?I so seldom have anybody to
talk to; and it will be all the same to you, I suppose?"Eli excused herself, saying she had not her jacket on."Well, it's a shame to ask such a thing the first time of seeing
anybody; but one must put up with old folks' ways."Eli said she would go; she would only fetch her jacket first.It was a close-fitting jacket, which when fastened looked like a
dress with a bodice; but now she fastened only two of the lower
hooks, because she was so hot.Her fine linen bodice had a little
turned-down collar, and was fastened with a silver stud in the shape
of a bird with spread wings.Just such a one, Nils, the tailor, wore
the first time Margit danced with him."A pretty stud," she said, looking at it."Ah, I thought so," Margit said, helping her with the jacket.The hay was lying in heaps; and
Margit took up a handful, smelled it, and thought it was very good.She asked about the cattle at the parsonage, and this led her to ask
also about the live stock at Boeen, and then she told how much they
had at Kampen."The farm has improved very much these last few years,
and it can still be made twice as large.He keeps twelve milch-cows
now, and he could keep several more, but he reads so many books and
manages according to them, and so he will have the cows fed in such a
first-rate way."Eli, as might be expected, said nothing to all this; and Margit then
asked her age."Have you helped in the house-work?Not much, I dare say--you look so
spruce."Yes, she had helped a good deal, especially of late."Well, it's best to use one's self to do a little of everything; when
one gets a large house of one's own, there's a great deal to be done.But, of course, when one finds good help already in the house before
her, why, it doesn't matter so much."Now Eli thought she must go back; for they had gone a long way beyond
the grounds of the parsonage."It still wants some hours to sunset; it would be kind it you would
chat a little longer with me."Then Margit began to talk about Arne."I don't know if you know much
of him.He could teach you something about everything, he could; dear
me, what a deal he has read!"Eli owned she knew he had read a great deal."Yes; and that's only the least thing that can be said of him; but
the way he has behaved to his mother all his days, that's something
more, that is.If the old saying is true, that he who's good to his
mother is good to his wife, the one Arne chooses won't have much to
complain of."Eli asked why they had painted the house before them with grey paint."Ah, I suppose they had no other; I only wish Arne may sometime be
rewarded for all his kindness to his mother.When he has a wife, she
ought to be kind-hearted as well as a good scholar."I only dropped a little twig I had."I think of a many things, you may be sure, while I sit
alone in yonder wood.If ever he takes home a wife who brings
blessings to house and man, then I know many a poor soul will be glad
that day."They were both silent, and walked on without looking at each other;
but soon Eli stopped."One of my shoe-strings has come down."Margit waited a long while till at last the string was tied."He has such queer ways," she began again; "he got cowed while he was
a child, and so he has got into the way of thinking over everything
by himself, and those sort of folks haven't courage to come forward."Now Eli must indeed go back, but Margit said that
Kampen was only half a mile off; indeed, not so far, and that Eli
must see it, as too she was so near.But Eli thought it would be late
that day."There'll be sure to be somebody to bring you home.""No, no," Eli answered quickly, and would go back."Arne's not at home, it's true," said Margit; "but there's sure to be
somebody else about;" and Eli had now less objection to it."If only I shall not be too late," she said."Yes, if we stand here much longer talking about it, it may be too
late, I dare say.""Being brought up at the
Clergyman's, you've read a great deal, I dare say?""It'll be of good use when you have a husband who knows less."No; that, Eli thought she would never have."Well, no; p'r'aps, after all, it isn't the best thing; but still
folks about here haven't much learning."Eli asked if it was Kampen, she could see straight before her."No; that's Gransetren, the next place to the wood; when we come
farther up you'll see Kampen.It's a pleasant place to live at, is
Kampen, you may be sure; it seems a little out of the way, it's true;
but that doesn't matter much, after all."Eli asked what made the smoke that rose from the wood."It comes from a houseman's cottage, belonging to Kampen: a man named
Opplands-Knut lives there.He went about lonely till Arne gave him
that piece of land to clear.he knows what it is to be
lonely."Soon they came far enough to see Kampen."Yes, it is," said the mother; and she, too, stood still.The sun
shone full in their faces, and they shaded their eyes as they looked
down over the plain.In the middle of it stood the red-painted house
with its white window-frames; rich green cornfields lay between the
pale new-mown meadows, where some of the hay was already set in
stacks; near the cow-house, all was life and stir; the cows, sheep
and goats were coming home; their bells tinkled, the dogs barked, and
the milkmaids called; while high above all, rose the grand tune of
the waterfall from the ravine.The farther Eli went, the more this
filled her ears, till at last it seemed quite awful to her; it
whizzed and roared through her head, her heart throbbed violently,
and she became bewildered and dizzy, and then felt so subdued that
she unconsciously began to walk with such small timid steps that
Margit begged her to come on a little faster."I never
heard anything like that fall," she said; "I'm quite frightened.""You'll soon get used to it; and at last you'll even miss it.""Come, now, we'll first look at the cattle," she said, turning
downwards from the road, into the path."Those trees on each side,
Nils planted; he wanted to have everything nice, did Nils; and so
does Arne; look, there's the garden he has laid out."exclaimed Eli, going quickly towards the garden
fence."We'll look at that by-and-by," said Margit; "now we must go over to
look at the creatures before they're locked in--" But Eli did not
hear, for all her mind was turned to the garden.She stood looking
at it till Margit called her once more; as she came along, she gave a
furtive glance through the windows; but she could see no one inside.They both went upon the barn steps and looked down at the cows, as
they passed lowing into the cattle-house.Margit named them one by
one to Eli, and told her how much milk each gave, and which would
calve in the summer, and which would not.The sheep were counted and
penned in; they were of a large foreign breed, raised from two lambs
which Arne had got from the South."He aims at all such things," said
Margit, "though one wouldn't think it of him."Then they went into
the barn, and looked at some hay which had been brought in, and Eli
had to smell it; "for such hay isn't to be found everywhere," Margit
said.She pointed from the barn-hatch to the fields, and told what
kind of seed was sown on them, and how much of each kind."No less
than three fields are new-cleared, and now, this first year, they're
set with potatoes, just for the sake of the ground; over there, too,
the land's new-cleared, but I suppose that soil's different, for
there he has sown barley; but then he has strewed burnt turf over it
for manure, for he attends to all such things.Well, she that comes
here will find things in good order, I'm sure."Now they went out
towards the dwelling-house; and Eli, who had answered nothing to all
that Margit had told her about other things, when they passed the
garden asked if she might go into it; and when she got leave to go,
she begged to pick a flower or two.Away in one corner was a little
garden-seat; she went over and sat down upon it--perhaps only to try
it, for she rose directly."Now we must make haste, else we shall be too late," said Margit, as
she stood at the house-door.Margit asked if Eli
would not take some refreshment, as this was the first time she had
been at Kampen; but Eli turned red and quickly refused.Then they
looked round the room, which was the one Arne and the mother
generally used in the day-time; it was not very large, but cosy and
pleasant, with windows looking out on the road.There were a clock
and a stove; and on the wall hung Nils' fiddle, old and dark, but
with new strings; beside it hung some guns belonging to Arne, English
fishing-tackle and other rare things, which the mother took down and
showed to Eli, who looked at them and touched them.The room was
without painting, for this Arne did not like; neither was there any
in the large pretty room which looked towards the ravine, with the
green mountains on the other side, and the blue peaks in the
background.But the two smaller rooms in the wing were both painted;
for in them the mother would live when she became old, and Arne
brought a wife into the house: Margit was very fond of painting, and
so in these rooms the ceilings were painted with roses, and her name
was painted on the cupboards, the bedsteads, and on all reasonable
and unreasonable places; for it was Arne himself who had done it.They went into the kitchen, the store-room, and the bake-house; and
now they had only to go into the up-stairs rooms; "all the best
things were there," the mother said.These were comfortable rooms, corresponding with those below, but
they were new and not yet taken into use, save one which looked
towards the ravine.In them hung and stood all sorts of household
things not in every-day use.Here hung a lot of fur coverlets and
other bedclothes; and the mother took hold of them and lifted them;
so did Eli, who looked at all of them with pleasure, examined some of
them twice, and asked questions about them, growing all the while
more interested."Now we'll find the key of Arne's room," said the mother, taking it
from under a chest where it was hidden.They went into the room; it
looked towards the ravine; and once more the awful booming of the
waterfall met their ears, for the window was open.They could see the
spray rising between the cliffs, but not the fall itself, save in one
place farther up, where a huge fragment of rock had fallen into it
just where the torrent came in full force to take its last leap into
the depths below.The upper side of this fragment was covered with
fresh sod; and a few pine-cones had dug themselves into it, and had
grown up to trees, rooted into the crevices.The wind had shaken and
twisted them; and the fall had dashed against them, so that they had
not a sprig lower than eight feet from their roots: they were gnarled
and bent; yet they stood, rising high between the rocky walls.When
Eli looked out from the window, these trees first caught her eye;
next, she saw the snowy peaks rising far beyond behind the green
mountains.Then her eyes passed over the quiet fertile fields back to
the room; and the first thing she saw there was a large bookshelf.There were so many books on it that she scarcely believed the
Clergyman had more.Beneath it was a cupboard, where Arne kept his
money.The mother said money had been left to them twice already, and
if everything went right they would have some more."But, after all,
money's not the best thing in the world; he may get what's better
still," she added.There were many little things in the cupboard which were amusing to
see, and Eli looked at them all, happy as a child.Then the mother
showed her a large chest where Arne's clothes lay, and they, too,
were taken out and looked at."I've never seen you till to-day, and yet I'm already so fond of you,
my child," she said, looking affectionately into her eyes.Eli had
scarcely time to feel a little bashful, before Margit pulled her by
the hand and said in a low voice, "Look at that little red chest;
there's something very choice in that, you may be sure."Eli glanced towards the chest: it was a little square one, which she
thought she would very much like to have."He doesn't want me to know what's in that chest," the mother
whispered; "and he always hides the key."She went to some clothes
that hung on the wall, took down a velvet waistcoat, looked in the
pocket, and there found the key."Now come and look," she whispered; and they went gently, and knelt
down before the chest.As soon as the mother opened it, so sweet an
odor met them that Eli clapped her hands even before she had seen
anything.On the top was spread a handkerchief, which the mother
took away."Here, look," she whispered, taking out a fine black
silk neckerchief such as men do not wear."It looks just as if it
was meant for a girl," the mother said.Eli spread it upon her lap
and looked at it, but did not say a word."Here's one more," the
mother said.Eli could not help taking it up; and then the mother
insisted upon trying it on her, though Eli drew back and held her
head down.She did not know what she would not have given for such a
neckerchief; but she thought of something more than that.They
folded them up again, but slowly."Now, look here," the mother said, taking out some handsome ribands."Everything seems as if it was for a girl."Eli blushed crimson, but
she said nothing."There's some more things yet," said the mother,
taking out some fine black cloth for a dress; "it's fine, I dare
say," she added, holding it up to the light.Eli's hands trembled,
her chest heaved, she felt the blood rushing to her head, and she
would fain have turned away, but that she could not well do."He has bought something every time he has been to town," continued
the mother.Eli could scarcely bear it any longer; she looked from
one thing to another in the chest, and then again at the cloth, and
her face burned.The next thing the mother took out was wrapped in
paper; they unwrapped it, and found a small pair of shoes.Anything
like them, they had never seen, and the mother wondered how they
could be made.Eli said nothing; but when she touched the shoes her
fingers left warm marks on them."I'm hot, I think," she whispered."Doesn't it seem just as if he had bought them all, one after
another, for somebody he was afraid to give them to?""He has kept them here in this chest--so long."She
laid them all in the chest again, just as they were before."Now
we'll see what's here in the compartment," she said, opening the lid
carefully, as if she were now going to show Eli something specially
beautiful.When Eli looked she saw first a broad buckle for a waistband, next,
two gold rings tied together, and a hymn-book bound in velvet and
with silver clasps; but then she saw nothing more, for on the silver
of the book she had seen graven in small letters, "Eli Baardsdatter
Boeen."The mother wished her to look at something else; she got no answer,
but saw tear after tear dropping down upon the silk neckerchief and
spreading over it.She put down the _sylgje_[5] which she had in her
hand, shut the lid, turned round and drew Eli to her.Then the
daughter wept upon her breast, and the mother wept over her, without
either of them saying any more.[5] _Sylgje_, a peculiar kind of brooch worn in Norway.--Translators.*       *       *       *       *

A little while after, Eli walked by herself in the garden, while the
mother was in the kitchen preparing something nice for supper; for
now Arne would soon be at home.Then she came out in the garden to
Eli, who sat tracing names on the sand with a stick.When she saw
Margit, she smoothed the sand down over them, looked up and smiled;
but she had been weeping."There's nothing to cry about, my child," said Margit, caressing her;
"supper's ready now; and here comes Arne," she added, as a black
figure appeared on the road between the shrubs.Eli stole in, and the mother followed her.The supper-table was
nicely spread with dried meat, cakes and cream porridge; Eli did not
look at it, however, but went away to a corner near the clock and sat
down on a chair close to the wall, trembling at every sound.Firm steps were heard on the flagstones,
and a short, light step in the passage, the door was gently opened,
and Arne came in.The first thing he saw was Eli in the corner; he left hold on the
door and stood still.This made Eli feel yet more confused; she rose,
but then felt sorry she had done so, and turned aside towards the
wall.She held her hand before her face, as one does when the sun shines
into the eyes.She put her hand down again, and turned a little towards him, but
then bent her head and burst into tears.She did not answer,
but wept still more.She leant
her head upon his breast, and he whispered something down to her; she
did not answer, but clasped her hands round his neck.They stood thus for a long while; and not a sound was heard, save
that of the fall which still gave its eternal warning, though distant
and subdued.Then some one over against the table was heard weeping;
Arne looked up: it was the mother; but he had not noticed her till
then."Now, I'm sure you won't go away from me, Arne," she said,
coming across the floor to him; and she wept much, but it did her
good, she said.*       *       *       *       *

Later, when they had supped and said good-bye to the mother, Eli and
Arne walked together along the road to the parsonage.It was one of
those light summer nights when all things seem to whisper and crowd
together, as if in fear.Even he who has from childhood been
accustomed to such nights, feels strangely influenced by them, and
goes about as if expecting something to happen: light is there, but
not life.Often the sky is tinged with blood-red, and looks out
between the pale clouds like an eye that has watched.One seems to
hear a whispering all around, but it comes only from one's own brain,
which is over-excited.Man shrinks, feels his own littleness, and
thinks of his God.Those two who were walking here also kept close to each other; they
felt as if they had too much happiness, and they feared it might be
taken from them."I can hardly believe it," Arne said."I feel almost the same," said Eli, looking dreamily before her."_Yet it's true_," he said, laying stress on each word; "now I am no
longer going about only thinking; for once I have done something."He paused a few moments, and then laughed, but not gladly."No, it
was not I," he said; "it was mother who did it."He seemed to have continued this thought, for after a while he said,
"Up to this day I have done nothing; not taken my part in anything.He went on a little farther, and then said warmly, "God be thanked
that I have got through in this way;... now people will not have to
see many things which would not have been as they ought...." Then
after a while he added, "But if some one had not helped me, perhaps I
should have gone on alone for ever.""What do you think father will say, dear?"asked Eli, who had been
busy with her own thoughts."I am going over to Boeen early to-morrow morning," said
Arne;--"_that_, at any rate, I must do myself," he added, determining
he would now be cheerful and brave, and never think of sad things
again; no, never!"And, Eli, it was you who found my song in the
nut-wood?""And the tune I had made it for, you got hold
of, too.""I took the one which suited it," she said, looking down.He smiled
joyfully and bent his face down to hers."But the other song you did not know?"she asked looking up....

"Eli... you mustn't be angry with me... but one day this spring...
yes, I couldn't help it, I heard you singing on the parsonage-hill."She blushed and looked down, but then she laughed."Then, after all,
you have been served just right," she said."Well--it was; nay, it wasn't my fault; it was your mother... well
... another time...."

"Nay; tell it me now."She would not;--then he stopped and exclaimed, "Surely, you haven't
been up-stairs?"He was so grave that she felt frightened, and looked
down."Mother has perhaps found the key to that little chest?"She hesitated, looked up and smiled, but it seemed as if only to keep
back her tears; then he laid his arm round her neck and drew her
still closer to him.He trembled, lights seemed flickering before his
eyes, his head burned, he bent over her and his lips sought hers, but
could hardly find them; he staggered, withdrew his arm, and turned
aside, afraid to look at her.The clouds had taken such strange
shapes; there was one straight before him which looked like a goat
with two great horns, and standing on its hind legs; and there was
the nose of an old woman with her hair tangled; and there was the
picture of a big man, which was set slantwise, and then was suddenly
rent.... But just over the mountain the sky was blue and clear; the
cliff stood gloomy, while the lake lay quietly beneath it, afraid to
move; pale and misty it lay, forsaken both by sun and moon, but the
wood went down to it, full of love just as before.Some birds woke
and twittered half in sleep; answers came over from one copse and
then from another, but there was no danger at hand, and they slept
once more... there was peace all around.Arne felt its blessedness
lying over him as it lay over the evening.he said, so that he heard the words
himself, and he folded his hands, but went a little before Eli that
she might not see it.It was in the end of harvest-time, and the corn was being carried.It
was a bright day; there had been rain in the night and earlier in
morning, but now the air was clear and mild as in summer-time.It was
Saturday; yet many boats were steering over the Swart-water towards
the church; the men, in their white shirt-sleeves, sat rowing, while
the women, with light- kerchiefs on their heads, sat in the
stern and the forepart.But still more boats were steering towards
Boeen, in readiness to go out thence in procession; for to-day Baard
Boeen kept the wedding of his daughter, Eli, and Arne Nilsson Kampen.The doors were all open, people went in and out, children with pieces
of cake in their hands stood in the yard, fidgety about their new
clothes, and looking distantly at each other; an old woman sat lonely
and weeping on the steps of the storehouse: it was Margit Kampen.She
wore a large silver ring, with several small rings fastened to the
upper plate; and now and then she looked at it: Nils gave it her on
their wedding-day, and she had never worn it since.The purveyor of the feast and the two young brides-men--the
Clergyman's son and Eli's brother--went about in the rooms offering
refreshments to the wedding-guests as they arrived.Up-stairs in
Eli's room, were the Clergyman's lady, the bride and Mathilde, who
had come from town only to put on her bridal-dress and ornaments,
for this they had promised each other from childhood.Arne was
dressed in a fine cloth suit, round jacket, black hat, and a collar
that Eli had made; and he was in one of the down-stairs rooms,
standing at the window where she wrote "Arne."It was open, and he
leant upon the sill, looking away over the calm water towards the
distant bight and the church.Outside in the passage, two met as they came from doing their part in
the day's duties.The one came from the stepping-stones on the shore,
where he had been arranging the church-boats; he wore a round black
jacket of fine cloth, and blue frieze trousers, off which the dye
came, making his hands blue; his white collar looked well against his
fair face and long light hair; his high forehead was calm, and a
quiet smile lay round his lips.She whom he met had
just come from the kitchen, dressed ready to go to church.She was
tall and upright, and came through the door somewhat hurriedly, but
with a firm step; when she met Baard she stopped, and her mouth drew
to one side.Each had something to say to
the other, but neither could find words for it.Baard was even more
embarrassed than she; he smiled more and more, and at last turned
towards the staircase, saying as he began to step up, "Perhaps you'll
come too."Here, up-stairs, was no one but
themselves; yet Baard locked the door after them, and he was a long
while about it.When at last he turned round, Birgit stood looking
out from the window, perhaps to avoid looking in the room.Baard took
from his breast-pocket a little silver cup, and a little bottle of
wine, and poured out some for her.But she would not take any, though
he told her it was wine the Clergyman had sent them.Then he drank
some himself, but offered it to her several times while he was
drinking.He corked the bottle, put it again into his pocket with the
cup, and sat down on a chest.He breathed deeply several times, looked down and said, "I'm so
happy-to-day; and I thought I must speak freely with you; it's a long
while since I did so."Birgit stood leaning with one hand upon the window-sill.Baard went
on, "I've been thinking about Nils, the tailor, to-day; he separated
us two; I thought it wouldn't go beyond our wedding, but it has gone
farther.To-day, a son of his, well-taught and handsome, is taken
into our family, and we have given him our only daughter.What now,
if we, Birgit, were to keep our wedding once again, and keep it so
that we can never more be separated?"His voice trembled, and he gave a little cough.Birgit laid her head
down upon her arm, but said nothing.Baard waited long, but he got no
answer, and he had himself nothing more to say.He looked up and grew
very pale, for she did not even turn her head.At the same moment came a gentle knock at the door, and a soft voice
asked, "Are you coming now, mother?"Birgit raised her
head, and, looking towards the door, she saw Baard's pale face."Yes, now I am coming," said Birgit in a broken voice, while she gave
her hand to Baard, and burst into a violent flood of tears.The two hands pressed each other; they were both toilworn now, but
they clasped as firmly as if they had sought each other for twenty
years.They were still locked together, when Baard and Birgit went to
the door; and afterwards when the bridal train went down to the
stepping-stones on the shore, and Arne gave his hand to Eli, Baard
looked at them, and, against all custom, took Birgit by the hand and
followed them with a bright smile.But Margit Kampen went behind them lonely.Baard was quite overjoyed that day.While he was talking with the
rowers, one of them, who sat looking at the mountains behind, said
how strange it was that even such a steep cliff could be clad."Ah,
whether it wishes to be, or not, it must," said Baard, looking all
along the train till his eyes rested on the bridal pair and his wife."Who could have foretold this twenty years ago?"Cambridge: Stereotyped and Printed by John Wilson & Son.THE
CHILDREN'S GARLAND

FROM THE BEST POETS

SELECTED AND ARRANGED
BY COVENTRY PATMORE

16mo."It includes specimens of all the great masters in the art of Poetry,
selected with the matured judgment of a man concentrated on obtaining
insight into the feelings and tastes of childhood, and desirous to
awaken its finest impulses, to cultivate its keenest sensibilities."CINCINNATI GAZETTE."The University Press at Cambridge has turned out many wonderful
specimens of the art, but in exquisite finish it has never equalled
the evidence of its skill which now lies before us.The text,
compared with the average specimens of modern books, shines out with
as bright a contrast as an Elzevir by the side of one of its dingy
and bleared contemporaries.In the quality of its paper, in its
vignettes and head-pieces, the size of its pages, in every feature
that can gratify the eye, indeed, the 'Garland' could hardly bear
improvement.Similar in its general getting up to the much-admired
Golden Treasury of English Songs and Lyrics, issued by the same
publishers a few months since, it excels, we think, in the perfection
of various minor details.""It is a beautiful book,--the most beautiful in some respects that
has been published for years; going over a large number of poets and
wide range of themes as none but a poet could have done.A choice
cabinet of precious jewels, or better still, a dainty wreath of
blossoms,--'The Children's Garland.'""It is in all respects a delicious volume, and will be as great a
favorite with the elder as with the younger members of every family
into which it penetrates.Some of the best poems in the English
language are included in the selections.Paper, printing, and
binding,--indeed, all the elements entering into the mechanical
execution of the book,--offer to the view nothing wherein the most
fastidious eye can detect a blemish.""It is almost too dainty a book to be touched, and yet it is sure to
be well thumbed whenever it falls into the hands of a lover of
genuine poetry."THE
JEST-BOOK

THE CHOICEST ANECDOTES AND SAYINGS

SELECTED AND ARRANGED
BY MARK LEMON

16mo.Here is an interest for a minute or a
dull day.Mark Lemon gives us the result of his recondite searches
and seizures in the regions of infinite jest.Like all good jesters,
he has the quality of sound philosophy in him, and of reason also,
for he discriminates closely, and serves up his wit with a deal of
refinement in it.""So exquisitely is the book printed, that every jest in it shines
like a new gold dollar.It is the apotheosis of jokes.... There is
jollity enough in it to keep the whole American press good humored.""Mark Lemon, who helps to flavor Punch, has gathered this volume of
anecdotes, this parcel of sharp and witty sayings, and we have no
fear in declaring that the reader will find it a book of some wisdom
and much amusement.By this single 'Lemon' we judge of the rest.""This little volume is a very agreeable provocative of mirth, and as
such, it will be useful in driving dull care away.""It contains many old jokes, which like good wine become all the
better for age, and many new and fugitive ones which until now never
had a local habitation and a name.""For a fireside we can imagine nothing more diverting or more likely
to be laughed over during the intervals of labor or study."The weight is held entirely upon this foot during the
remainder of the measure, whether it be in 3/4 or 2/4 time.The following preparatory exercises must be practiced forward and
backward until the movements become natural, before proceeding.In going backward, the foot must be carried to the rear as far as
possible, and the weight must always be perpendicular to the supporting
foot.These movements are identical with walking, and except the particular
care which must be bestowed upon the placing of the foot on the first
count of the measure, they require no special degree of attention.On the second count the free leg swings forward until the knee has
become entirely straightened, and is held, suspended, during the third
count of the measure.This should be practiced, first with the weight
resting upon the entire sole of the supporting foot, and then, when this
has been perfectly accomplished, the same exercise may be supplemented
by raising the heel (of the supporting foot) on the second count and
lowering it on the third count._Great care must be taken not to divide
the weight._

For the purpose of instruction, it is well to practice these steps to
Mazurka music, because of the clearness of the count.[Illustration]

When the foregoing exercises have been so fully mastered as to become,
in a sense, muscular habits, we may, with safety, add the next feature.This consists in touching the floor with the point of the free foot, at
a point as far forward or backward as can be done without dividing the
weight, on the second count of the measure.Thus, we have accomplished,
as it were, an interrupted, or, at least, an arrested step, and this is
the true essence of the Boston.Too great care cannot be expended upon this phase of the step, and it
must be practiced over and over again, both forward and backward, until
the movement has become second nature.All this must precede any attempt
to turn.The turning of the Boston is simplicity itself, but it is, nevertheless,
the one point in the instruction which is most bothersome to
learners.The turn is executed upon the ball of _the supporting foot_,
and consists in twisting half round without lifting either foot from the
ground.In this, the weight is held altogether upon the supporting foot,
and there is no crossing.In carrying the foot forward for the second movement, the knees must
pass close to one another, and care must be taken that _the entire half
turn comes upon the last count of the measure_.To sum up:--

Starting with the weight upon the left foot, step forward, placing the
entire weight upon the right foot, as in the illustration facing page 14
(count 1); swing left leg quickly forward, straightening the left knee
and raising the right heel, and touch the floor with the extended left
foot as in the illustration facing page 16, but without placing any
weight upon that foot (count 2); execute a half-turn to the left,
backward, upon the ball of the supporting (right) foot, at the same time
lowering the right heel, and finish as in the illustration opposite page
18 (count 3).[Illustration]

Starting again, this time with the weight wholly upon the right foot,
and with the left leg extended backward, and the point of the left foot
lightly touching the floor, step backward, throwing the weight entirely
upon the left foot which sinks to a position flat upon the floor, as
shown in the illustration facing page 21, (count 4); carry the right
foot quickly backward, and touch with the point as far back as possible
upon the line of direction without dividing the weight, at the same time
raising the left heel as in the illustration facing page 22, (count 5);
and complete the rotation by executing a half-turn to the right,
forward, upon the ball of the left foot, simultaneously lowering the
left heel, and finishing as in the illustration facing page 24, (count
6).THE REVERSE

The reverse of the step should be acquired at the same time as the
rotation to the right, and it is, therefore, of great importance to
alternate from the right to the left rotation from the beginning of the
turning exercise.The reverse itself, that is to say, the act of
alternating is effected in a single measure without turning (see
preparatory exercise, page 13) which may be taken backward by the
gentleman and forward by the lady, whenever they have completed a whole
turn.The mechanism of the reverse turn is exactly the same as that of the
turn to the right, except that it is accomplished with the other foot,
and in the opposite direction.There is no better or more efficacious exercise to perfect the Boston,
than that which is made up of one complete turn to the right, a measure
to reverse, and a complete turn to the left.This should be practised
until one has entirely mastered the motion and rhythm of the dance.The
writer has used this exercise in all his work, and finds it not only
helpful and interesting to the pupil, but of special advantage in
obviating the possibility of dizziness, and the consequent
unpleasantness and loss of time.[Illustration]

After acquiring a degree of ease in the execution of these movements to
Mazurka music, it is advisable to vary the rhythm by the introduction of
Spanish or other clearly accented Waltz music, before using the more
liquid compositions of Strauss or such modern song waltzes as those of
Danglas, Sinibaldi, etc.It is one of the remarkable features of the Boston that the weight is
always opposite the line of direction--that is to say, in going forward,
the weight is retained upon the rear foot, and in going backward, the
weight is always upon the front foot (direction always radiates from the
dancer).Thus, in proceeding around the room, the weight must always be
held back, instead of inclining slightly forward as in the other round
dances.This seeming contradiction of forces lends to the Boston a
unique charm which is to be found in no other dance.As the dancer becomes more familiar with the Boston, the movement
becomes so natural that little or no thought need be paid to technique,
in order to develop the peculiar grace of it.The fact of its being a dance altogether in one position calls for
greater skill in the execution of the Boston, than would be the case if
there were other changes and contrasts possible, just as it is more
difficult to play a melody upon a violin of only one string.The Boston, in its completed form, resolves itself into a sort of
walking movement, so natural and easy that it may be enjoyed for a
whole evening without more fatigue than would be the result of a single
hour of the Waltz and Two-Step.Aside from the attractiveness of the Boston as a social dance, its
physical benefits are more positive than those of any other Round Dance
that we have ever had.The action is so adjusted as to provide the
maximum of muscular exercise and the minimum of physical effort.This
tends towards the conservation of energy, and produces and maintains, at
the same time an evenness of blood pressure and circulation.The
movements also necessitate a constant exercise of the ankles and insteps
which is very strengthening to those parts, and cannot fail to raise and
support the arch of the foot.Taken from any standpoint, the Boston is one of the most worthy forms of
the social dance ever devised, and the distortions of position which
are now occasionally practiced must soon give way to the genuinely
refining influence of the action.[Illustration]

Of the various forms of the Boston, there is little to be said beyond
the description of the manner of their execution, which will be treated
in the following pages.It is hoped that this book will help toward a more complete
understanding of the beauties and attractions of the Boston, and further
the proper appreciation of it._All descriptions of dances given in this book relate to the lady's
part.The gentleman's is exactly the same, but in the countermotion._


THE LONG BOSTON

The ordinary form of the Boston as described in the foregoing pages is
commonly known as the "Long" Boston to distinguish it from other forms
and variations.It is danced in 3/4 time, either Waltz or Mazurka, and
at any tempo desired.As this is the fundamental form of the Boston, it
should be thoroughly acquired before undertaking any other.[Illustration]


THE SHORT BOSTON

The "Short" Boston differs from the "Long" Boston only in measure.It is
danced in either 2/4 or 6/8 time, and the first movement (in 2/4 time)
occupies the duration of a quarter-note.The second and third movements
each occupy the duration of an eighth-note.Thus, there exists between
the "Long" and the "Short" Boston the same difference as between the
Waltz and the Galop.In the more rapid forms of the "Short" Boston, the
rising and sinking upon the second and third movements naturally take
the form of a hop or skip.The dance is more enjoyable and less
fatiguing in moderate tempo.THE OPEN BOSTON

The "Open" Boston contains two parts of eight measures each.The first
part is danced in the positions shown in the illustrations facing pages
8 and 10, and the second part consists of 8 measures of the "Long"
Boston.In the first part, the dancers execute three Boston steps forward,
without turning, and one Boston step turning (towards the partner) to
face directly backward (1/2 turn).This is followed by three Boston steps backward (without turning) in the
position shown in the illustration facing page 10, followed by one
Boston step turning (toward the partner) and finishing in regular Waltz
Position for the execution of the second part.[Illustration]


THE BOSTON DIP

The "Dip" is a combination dance in 3/4 or 3/8 time, and contains 4
measures of the "Long" Boston, preceded by 4 measures, as follows:

Standing upon the left foot, step directly to the side, and transfer the
weight to the right foot (count 1); swing the left leg to the right in
front of the right, at the same time raising the right heel (count 2);
lower the right heel (count 3); return the left foot to its original
place where it receives the weight (count 4); swing the right leg across
in front of the left, raising the left heel (count 5); and lower the
left heel (count 6).Swing the right foot to the right, and put it down directly at the side
of the left (count 1); hop on the right foot and swing the left across
in front (count 2); fall back upon the right foot (count 3); put down
the left foot, crossing in front of the right, and transfer weight to it
(count 4); with right foot step a whole step to the right (count 5); and
finish by bringing the left foot against the right, where it receives
the weight (count 6).In executing the hop upon counts 2 and 3 of the third measure, the
movement must be so far delayed that the falling back will exactly
coincide with the third count of the music.[Illustration]




THE TURKEY TROT

_Preparation:--Side Position of the Waltz._


During the first four measures take four Boston steps without turning
(lady forward, gentleman backward), and bending the supporting knee,
stretch the free foot backward, (lady's left, gentleman's right) as
shown in the illustration opposite.Execute four drawing steps to the side (lady's right, gentleman's left)
swaying the shoulders and body in the direction of the drawn foot, and
pointing with the free foot upon the fourth, as shown in figure.Eight whole turns, Short Boston or Two-Step.*       *       *       *       *

  A splendid specimen for this dance will be found in "The Gobbler" by
  J. Monroe.THE AEROPLANE GLIDE


The "Aeroplane Glide" is very similar to the Boston Dip.It is supposed
to represent the start of the flight of an aeroplane, and derives its
name from that fact.The sole difference between the "Dip" and "Aeroplane" consists in the
six running steps which make up the first two measures.Of these running
steps, which are executed sidewise and with alternate crossings, before
and behind, only the fourth, at the beginning of the second measure
requires special description.Upon this step, the supporting knee is
noticeably bended to coincide with the accent of the music.The rest of the dance is identical with the "Dip".[Illustration]




THE TANGO


The Tango is a Spanish American dance which contains much of the
peculiar charm of the other Spanish dances, and its execution depends
largely upon the ability of the dancers so to grasp the rhythm of the
music as to interpret it by their movements.The steps are all simple,
and the dancers are permitted to vary or improvise the figures at will.Of these figures the two which follow are most common, and lend
themselves most readily to verbal description.1

The partners face one another as in Waltz Position.The gentleman takes
the lady's right hand in his left, and, stretching the arms to the full
extent, holding them at the shoulder height, he places her right hand
upon his left shoulder, and holds it there, as in the illustration
opposite page 30.In starting, the gentleman throws his right shoulder slightly back and
steps directly backward with his left foot, while the lady follows
forward with her right.In this manner both continue two steps, crossing
one foot over the other and then execute a half-turn in the same
direction.This is followed by four measures of the Two-Step and the
whole is repeated at will.[Illustration]


TANGO No.2

This variant starts from the same position as Tango No.The gentleman
takes two steps backward with the lady following forward, and then two
steps to the side (the lady's right and the gentleman's left) and two
steps in the opposite direction to the original position.These steps to the side should be marked by the swaying of the bodies as
the feet are drawn together on the second count of the measure, and the
whole is followed by 8 measures of the Two-Step.IDEAL MUSIC FOR THE "BOSTON"

    The eastern ridge of Benvenue,

    Farewell to lovely Loch Achray--
    Where shall he find, in foreign land,

        Nor ripple on the lake,
      Upon her eyry nods the erne,[348]

        The springing trout lies still,
      So darkly glooms yon thunder cloud,
      That swathes, as with a purple shroud,
        Benledi's distant hill.Is it the thunder's solemn sound
        That mutters deep and dread,
      Or echoes from the groaning ground
        The warrior's measured tread?Is it the lightning's quivering glance
        That on the thicket streams,
      Or do they flash on spear and lance
        The sun's retiring beams?I see the dagger crest of Mar,

      Where rise no rocks its pride to brave,
        High swelling, dark, and slow.The lake is pass'd, and now they gain
    A narrow and a broken plain,
    Before the Trosachs' rugged jaws;
    And here the horse and spearmen pause.While, to explore the dangerous glen,
    Dive through the pass the archer men.""At once there rose so wild a yell
    Within that dark and narrow dell,
    As all the fiends, from heaven that fell,
    Had peal'd the banner cry of hell!Forth from the pass in tumult driven,
      Like chaff before the wind of heaven,
        The archery appear;
      For life!their plight they ply--
      And shriek, and shout, and battle cry,
      And plaids and bonnets waving high,
      And broadswords flashing to the sky,
        Are maddening in the rear.Onward they drive, in dreadful race,
        Pursuers and pursued;
      Before that tide of flight and chase,
      How shall it keep its rooted place,
        The spearmen's twilight wood?--
      'Down, down,' cried Mar, 'your lances down!--
      Like reeds before the tempest's frown,
      That serried grove of lances brown
        At once lay level'd low;
      And closely shouldering side to side,
      The bristling ranks the onset bide.--
      'We'll quell the savage mountaineer,
        As their Tinchel[352] cows the game!They come as fleet as forest deer,
        We'll drive them back as tame.'"--

[352] A circle of sportsmen surrounding a large space, which was
gradually narrowed till the game it inclosed was brought within reach."Bearing before them, in their course,
    The relics of the archer force,
    Like wave with crest of sparkling foam,
    Right onward did Clan-Alpine come.Above the tide, each broadsword bright
      Was brandishing like beam of light,
        Each targe was dark below;
      And with the ocean's mighty swing,
      When heaving to the tempest's wing,
        They hurl'd them on the foe.I heard the lance's shivering crash,
    As when the whirlwind rends the ash;
    I heard the broadsword's deadly clang,
    As if an hundred anvils rang!But Moray wheel'd his rearward rank
    Of horsemen on Clan-Alpine's flank,
        --'My banner man, advance!I see,' he cried, 'their column shake.--
      Now, gallants!for your ladies' sake,
        Upon them with the lance!'--
      The horsemen dash'd among the rout,
        As deer break through the broom;
      Their steeds are stout, their swords are out,
        They soon make lightsome room.Clan-Alpine's best are backward borne--
        Where, where was Roderick then?One blast upon his bugle horn
        Were worth a thousand men.And refluent[353] through the pass of fear
        The battle's tide was pour'd;
      Vanish'd the Saxon's struggling spear,
        Vanish'd the mountain sword.As Bracklinn's chasm, so black and steep,
        Receives her roaring linn,
      As the dark caverns of the deep
        Suck the dark whirlpool in,
    So did the deep and darksome pass
    Devour the battle's mingled mass:
    None linger now upon the plain,
    Save those who ne'er shall fight again.""Now westward rolls the battle's din,
    That deep and doubling pass within.the work of fate
    Is bearing on: its issue wait,
    Where the rude Trosachs' dread defile
    Opens on Katrine's lake and isle.Gray Benvenue I soon repass'd,
    Loch Katrine lay beneath me cast.The sun is set;--the clouds are met,
          The lowering scowl of heaven
      An inky hue of livid blue
          To the deep lake has given;
    Strange gusts of wind from mountain glen
    Swept o'er the lake, then sunk agen.I heeded not the eddying surge,
    Mine eye but saw the Trosachs' gorge,
    Mine ear but heard that sullen sound,
    Which like an earthquake shook the ground,
    And spoke the stern and desperate strife
    That parts not but with parting life,
    Seeming, to minstrel ear, to toll
    The dirge of many a passing soul.Nearer it comes--the dim-wood glen
      The martial flood disgorged agen,
          But not in mingled tide;
      The plaided warriors of the North
      High on the mountain thunder forth
          And overhang its side;
      While by the lake below appears
      The dark'ning cloud of Saxon spears.At weary bay each shatter'd band,
      Eying their foemen, sternly stand;
      Their banners stream like tatter'd sail,
      That flings its fragments to the gale,
      And broken arms and disarray
      Mark'd the fell havoc of the day.""Viewing the mountain's ridge askance,
    The Saxon stood in sullen trance,
    Till Moray pointed with his lance,
        And cried--'Behold yon isle!--
    See!none are left to guard its strand,
    But women weak, that wring the hand:
    'Tis there of yore the robber band
        Their booty wont to pile;--
    My purse, with bonnet pieces[354] store,
    To him will swim a bowshot o'er,
    And loose a shallop from the shore.Lightly we'll tame the war wolf then,
    Lords of his mate, and brood, and den.'--
    Forth from the ranks a spearman sprung,
    On earth his casque and corselet rung,
        He plunged him in the wave:--
    All saw the deed--the purpose knew,
    And to their clamors Benvenue
        A mingled echo gave;
    The Saxons shout, their mate to cheer,
    The helpless females scream for fear,
    And yells for rage the mountaineer.'Twas then, as by the outcry riven,
    Pour'd down at once the lowering heaven;
    A whirlwind swept Loch Katrine's breast,
    Her billows rear'd their snowy crest.Well for the swimmer swell'd they high,
    To mar the Highland marksman's eye;
    For round him shower'd,'mid rain and hail,
    The vengeful arrows of the Gael.--
    In vain--He nears the isle--and lo!His hand is on a shallop's bow.--Just then a flash of lightning came,
    It tinged the waves and strand with flame;--
    I mark'd Duncraggan's widow'd dame--
    Behind an oak I saw her stand,
    A naked dirk gleam'd in her hand:
    It darken'd,--but, amid the moan
    Of waves, I heard a dying groan;
    Another flash!--the spearman floats
    A weltering corse beside the boats,
    And the stern matron o'er him stood,
    Her hand and dagger streaming blood."[354] A bonnet piece is an elegant gold coin, bearing on one side the
head of James V. wearing a bonnet.the Saxons cried--
    The Gael's exulting shout replied.Despite the elemental rage,
    Again they hurried to engage;
    But, ere they closed in desperate fight,
    Bloody with spurring came a knight,
    Sprung from his horse, and, from a crag,
    Waved 'twixt the hosts a milk-white flag.Clarion and trumpet by his side
    Rung forth a truce note high and wide,
    While, in the Monarch's name, afar
    An herald's voice forbade the war,
    For Bothwell's lord, and Roderick bold,
    Were both, he said, in captive hold."--But here the lay made sudden stand,
    The harp escaped the Minstrel's hand!--
    Oft had he stolen a glance, to spy
    How Roderick brook'd his minstrelsy:
    At first, the Chieftain, to the chime,
    With lifted hand, kept feeble time;
    That motion ceased,--yet feeling strong
    Varied his look as changed the song;
    At length, no more his deafen'd ear
    The minstrel melody can hear;
    His face grows sharp,--his hands are clench'd,
    As if some pang his heartstrings wrench'd;
    Set are his teeth, his fading eye
    Is sternly fix'd on vacancy;
    Thus, motionless, and moanless, drew
    His parting breath, stout Roderick Dhu!--
    Old Allan-Bane look'd on aghast,
    While grim and still his spirit pass'd:
    But when he saw that life was fled,
    He pour'd his wailing o'er the dead."And art them cold and lowly laid,
    Thy foeman's dread, thy people's aid,
    Breadalbane's[355] boast, Clan-Alpine's shade!For thee shall none a requiem say?--
    For thee,--who loved the Minstrel's lay,
    For thee, of Bothwell's house the stay,
    The shelter of her exiled line?E'en in this prison house of thine,
    I'll wail for Alpine's honor'd Pine!"What groans shall yonder valleys fill!What shrieks of grief shall rend yon hill!What tears of burning rage shall thrill,
    When mourns thy tribe thy battles done,
    Thy fall before the race was won,
    Thy sword ungirt ere set of sun!There breathes not clansman of thy line,
    But would have given his life for thine.--
    Oh, woe for Alpine's honor'd Pine!"Sad was thy lot on mortal stage!--
    The captive thrush may brook the cage,
    The prison'd eagle dies for rage.And, when its notes awake again,
    Even she, so long beloved in vain,
    Shall with my harp her voice combine,
    And mix her woe and tears with mine,
    To wail Clan-Alpine's honor'd Pine."--

[355] The region bordering Loch Tay.Ellen, the while, with bursting heart,
    Remain'd in lordly bower apart,
    Where play'd, with many- gleams,
    Through storied[356] pane the rising beams.In vain on gilded roof they fall,
    And lighten'd up a tapestried wall,
    And for her use a menial train
    A rich collation spread in vain.The banquet proud, the chamber gay,
    Scarce drew one curious glance astray;
    Or if she look'd, 'twas but to say,
    With better omen dawn'd the day
    In that lone isle, where waved on high
    The dun deer's hide for canopy;
    Where oft her noble father shared
    The simple meal her care prepared,
    While Lufra, crouching by her side,
    Her station claim'd with jealous pride,
    And Douglas, bent on woodland game,
    Spoke of the chase to Malcolm Graeme,
    Whose answer, oft at random made,
    The wandering of his thoughts betray'd.--
    Those who such simple joys have known,
    Are taught to prize them when they're gone.But sudden, see, she lifts her head!What distant music has the power
    To win her in this woeful hour!'Twas from a turret that o'erhung
    Her latticed bower, the strain was sung.[356] Stained or painted to form pictures illustrating history.LAY OF THE IMPRISONED HUNTSMAN."My hawk is tired of perch and hood,
    My idle greyhound loathes his food,
    My horse is weary of his stall,
    And I am sick of captive thrall.I wish I were, as I have been,
    Hunting the hart in forest green,
    With bended bow and bloodhound free,
    For that's the life is meet for me."I hate to learn the ebb of time,
    From yon dull steeple's drowsy chime,
    Or mark it as the sunbeams crawl,
    Inch after inch, along the wall.The lark was wont my matins ring,
    The sable rook my vespers sing;
    These towers, although a king's they be,
    Have not a hall of joy for me."No more at dawning morn I rise,
    And sun myself in Ellen's eyes,
    Drive the fleet deer the forest through,
    And homeward wend with evening dew;
    A blithesome welcome blithely meet,
    And lay my trophies at her feet,
    While fled the eve on wing of glee,--
    That life is lost to love and me!"The heart-sick lay was hardly said,
    The list'ner had not turn'd her head,
    It trickled still, the starting tear,
    When light a footstep struck her ear,
    And Snowdoun's graceful Knight was near.She turn'd the hastier, lest again
    The prisoner should renew his strain."Oh, welcome, brave Fitz-James!"she said;
    "How may an almost orphan maid
    Pay the deep debt"--"Oh, say not so!the boon to give,
    And bid thy noble father live;
    I can but be thy guide, sweet maid,
    With Scotland's King thy suit to aid.No tyrant he, though ire and pride
    May lay his better mood aside.'tis more than time--
    He holds his court at morning prime."With beating heart, and bosom wrung,
    As to a brother's arm she clung.Gently he dried the falling tear,
    And gently whisper'd hope and cheer;
    Her faltering steps half led, half stayed,[357]
    Through gallery fair and high arcade,
    Till, at his touch, its wings of pride
    A portal arch unfolded wide.Within 'twas brilliant all and light,
    A thronging scene of figures bright;
    It glow'd on Ellen's dazzled sight,
    As when the setting sun has given
    Ten thousand hues to summer even,
    And from their tissue, fancy frames
    Aerial[358] knights and fairy dames.Still by Fitz-James her footing staid;
    A few faint steps she forward made,
    Then slow her drooping head she raised,
    And fearful round the presence[359] gazed;
    For him she sought, who own'd this state,
    The dreaded Prince, whose will was fate!--
    She gazed on many a princely port,
    Might well have ruled a royal court;
    On many a splendid garb she gazed,
    Then turn'd bewilder'd and amazed,
    For all stood bare; and, in the room,
    Fitz-James alone wore cap and plume.To him each lady's look was lent;
    On him each courtier's eye was bent;
    Midst furs, and silks, and jewels sheen,
    He stood, in simple Lincoln green,
    The center of the glittering ring,--
    And Snowdoun's Knight[360] is Scotland's King.[360] James V. was accustomed to make personal investigation of the
condition of his people.The name he generally assumed when in disguise
was "Laird of Ballingeich."As wreath of snow, on mountain breast,
    Slides from the rock that gave it rest,
    Poor Ellen glided from her stay,
    And at the Monarch's feet she lay;
    No word her choking voice commands,--
    She show'd the ring--she clasp'd her hands.not a moment could he brook,
    The generous Prince, that suppliant look!Gently he raised her; and, the while,
    Check'd with a glance the circle's smile;
    Graceful, but grave, her brow he kiss'd,
    And bade her terrors be dismiss'd:--
    "Yes, Fair; the wandering poor Fitz-James
    The fealty of Scotland claims.To him thy woes, thy wishes, bring;
    He will redeem his signet ring.Ask naught for Douglas; yestereven,
    His Prince and he have much forgiven:
    Wrong hath he had from slanderous tongue--
    I, from his rebel kinsmen, wrong.We would not, to the vulgar crowd,
    Yield what they craved with clamor loud;
    Calmly we heard and judged his cause,
    Our council aided, and our laws.I stanch'd thy father's death-feud stern
    With stout De Vaux and gray Glencairn;
    And Bothwell's Lord henceforth we own
    The friend and bulwark of our Throne.--
    But, lovely infidel, how now?Lord James of Douglas, lend thine aid;
    Thou must confirm this doubting maid."Then forth the noble Douglas sprung,
    And on his neck his daughter hung.The Monarch drank, that happy hour,
    The sweetest, holiest draught of Power,--
    When it can say, with godlike voice,
    Arise, sad Virtue, and rejoice!Yet would not James the general eye
    On Nature's raptures long should pry;
    He stepp'd between--"Nay, Douglas, nay,
    Steal not my proselyte away!The riddle 'tis my right to read,
    That brought this happy chance to speed.[361]
    Yes, Ellen, when disguised I stray
    In life's more low but happier way,
    'Tis under name which veils my power;
    Nor falsely veils--for Stirling's tower
    Of yore the name of Snowdoun claims,
    And Normans call me James Fitz-James.Thus watch I o'er insulted laws,
    Thus learn to right the injured cause."--
    Then, in a tone apart and low,--
    "Ah, little traitress!none must know
    What idle dream, what lighter thought,
    What vanity full dearly bought,
    Join'd to thine eye's dark witchcraft, drew
    My spellbound steps to Benvenue,
    In dangerous hour, and all but gave
    Thy Monarch's life to mountain glaive!"--
    Aloud he spoke,--"Thou still dost hold
    That little talisman of gold,
    Pledge of my faith, Fitz-James's ring--
    What seeks fair Ellen of the King?"Full well the conscious maiden guess'd
    He probed the weakness of her breast;
    But, with that consciousness, there came
    A lightening of her fears for Graeme,
    And more she deem'd the Monarch's ire
    Kindled 'gainst him, who, for her sire,
    Rebellious broadsword boldly drew;
    And, to her generous feeling true,
    She craved the grace of Roderick Dhu."Forbear thy suit:--the King of kings
    Alone can stay life's parting wings.I know his heart, I know his hand,
    Have shared his cheer, and proved his brand;--
    My fairest earldom would I give
    To bid Clan-Alpine's Chieftain live!--
    Hast thou no other boon to crave?Blushing, she turn'd her from the King,
    And to the Douglas gave the ring,
    As if she wish'd her sire to speak
    The suit that stain'd her glowing cheek.--
    "Nay, then, my pledge has lost its force,
    And stubborn Justice holds her course.--
    Malcolm, come forth!"--and, at the word,
    Down kneel'd the Graeme to Scotland's Lord."For thee, rash youth, no suppliant sues,
    From thee may Vengeance claim her dues,
    Who, nurtured underneath our smile,
    Hast paid our care by treacherous wile,
    And sought, amid thy faithful clan,
    A refuge for an outlaw'd man,
    Dishonoring thus thy loyal name.--
    Fetters and warder for the Graeme!"--
    His chain of gold the King unstrung,
    The links o'er Malcolm's neck he flung,
    Then gently drew the glittering band,
    And laid the clasp on Ellen's hand.The hills grow dark,
      On purple peaks a deeper shade descending;
    In twilight copse the glowworm lights her spark,
      The deer, half seen, are to the covert wending.the fountain lending,
      And the wild breeze, thy wilder minstrelsy;
    Thy numbers sweet with Nature's vespers blending,
      With distant echo from the fold and lea,
    And herd-boy's evening pipe, and hum of housing[362] bee.Yet, once again, farewell, thou Minstrel Harp!Yet, once again, forgive my feeble sway!And little reck I of the censure sharp
      May idly cavil at an idle lay.Much have I owed thy strains on life's long way,
      Through secret woes the world has never known,
    When on the weary night dawn'd wearier day,
      And bitterer was the grief devour'd alone.That I o'erlived such woes, Enchantress!as my lingering footsteps slow retire,
      Some Spirit of the Air has waked thy string!'Tis now a seraph bold, with touch of fire--
      'Tis now the brush of Fairy's frolic wing.Receding now, the dying numbers ring
      Fainter and fainter down the rugged dell,
    And now the mountain breezes scarcely bring
      A wandering witch note of the distant spell--
    And now, 'tis silent all!--Enchantress, fare thee well!A series of arches supported by columns or piers, either open
or backed by masonry.A kind of cap or head gear formerly worn by soldiers.A wall or rampart around the top of a castle, with openings
to look through and annoy the enemy.A capacious drinking cup or can formerly made of waxed
leather.A person knighted on some other ground than that of
military service; a knight who has not known the hardships of war.To grapple; to come to close quarters in fight.A kind of cap worn by Scottish matrons.The plume or decoration on the top of a helmet.The ridge of the neck of a horse or dog.A bridge at the entrance of a castle, which, when lowered
by chains, gave access across the moat or ditch surrounding the

intended to strike another.Pertaining to that political form in which there was a chain of
persons holding land of one another on condition of performing certain
services.Every man in the chain was bound to his immediate superior,
held land from him, took oath of allegiance to him, and became his man.A trumpet call; a fanfare or prelude by one or more trumpets
performed on the approach of any person of distinction.The front of a stag's head; the horns.A long-handled weapon armed with a steel point, and having a
crosspiece of steel with a cutting edge.An upper garment of leather, worn for defense by common soldiers.It was sometimes strengthened by small pieces of metal stitched into it."To give law" to a stag is to allow it a start of a certain
distance or time before the hounds are slipped, the object being to
insure a long chase.A cage for hawks while mewing or moulting: hence an inclosure, a
place of confinement.In the Roman Catholic Church the first canonical hour of prayer,
six o'clock in the morning, generally the first quarter of the day.A stout staff used as a weapon of defense.In using it,
one hand was placed in the middle, and the other halfway between the

fur for garments.A guarding or defensive position or motion in fencing._The Lady of the Lake_ is usually read in the first year of the high
school course, and it is with this fact in mind that the following
suggestions have been made.It is an excellent book with which to begin
the study of the ordinary forms of poetry, of plot structure, and the
simpler problems of description.For this reason in the exercises that
follow the emphasis has been placed on these topics._The Lady of the Lake_ is an excellent example of the minor epic.Corresponding to the "Arms and the man I sing," of the AEneid, and the
invocation to the Muse, are the statement of the theme, "Knighthood's
dauntless deed and Beauty's matchless eye," and the invocation to the
Harp of the North, in the opening stanzas.For the heroes, descendants
of the gods, of the great epic, we have a king, the chieftain of a
great clan, an outlaw earl and his daughter, characters less elevated
than those of the great epic, but still important.The element of the
supernatural brought in by the gods and goddesses of the epic is here
supplied by the minstrel, Brian the priest, and the harp.The interest
of the poem lies in the incidents as with the epic.The romantic story
of Ellen and Malcolm, however, lies quite outside the realm of the
great epic, which is concerned with the fate of a state or body of
people rather than with that of an individual.There are two threads to the story, one concerned with the love story
of Ellen and Malcolm, the main plot; and one with Roderick and his clan
against the King, the minor plot.The connection between them is very
slight, the story of Ellen could have been told almost without the
other, but the struggle of the Clan makes a fine background for the
love story of Ellen and Malcolm.The plot is an excellent one for the
beginner to study as the structure is so evident.The following is a
simple outline of the main incidents of the story.The coming of the stranger, later supposed by Roderick to
      be a spy of the King.The return of Douglas, guided by Malcolm, an act which
      brings Malcolm under the displeasure of the King.Roderick's proposal for Ellen's hand in order to avert the
      danger threatening Ellen and Douglas because of the recognition
      of the latter by the King's men.The rejection of the proposal, leading to the withdrawal of
      Ellen and her father to Coir-Uriskin and the departure of
      Douglas to the court to save Roderick and Malcolm.The preparations for war made by Roderick, including the
      sending of the Fiery Cross, and the Taghairm.Ellen and Allan-Bane at Coir-Uriskin.Douglas on his way to give himself up.The triumph of Fitz-James over Roderick.The interest reawakened in the King by Douglas's prowess
      and generosity.The battle of Beal 'an Duine.All of Scott's works afford excellent models of description for the
beginner in this very difficult form of composition.He deals with
the problems of description in a simple and evident manner.In most
cases he begins his description with the point of view, and chooses
the details in accordance with that point of view.The principle of
order used in the arrangement of the details is usually easy to find
and follow, and the beauty of his contrasts, the vanity and vividness
of his diction can be in a measure appreciated even by boys and girls
in the first year of the high school.If properly taught a pupil must
leave the study of the poem with a new sense of the power of words.In his description of character Scott deals with the most simple and
elemental emotions and is therefore fairly easy to imitate.In the
special topics under each canto special emphasis has been laid upon
description because of the adaptability of _his_ description to the needs
of the student.SPECIAL STUDIES IN THE CANTOS.CANTO I.

TEACHERS' OUTLINES FOR STUDIES IN ENGLISH

Based on the Requirements for Admission to College

By GILBERT SYKES BLAKELY, A.M., Instructor in English in the Morris
High School, New York City.This little book is intended to present to teachers plans for the study
of the English texts required for admission to college.These Outlines
are full of inspiration and suggestion, and will be welcomed by every
live teacher who hitherto, in order to avoid ruts, has been obliged to
compare notes with other teachers, visit classes, and note methods.The volume aims not at a discussion of the principles of teaching, but
at an application of certain principles to the teaching of some of the
books most generally read in schools.¶ The references by page and line to the book under discussion are to
the texts of the Gateway Series; but the Outlines can be used with any
series of English classics.¶ Certain brief plans of study are developed for the general teaching
of the novel, narrative poetry, lyric poetry, the drama, and the
essay.The suggestions are those of a practical teacher, and follow a
definite scheme in each work to be studied.There are discussions of
methods, topics for compositions, and questions for review.The lists
of questions are by no means exhaustive, but those that are given are
suggestive and typical.¶ The appendix contains twenty examinations in English, for admission
to college, recently set by different colleges in both the East and the
West.AMERICAN BOOK COMPANY

HALLECK'S NEW ENGLISH LITERATURE

By REUBEN POST HALLECK, M. A., LL.D. author of History of English
Literature, and History of American Literature.This New English Literature preserves the qualities which have caused
the author's former History of English Literature to be so widely used;
namely, suggestiveness, clearness, organic unity, interest, and power
to awaken thought and to stimulate the student to further reading.¶ Here are presented the new facts which have recently been brought
to light, and the new points of view which have been adopted.More
attention is paid to recent writers.The present critical point of
view concerning authors, which has been brought about by the new
social spirit, is reflected.Many new and important facts concerning
the Elizabethan theater and the drama of Shakespeare's time are
incorporated.¶ Other special features are the unusually detailed Suggested Readings
that follow each chapter, suggestions and references for a literary
trip to England, historical introductions to the chapters, careful
treatment of the modern drama, and a new and up-to-date bibliography.¶ Over 200 pictures selected for their pedagogical value and their
unusual character appear in their appropriate places in connection with
the text.The frontispiece, in colors, shows the performance of an
Elizabethan play in the Fortune Theater.AMERICAN BOOK COMPANY

A HISTORY OF AMERICAN LITERATURE

By REUBEN POST HALLECK, M.A., Principal, Male High School, Louisville,
Ky.A companion volume to the author's History of English Literature.It describes the greatest achievements in American literature from
colonial times to the present, placing emphasis not only upon men,
but also upon literary movements, the causes of which are thoroughly
investigated.Further, the relation of each period of American
literature to the corresponding epoch of English literature has been
carefully brought out--and each period is illuminated by a brief survey
of its history.¶ The seven chapters of the book treat in succession of Colonial
Literature, The Emergence of a Nation (1754-1809), the New York Group,
The New England Group, Southern Literature, Western Literature, and
the Eastern Realists.To these are added a supplementary list of less
important authors and their chief works, as well as A Glance Backward,
which emphasizes in brief compass the most important truths taught by
American literature.¶ At the end of each chapter is a summary which helps to fix the
period in mind by briefly reviewing the most significant achievements.This is followed by extensive historical and literary references for
further study, by a very helpful list of suggested readings, and by
questions and suggestions, designed to stimulate the student's interest
and enthusiasm, and to lead him to study and investigate further for
himself the remarkable literary record of American aspiration and
accomplishment.AMERICAN BOOK COMPANY

Transcriber's Notes:

     Underscores "_" before and after a word or phrase indicate italics
       in the original text.The word "onomatopoeia" uses an "oe" ligature in the original.A few words use diacritical characters in the original.Unfortunately,
this last premeditation was the only one which sustained disappointment,
for, our little craft being tender to the flag-ship of the station, all
our hard-earned prize-money had to be equally shared with her officers
and crew, which reduced the shares to fewer pence each than they
otherwise would have been pounds, and which was a burning shame.It was the Cape winter when I joined the gunboat.The hills were
covered with purple and green, the air was deliciously cool, and the
far-away mountain-tops were clad in virgin snow.It was twelve o'clock
noon when I took my traps on board, and found my new messmates seated
around the table at tiffin.The gunroom, called the wardroom by
courtesy--for the after cabin was occupied by the lieutenant
commanding--was a little morsel of an apartment, which the table and
five cane-bottomed chairs entirely filled.The officers were five--
namely, a little round-faced, dimple-cheeked, good-natured fellow, who
was our second-master; a tall and rather awkward-looking young
gentleman, our midshipman; a lean, pert, and withal diminutive youth,
brimful of his own importance, our assistant-paymaster; a fair-haired,
bright-eyed, laughing boy from Cornwall, our sub-lieutenant; and a "wee
wee man," dapper, clean, and tidy, our engineer, admitted to this mess
because he was so thorough an exception to his class, which is
celebrated more for the unctuosity of its outer than for the smoothness
of its inner man."Come along, old fellow," said our navigator, addressing me as I entered
the messroom, bobbing and bowing to evade fracture of the cranium by
coming into collision with the transverse beams of the deck above--"come
along and join us, we don't dine till four.""And precious little to dine upon," said the officer on his right."Steward, let us have the rum," [Note 1] cried the first speaker.And thus addressed, the steward shuffled in, bearing in his hand a black
bottle, and apparently in imminent danger of choking himself on a large
mouthful of bread and butter.This functionary's dress was remarkable
rather for its simplicity than its purity, consisting merely of a pair
of dirty canvas pants, a pair of purser's shoes--innocent as yet of
blacking--and a greasy flannel shirt.But, indeed, uniform seemed to be
the exception, and not the rule, of the mess, for, while one wore a blue
serge jacket, another was arrayed in white linen, and the rest had
neither jacket nor vest.The table was guiltless of a cloth, and littered with beer-bottles,
biscuits, onions, sardines, and pats of butter.exclaimed the sub-lieutenant; "that beggar
Dawson is having his own whack o' grog and everybody else's."I'll have _my_ tot to-day, I know," said the
assistant-paymaster, snatching the bottle from Dawson, and helping
himself to a very liberal allowance of the ruby fluid.cried the midshipman, snatching the
glass from the table and bolting the contents at a gulp, adding, with a
gasp of satisfaction as he put down the empty tumbler, "The chap thinks
nobody's got a soul to be saved but himself.""Soul or no soul," replied the youthful man of money as he gazed
disconsolately at the empty glass, "my _spirit's_ gone.""Blessed," said the engineer, shaking the black bottle, "if you devils
have left me a drain!see if I don't look out for A1 to-morrow."And they all said "Where is the doctor's?""See if that beggarly bumboat-man is alongside, and get me another pat
of butter and some soft tack; get the grub first, then tell him I'll pay
to-morrow."These and such like scraps of conversation began to give me a little
insight into the kind of mess I had joined and the character of my
future messmates."Steward," said I, "show me my cabin."He did so;
indeed, he hadn't far to go.It was the aftermost, and consequently the
smallest, although I _ought_ to have had my choice.It was the most
miserable little box I ever reposed in.Had I owned such a place on
shore, I _might_ have been induced to keep rabbits in it, or
guinea-pigs, but certainly not pigeons.Its length was barely six feet,
its width four above my cot and two below, and it was minus sufficient
standing-room for any ordinary-sized sailor; it was, indeed, a cabin for
a commodore--I mean Commodore Nutt--and was ventilated by a scuttle
seven inches in diameter, which could only be removed in harbour, and
below which, when we first went to sea, I was fain to hang a leather
hat-box to catch the water; unfortunately the bottom rotted out, and I
was then at the mercy of the waves.My cabin, or rather--to stick to the plain unvarnished truth--my burrow,
was alive with scorpions, cockroaches, ants, and other "crawlin'
ferlies.""That e'en to name would be unlawfu'."My dispensary was off the steerage, and sister-cabin to the pantry.To
it I gained access by a species of crab-walking, squeezing myself past a
large brass pump, and edging my body in sideways.The sick came one by
one to the dispensary door, and there I saw and treated each case as it
arrived, dressed the wounds and bruises and putrefying sores, and
bandaged the bad legs.There was no sick-berth attendant; to be sure
the lieutenant-in-command, at my request, told off "a little cabin-boy"
for my especial use.I had no cause for delectation on such an
acquisition, by no means; he was not a model cabin-boy like what you see
in theatres, and I believe will never become an admiral.He managed at
times to wash out the dispensary, or gather cockroaches, and make the
poultices--only in doing the first he broke the bottles, and in
performing the last duty he either let the poultice burn or put salt in
it; and, finally, he smashed my pot, and I kicked him forward, and
demanded another._He_ was slightly better, only he was seldom visible;
and when I set him to do anything, he at once went off into a sweet
slumber; so I kicked him forward too, and had in despair to become my
own menial.In both dispensary and burrow it was quite a difficult
business to prevent everything going to speedy destruction.The best
portions of my uniform got eaten by cockroaches or moulded by damp,
while my instruments required cleaning every morning, and even that did
not keep rust at bay.Imagine yourself dear reader, in any of the following interesting
positions:--

Very thirsty, and nothing but boiling hot newly distilled water to
drink; or wishing a cool bath of a morning, and finding the water in
your can only a little short of 212 degrees Fahrenheit.To find, when you awake, a couple of cockroaches, two inches in length,
busy picking your teeth.To find one in a state of decay in the mustard-pot.To have to arrange all the droppings and eggs of these interesting
creatures on the edge of your plate, previous to eating your soup.To have to beat out the dust and weevils from every square inch of
biscuit before putting it in your mouth.To be looking for a book and put your hand on a full-grown scaly
scorpion.Nice sensation--the animal twining round your finger, or
running up your sleeve._Denouement_--cracking him under foot--
full-flavoured bouquet--joy at escaping a sting.You are enjoying your dinner, but have been for some time sensible of a
strange titillating feeling about the region of your ankle; you look down
at last to find a centipede on your sock, with his fifty hind-legs--you
thank God not his fore fifty--abutting on to your shin._Tableau_--
green and red light from the eyes of the many-legged; horror of yourself
as you wait till he thinks proper to "move on."To awake in the morning, and find a large and healthy-looking tarantula
squatting on your pillow within ten inches of your nose, with his
basilisk eyes fixed on yours, and apparently saying, "You're only just
awake, are you?I've been sitting here all the morning watching you."You know if you move he'll bite you, somewhere; and if he _does_ bite
you, you'll go mad and dance _ad libitum_; so you twist your mouth in
the opposite direction and ejaculate--

"Steward!"but the steward does not come--in fact he is forward, seeing
after the breakfast.Meanwhile the gentleman on the pillow is moving
his horizontal mandibles in a most threatening manner, and just as he
makes a rush for your nose you tumble out of bed with a shriek; and, if
a very nervous person, probably run on deck in your shirt.Or, to fall asleep under the following circumstances: The bulkheads, all
around, black with cock-and-hen-roaches, a few of which are engaged
cropping your toe-nails, or running off with little bits of the skin of
your calves; bugs in the crevices of your cot, a flea tickling the sole
of your foot, a troop of ants carrying a dead cockroach over your
pillow, lively mosquitoes attacking you everywhere, hammer-legged flies
occasionally settling on your nose, rats running in and rats running
out, your lamp just going out, and the delicious certainty that an
indefinite number of earwigs and scorpions, besides two centipedes and a
tarantula, are hiding themselves somewhere in your cabin.Officers, as well as men, are allowed one half-gill of rum
daily, with this difference,--the former pay for theirs, while the
latter do not.ROUND THE CAPE AND UP THE 'BIQUE.It was a dark-grey cloudy forenoon when we "up anchor" and sailed from
Simon's Bay.Frequent squalls whitened the water, and there was every
indication of our being about to have dirty weather; and the tokens told
no lies.To our little craft, however, the foul weather that followed
seemed to be a matter of very little moment; for, when the wind or waves
were in any way high, she kept snugly below water, evidently thinking
more of her own convenience than our comfort, for such a procedure on
her part necessitated our leading a sort of amphibious existence, better
suited to the tastes of frogs than human beings.Our beds too, or
matresses, became converted into gigantic poultices, in which we nightly
steamed, like as many porkers newly shaven.Judging from the amount of
salt which got encrusted on our skins, there was little need to fear
danger, we were well preserved--so much so indeed, that, but for the
constant use of the matutinal freshwater bath, we would doubtless have
shared the fate of Lot's wife and been turned into pillars of salt.After being a few days at sea the wind began to moderate, and finally
died away; and instead thereof we had thunderstorms and waves, which, if
not so big as mountains, would certainly have made pretty large hills.Many a night did we linger on deck till well nigh morning, entranced by
the sublime beauty and terrible grandeur of those thunderstorms.The
roar and rattle of heaven's artillery; the incessant _floods_ of
lightning--crimson, blue, or white; our little craft hanging by the bows
to the crest of each huge inky billow, or next moment buried in the
valley of the waves, with a wall of black waters on every side; the wet
deck, the slippery shrouds, and the faces of the men holding on to the
ropes and appearing so strangely pale in the electric light; I see the
whole picture even now as I write--a picture, indeed, that can never,
never fade from my memory.Our cruising "ground" lay between the island and town of Mozambique in
the south, to about Magadoxa, some seven or eight degrees north of the
Equator.Nearly the whole of the slave-trade is carried on by the Arabs, one or
two Spaniards sometimes engaging in it likewise.The slaves are brought
from the far interior of South Africa, where they can be purchased for a
small bag of rice each.They are taken down in chained gangs to the
coast, and there in some secluded bay the dhows lie, waiting to take
them on board and convey them to the slave-mart at Zanzibar, to which
place Arab merchants come from the most distant parts of Arabia and
Persia to buy them.Dhows are vessels with one or two masts, and a
corresponding number of large sails, and of a very peculiar
construction, being shaped somewhat like a short or Blucher boot, the
high part of the boot representing the poop.They have a thatched roof
over the deck, the projecting eaves of which render boarding exceedingly
difficult to an enemy.Sometimes, on rounding the corner of a lagoon island, we would quietly
and unexpectedly steam into the midst of a fleet of thirty to forty of
these queer-looking vessels, very much to our own satisfaction, and
their intense consternation.Imagine a cat popping down among as many
mice, and you will be able to form some idea of the scramble that
followed.However, by dint of steaming here and there, and expending a
great deal of shot and shell, we generally managed to keep them together
as a dog would a flock of sheep, until we examined all their papers with
the aid of our interpreter, and probably picked out a prize.I wish I could say the prizes were anything like numerous; for perhaps
one-half of all the vessels we board are illicit slaveholders, and yet
we cannot lay a finger on them.It has been
said, and it is generally believed in England, that our cruisers are
sweeping the Indian Ocean of slavers, and stamping out the curse.But
the truth is very different, and all that we are doing, or able at
present to do, is but to pull an occasional hair from the hoary locks of
the fiend Slavery.This can be proved from the return-sheets, which
every cruiser sends home, of the number of vessels boarded, generally
averaging one thousand yearly to each man-o'-war, of which the half at
least have slaves or slave-irons on board; but only two, or at most
three, of these will become prizes.The reason of this will easily be
understood, when the reader is informed, that the Sultan of Zanzibar has
liberty to take any number of slaves from any one portion of his
dominions to another: these are called household slaves; and, as his
dominions stretch nearly all along the eastern shores of Africa, it is
only necessary for the slave-dealer to get his sanction and seal to his
papers in order to steer clear of British law.This, in almost every
case, can be accomplished by means of a bribe.So slavery flourishes,
the Sultan draws a good fat revenue from it, and the Portuguese--no
great friends to us at any time--laugh and wink to see John Bull paying
his thousands yearly for next to nothing.Supposing we liberate even
two thousand slaves a year, which I am not sure we do however, there are
on the lowest estimate six hundred slaves bought and sold daily in
Zanzibar mart; two hundred and nineteen thousand in a twelvemonth; and,
of our two thousand that are set free in Zanzibar, most, if not all,
by-and-bye, become bondsmen again.I am not an advocate for slavery, and would like to see a wholesale raid
made against it, but I do not believe in the retail system; selling
freedom in pennyworths, and spending millions in doing it, is very like
burning a penny candle in seeking for a cent.Yet I sincerely believe,
that there is more good done to the spread of civilisation and religion
in one year, by the slave-traffic, than all our missionaries can do in a
hundred.Don't open your eyes and smile incredulously, intelligent
reader; we live in an age when every question is looked at on both
sides, and why should not this?What becomes of the hundreds of
thousands of slaves that are taken from Africa?They are sold to the
Arabs--that wonderful race, who have been second only to Christians in
the good they have done to civilisation; they are taken from a state of
degradation, bestiality, and wretchedness, worse by far than that of the
wild beasts, and from a part of the country too that is almost unfit to
live in, and carried to more favoured lands, spread over the sunny
shores of fertile Persia and Arabia, fed and clothed and cared for;
after a few years of faithful service they are even called sons and feed
at their master's table--taught all the trades and useful arts, besides
the Mahommedan religion, which is certainly better than none--and, above
all, have a better chance given them of one day hearing and learning the
beautiful tenets of Christianity, the religion of love.I have met with few slaves who after a few years did not say, "Praised
be Allah for the good day I was take from me coontry!"and whose only
wish to return was, that they might bring away some aged parent, or
beloved sister, from the dark cheerless home of their infancy.Means and measures much more energetic must be brought into action if
the stronghold of slavedom is to be stormed, and, if not, it were better
to leave it alone."If the work be of God ye cannot overthrow it; lest
haply ye be found to fight even against God."THE DAYS WHEN WE WENT GIPSYING.QUILP THE
PILOT AND LAMOO.It might have been that our vessel was launched on a Friday, or sailed
on a Friday; or whether it was owing to our carrying the devil on board
of us in shape of a big jet-black cat, and for whom the lifebuoy was
thrice let go, and boats lowered in order to save his infernal majesty
from a watery grave; but whatever was the reason, she was certainly a
most unlucky ship from first to last; for during a cruise of eighteen
months, four times did we run aground on dangerous reefs, twice were we
on fire--once having had to scuttle the decks--once we sprung a bad leak
and were nearly foundering, several times we narrowly escaped the same
speedy termination to our cruise by being taken aback, while, compared
to our smaller dangers or lesser perils, Saint Paul's adventures--as a
Yankee would express it--wern't a circumstance.On the other hand, we were amply repaid by the many beautiful spots we
visited; the lovely wooded creeks where the slave-dhows played at hide
and seek with us, and the natural harbours, at times surrounded by
scenery so sweetly beautiful and so charmingly solitary, that, if
fairies still linger on this earth, one must think they would choose
just such places as these for their moonlight revels.Then there were
so many little towns--Portuguese settlements--to be visited, for the
Portuguese have spread themselves, after the manner of wild
strawberries, all round the coast of Africa, from Sierra Leone on the
west to Zanzibar on the east.There was as much sameness about these
settlements as about our visits to them: a few houses--more like tents--
built on the sand (it does seem funny to see sofas, chairs, and the
piano itself standing among the deep soft sand); a fort, the guns of
which, if fired, would bring down the walls; a few white-jacketed
swarthy-looking soldiers; a very polite governor, brimful of hospitality
and broken English; and a good dinner, winding up with punch of
schnapps.Memorable too are the pleasant boating excursions we had on the calm
bosom of the Indian Ocean.Armed boats used to be detached to cruise
for three or four weeks at a time in quest of prizes, at the end of
which time they were picked up at some place of rendezvous.By day we
sailed about the coast and around the small wooded islets, where dhows
might lurk, only landing in sheltered nooks to cook and eat our food.Our provisions were ship's, but at times we drove great bargains with
the naked natives for fowls and eggs and goats; then would we make
delicious soups, rich ragouts, and curries fit for the king of the
Cannibal Islands.Fruit too we had in plenty, and the best of oysters
for the gathering, with iguana most succulent of lizards, occasionally
fried flying-fish, or delicate morsels of shark, skip-jack, or devilled
dolphin, with a glass of prime rum to wash the whole down, and three
grains of quinine to charm away the fever.There was, too, about these
expeditions, an air of gipsying that was quite pleasant.To be sure our
beds were a little hard, but we did not mind that; while clad in our
blanket-suits, and covered with a boat-sail, we could defy the dew.Sleep, or rather the want of sleep, we seldom had to complain of, for
the blue star-lit sky above us, the gentle rising and falling of the
anchored boat, the lip-lipping of the water, and the sighing sound of
the wind through the great forest near us--all tended to woo us to
sweetest slumber.Sometimes we would make long excursions up the rivers of Africa,
combining business with pleasure, enjoying the trip, and at the same
time gleaning some useful information regarding slave or slave-ship.The following sketch concerning one or two of these may tend to show,
that a man does not take leave of all enjoyment, when his ship leaves
the chalky cliffs of old England.Our anchor was dropped outside the bar of Inambane river; the grating
noise of the chain as it rattled through the hawse-hole awoke me, and I
soon after went on deck.It was just six o'clock and a beautiful clear
morning, with the sun rising red and rosy--like a portly gentleman
getting up from his wine--and smiling over the sea in quite a pleasant
sort of way.So, as both Neptune and Sol seemed propitious, the
commander, our second-master, and myself made up our minds to visit the
little town and fort of Inambane, about forty--we thought fifteen--miles
up the river.But breakfast had to be prepared and eaten, the magazine
and arms got into the boat, besides a day's provisions, with rum and
quinine to be stowed away, so that the sun had got a good way up the
sky, and now looked more like a portly gentleman whose dinner had
disagreed, before we had got fairly under way and left the ship's side.Never was forenoon brighter or fairer, only one or two snowy banks of
cloud interrupting the blue of the sky, while the river, miles broad,
stole silently seaward, unruffled by wave or wavelet, so that the hearts
of both men and officers were light as the air they breathed was pure.The men, bending cheerfully on their oars, sang snatches of Dibdin--
Neptune's poet laureate; and we, tired of talking, reclined astern,
gazing with half-shut eyes on the round undulating hills, that, covered
with low mangrove-trees and large exotics, formed the banks of the
river.We passed numerous small wooded islands and elevated sandbanks,
on the edges of which whole regiments of long-legged birds waded about
in search of food, or, starting at our approach, flew over our heads in
Indian file, their bright scarlet-and-white plumage showing prettily
against the blue of the sky.Shoals of turtle floated past, and
hundreds of rainbow- jelly-fishes, while, farther off, many
large black bodies--the backs of hippopotami--moved on the surface of
the water, or anon disappeared with a sullen plash.Saving these sounds
and the dip of our own oars, all was still, the silence of the desert
reigned around us, the quiet of a newly created world.The forenoon wore away, the river got narrower, but, though we could see
a distance of ten miles before us, neither life nor sign of life could
be perceived.At one o'clock we landed among a few cocoa-nut trees to
eat our meagre dinner, a little salt pork, raw, and a bit of biscuit.No sooner had we "shoved off" again than the sky became overcast; we
were caught in, and had to pull against, a blinding white-squall that
would have laid a line-of-battle on her beam ends.The rain poured down
as if from a water-spout, almost filling the boat and drenching us to
the skin, and, not being able to see a yard ahead, our boat ran aground
and stuck fast.It took us a good hour after the squall was over to
drag her into deep water; nor were our misfortunes then at an end, for
squall succeeded squall, and, having a journey of uncertain length still
before us, we began to feel very miserable indeed.It was long after four o'clock when, tired, wet, and hungry, we hailed
with joy a large white house on a wooded promontory; it was the
Governor's castle, and soon after we came in sight of the town itself.Situated so far in the interior of Africa, in a region so wild, few
would have expected to find such a little paradise as we now beheld,--a
colony of industrious Portuguese, a large fort and a company of
soldiers, a governor and consulate, a town of nice little detached
cottages, with rows of cocoa-nut, mango, and orange trees, and in fact
all the necessaries, and luxuries of civilised life.It was, indeed, an
oasis in the desert, and, to us, the most pleasant of pleasant
surprises.Leaving the men for a short time with the boat, we made our way to the
house of the consul, a dapper little gentleman with a pretty wife and
two beautiful daughters--flowers that had hitherto blushed unseen and
wasted their sweetness in the desert air.After making us swallow a glass of brandy
each to keep off fever, he kindly led us to a room, and made us strip
off our wet garments, while a servant brought bundle after bundle of
clothes, and spread them out before us.There were socks and shirts and
slippers galore, with waistcoats, pantaloons, and head-dresses, and
jackets, enough to have dressed an opera troupe.The commander and I
furnished ourselves with a red Turkish fez and dark-grey dressing-gown
each, with cord and tassels to correspond, and, thus, arrayed, we
considered ourselves of no small account.Our kind entertainers were
waiting for us in the next room, where they had, in the mean time, been
preparing for us the most fragrant of brandy punch.By-and-bye two
officers and a tall Parsee dropped in, and for the next hour or so the
conversation was of the most animated and lively description, although a
bystander, had there been one, would not have been much edified, for the
following reason: the younger daughter and myself were flirting in the
ancient Latin language, with an occasional soft word in Spanish; our
commander was talking in bad French to the consul's lady, who was
replying in Portuguese; the second-master was maintaining a smart
discussion in broken Italian with the elder daughter; the Parsee and
officer of the fort chiming in, the former in English, the latter in
Hindostanee; but as no one of the four could have had the slightest idea
of the other's meaning, the amount of information given and received
must have been very small,--in fact, merely nominal.It must not,
however, be supposed that our host or hostesses could speak _no_
English, for the consul himself would frequently, and with a bow that
was inimitable, push the bottle towards the commander, and say, as he
shrugged his shoulders and turned his palms skywards, "Continue you, Sar
Capitan, to wet your whistle;" and, more than once, the fair creature by
my side would raise and did raise the glass to her lips, and say, as her
eyes sought mine, "Good night, Sar Officeer," as if she meant me to be
off to bed without a moment's delay, which I knew she did not.Then,
when I responded to the toast, and complimented her on her knowledge of
the "universal language," she added, with a pretty shake of the head,
"No, Sar Officeer, I no can have speak the mooch Englese."A servant,--
apparently newly out of prison, so closely was his hair cropped,--
interrupted our pleasant confab, and removed the seat of our Babel to
the dining-room, where as nicely-cooked-and-served a dinner as ever
delighted the senses of hungry mortality awaited our attention.No
large clumsy joints, huge misshapen roasts or bulky boils, hampered the
board; but dainty made-dishes, savoury stews, piquant curries, delicate
fricassees whose bouquet tempted even as their taste and flavour
stimulated the appetite, strange little fishes as graceful in shape as
lovely in colour, vegetables that only the rich luxuriance of an African
garden could supply, and numerous other nameless nothings, with
delicious wines and costly liqueurs, neatness, attention, and kindness,
combined to form our repast, and counteract a slight suspicion of
crocodiles' tails and stewed lizard, for where ignorance is bliss a
fellow is surely a fool if he is wise.We spent a most pleasant evening in asking questions, spinning yarns,
singing songs, and making love.The younger daughter--sweet child of
the desert--sang `Amante de alguno;' her sister played a selection from
`La Traviata;' next, the consul's lady favoured us with something
pensive and sad, having reference, I think, to bright eyes, bleeding
hearts, love, and slow death; then, the Parsee chanted a Persian hymn
with an "Allalallala," instead of Fol-di-riddle-ido as a chorus, which
elicited "Fra poco a me" from the Portuguese lieutenant; and this last
caused our commander to seat himself at the piano, turn up the white of
his eyes, and in very lugubrious tones question the probability of
"Gentle Annie's" ever reappearing in any spring-time whatever; then,
amid so much musical sentimentality and woe, it was not likely that I
was to hold my peace, so I lifted up my voice and sang--

  "Cauld kail in Aberdeen,
  An' cas ticks in Strathbogie;
  Ilka chiel maun hae a quean
  Bit leeze me on ma cogie--"

with a pathos that caused the tears to trickle over and adown the nose
of the younger daughter--she was of the gushing temperament--and didn't
leave a dry eye in the room.The song brought down the house--so to
speak--and I was the hero for the rest of the evening.Before parting
for the night we also sang `Auld lang syne,' copies of the words having
been written out and distributed, to prevent mistakes; this was supposed
by our hostess to be the English national anthem.It was with no small amount of regret that we parted from our friends
next day; a fresh breeze carried us down stream, and, except our running
aground once or twice, and being nearly drowned in crossing the bar, we
arrived safely on board our saucy gunboat.------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Afric's sunny fountains" have been engaged for such a length of time in
the poetical employment of "rolling down their golden sands," that a
bank or bar of that same bright material has been formed at the mouth of
every river, which it is very difficult and often dangerous to cross
even in canoes.We had despatched boats before us to take soundings on
the bar of Lamoo, and prepared to follow in the track thus marked out.Now, our little bark, although not warranted, like the Yankee boat, to
float wherever there is a heavy dew, was nevertheless content with a
very modest allowance of the aqueous element; in two and a half fathoms
she was quite at home, and even in two--with the help of a few
breakers--she never failed to bump it over a bar.We approached the bar
of Lamoo, therefore, with a certain degree of confidence till the keel
rasped on the sand; this caused us to turn astern till we rasped again;
then, being neither able to get back nor forward, we stopped ship, put
our fingers in our wise mouths, and tried to consider what next was to
be done.Just then a small canoe was observed coming bobbing over the
big waves that tumbled in on the bar; at one moment it was hidden behind
a breaker, next moment mounting over another, and so, after a little
game at bo-peep, it got alongside, and from it there scrambled on board
a little, little man, answering entirely to Dickens's description of
Quilp.added I, "by all that's small and ugly.""Your sarvant, sar," said Quilp himself.There
certainly was not enough of him to make two.He was rather darker in
skin than the Quilp of Dickens, and his only garment was a coal-sack
without sleeves--no coal-sack _has_ sleeves, however--begirt with a
rope, in which a short knife was stuck; he had, besides, sandals on his
feet, and his temples were begirt with a dirty dishclout by way of
turban, and he repeated, "I am one pilot, sar.""I do it, sar, plenty quick."I do him," cried the little man, as he mounted the
bridge; then cocking his head to one side, and spreading out his arms
like a badly feathered duck, he added, "Suppose I no do him plenty
proper, you catchee me and make shot.""If the vessel strikes, I'll hang you, sir."Quilp grinned--which was his way of smiling."And a half three," sung the man in the chains; then, "And a half four;"
and by-and-bye, "And a half three" again; followed next moment by, "By
the deep three."We were on the dreaded bar; on each
side of us the big waves curled and broke with a sullen boom like
far-off thunder; only, where we were, no waves broke."Mind yourself now," cried the commander to Quilp; to which he in wrath
replied--

"What for you stand there make bobbery?_I_ is de cap'n; suppose you is
fear, go alow, sar."and a large wave broke right aboard of us, almost sweeping us
from the deck, and lifting the ship's head into the sky.Another and
another followed; but amid the wet and the spray, and the roar of the
breakers, firmly stood the little pilot, coolly giving his orders, and
never for an instant taking his eyes from the vessel's jib-boom and the
distant shore, till we were safely through the surf and quietly steaming
up the river.After proceeding some miles, native villages began to appear here and
there on both shores, and the great number of dhows on the river, with
boats and canoes of every description, told us we were nearing a large
town.Two hours afterwards we were anchored under the guns of the
Sultan's palace, which were belching forth fire and smoke in return for
the salute we had fired.We found every creature and thing in Lamoo as
entirely primitive, as absolutely foreign, as if it were a city in some
other planet.The most conspicuous building is the Sultan's lofty fort
and palace, with its spacious steps, its fountains and marble halls.The streets are narrow and confused; the houses built in the Arab
fashion, and in many cases connected by bridges at the top; the
inhabitants about forty thousand, including Arabs, Persians, Hindoos,
Somali Indians, and slaves.The wells, exceedingly deep, are built in
the centre of the street without any protection; and girls, carrying on
their heads calabashes, are continually passing to and from them.Slaves, two and two, bearing their burdens of cowries and ivory on poles
between, and keeping step to an impromptu chant; black girls weaving
mats and grass-cloth; strange-looking tradesmen, with stranger tools, at
every door; rich merchants borne along in gilded palanquins; people
praying on housetops; and the Sultan's ferocious soldiery prowling
about, with swords as tall, and guns nearly twice as tall, as
themselves; a large shark-market; a fine bazaar, with gold-dust, ivory,
and tiger-skins exposed for sale; sprightly horses with gaudy trappings;
solemn-looking camels; dust and stench and a general aroma of savage
life and customs pervading the atmosphere, but law and order
nevertheless.No
spirituous liquor of any sort is sold in the town; the Sultan's soldiers
go about the streets at night, smelling the breath of the suspected, and
the faintest odour of the accursed fire-water dooms the poor mortal to
fifty strokes with a thick bamboo-cane next morning.The sugar-cane
grows wild in the fertile suburbs, amid a perfect forest of fine trees;
farther out in the country the cottager dwells beneath his few cocoa-nut
trees, which supply him with all the necessaries of life.One tree for
each member of his family is enough._He_ builds the house and fences
with its large leaves; his wife prepares meat and drink, cloth and oil,
from the nut; the space between the trees is cultivated for curry, and
the spare nuts are sold to purchase luxuries, and the rent of twelve
trees is only _sixpence_ of our money.no drunkenness,
no debt, no religious strife, but peace and contentment everywhere!Reader, if you are in trouble, or your affairs are going "to pot," or if
you are of opinion that this once favoured land is getting used up, I
sincerely advise you to sell off your goods and be off to Lamoo.Of the "gentlemen of England who live at home at ease," very few can
know how entirely dependent for happiness one is on his neighbours.Man
is out-and-out, or out-and-in, a gregarious animal, else `Robinson
Crusoe' had never been written.Now, I am sure that it is only correct
to state that the majority of combatant [Note 1] officers are, in simple
language, jolly nice fellows, and as a class gentlemen, having, in fact,
that fine sense of honour, that good-heartedness, which loves to do as
it would be done by, which hurteth not the feelings of the humble, which
turneth aside from the worm in its path, and delighteth not in plucking
the wings from the helpless fly.To believe, however, that there are no
exceptions to this rule would be to have faith in the speedy advent of
the millennium, that happy period of lamb-and-lion-ism which we would
all rather see than hear tell of; for human nature is by no means
altered by bathing every morning in salt water, it is the same afloat as
on shore.And there are many officers in the navy, who--"dressed in a
little brief authority," and wearing an additional stripe--love to lord
it over their fellow worms.Nor is this fault altogether absent from
the medical profession itself!It is in small gunboats, commanded perhaps by a lieutenant, and carrying
only an assistant-surgeon, where a young medical officer feels all the
hardships and despotism of the service; for if the lieutenant in command
happens to be at all frog-hearted, he has then a splendid opportunity of
puffing himself up.In a large ship with from twenty to thirty officers in the mess, if you
do not happen to meet with a kindred spirit at one end of the table, you
can shift your chair to the other.But in a gunboat on foreign service,
with merely a clerk, a blatant middy, and a second-master who would fain
be your senior, as your messmates, then, I say, God help you!unless you
have the rare gift of doing anything for a quiet life.It is all
nonsense to say, "Write a letter on service about any grievance;" you
can't write about ten out of a thousand of the petty annoyances which go
to make your life miserable; and if you do, you will be but little
better, if, indeed, your last state be not worse than your first.I have in my mind's eye even now a lieutenant who commanded a gunboat in
which I served as medical officer in charge.This little man was what
is called a sea-lawyer--my naval readers well know what I mean; he knew
all the Admiralty Instructions, was an amateur engineer, only needed the
title of M.D.to make him a doctor, could quibble and quirk, and in fact
could prove by the Queen's Regulations that your soul, to say nothing of
your body, wasn't your own; that _you_ were a slave, and _he_ lord--god
of all he surveyed.he has gone to his account; he
will not require an advocate, he can speak for himself.Not many such
hath the service, I am happy to say.He was continually changing his
poor hard-worked sub-lieutenants, and driving his engineers to drink,
previously to trying them by court-martial.At first he and I got on
very well; apparently he "loved me like a vera brither;" but we did not
continue long "on the same platform," and, from the day we had the first
difference of opinion, he was my foe, and a bitter one too.I assure
you, reader, it gave me a poor idea of the service, for it was my first
year.He was always on the outlook for faults, and his kindest words to
me were "chaffing" me on my accent, or about my country.To be able to
meet him on his own ground I studied the Instructions day and night, and
tried to stick by them.Malingering was common on board; one or two whom I caught I turned to
duty: the men, knowing how matters stood between the commander and me,
refused to work, and so I was had up and bullied on the quarter-deck for
"neglect of duty" in not putting these fellows on the sick-list.After
this I had to put every one that asked on the sick-list."Doctor," he would say to me on reporting the number sick, "this is
_wondrous_ strange--_thirteen_ on the list, out of only ninety men.Why, sir, I've been in line-of-battle ships,--_line-of-battle_ ships,
sir,--where they had not ten sick--_ten sick_, sir."This of course
implied an insult to me, but I was like a sheep before the shearers,
dumb.On Sunday mornings I went with him the round of inspection; the sick who
were able to be out of hammock were drawn up for review: had he been
half as particular with the men under his own charge or with the ship in
general as he was with the few sick, there would have been but little
disease to treat.Instead of questioning _me_ concerning their
treatment, he interrogated the sick themselves, quarrelling with the
medicine given, and pooh-pooh-ing my diagnosis.Those in hammocks, who
most needed gentleness and comfort, he bullied, blamed for being ill,
and rendered generally uneasy.Remonstrance on my part was either taken
no notice of, or instantly checked.If men were reported by me for
being dirty, giving impudence, or disobeying orders, _he_ became their
advocate--an able one too--and _I_ had to retire, sorry I had spoken.But I would not tell the tenth part of what I had to suffer, because
such men as he are the _exception_, and because he is dead.A little
black baboon of a boy who attended on this lieutenant-commanding had one
day incurred his displeasure: "Bo'swain's mate," cried he, "take my boy
forward, hoist him on an ordinary seaman's back, and give him a
rope's-ending; and," turning to me, "Doctor, you'll go and attend my
boy's flogging."With a face like crimson I rushed
below to my cabin, and--how could I help it?--made a baby of myself for
once; all my pent-up feelings found vent in a long fit of crying.True, I might in this case have written a letter to the service about my
treatment; but, as it is not till after twelve months the
assistant-surgeon is confirmed, the commander's word would have been
taken before mine, and I probably dismissed without a court-martial.That probationary year I consider more than a grievance, it is a _cruel
injustice_.There is a regulation--of late more strictly enforced by a
circular--that every medical officer serving on board his own ship shall
have a cabin, and the choice--by rank--of cabin, and he is a fool if he
does not enforce it.But it sometimes happens that a sub-lieutenant
(who has no cabin) is promoted to lieutenant on a foreign station; he
will then rank above the assistant-surgeon, and perhaps, if there is no
spare cabin, the poor doctor will have to give up his, and take to a
sea-chest and hammock, throwing all his curiosities, however valuable,
overboard.It would be the duty of the captain in such a case to build
an additional cabin, and if he did not, or would not, a letter to the
admiral would make him.Does the combatant officer treat the medical officer with respect?Certainly, unless one or other of the two be a snob: in the one case the
respect is not worth having, in the other it can't be expected.In the military branch you shall find many officers belonging to the
best English families: these I need hardly say are for the most part
gentlemen, and gentle men.However, it is allowed in most messes that

  "The rank is but the guinea's stamp,
  A man's man for a' that;"

and I assure the candidate for a commission, that, if he is himself a
gentleman, he will find no want of admirers in the navy.But there are
some young doctors who enter the service, knowing their profession to be
sure, and how to hold a knife and fork--not a carving-fork though--but
knowing little else; yet even these soon settle down, and, if they are
not dismissed by court-martial for knocking some one down at cards, or
on the quarter-deck, turn out good service-officers.Indeed, after all,
I question if it be good to know too much of fine-gentility on entering
the service, for, although the navy officers one meets have much that is
agreeable, honest, and true, there is through it all a vein of what can
only be designated as the coarse.The science of conversation, that
beautiful science that says and lets say, that can listen as well as
speak, is but little studied.Mostly all the talk is "shop," or rather
"ship."There is a want of tone in the discourse, a lack of refinement.The delicious chit-chat on new books, authors, poetry, music, or the
drama, interspersed with anecdote, incident, and adventure, and
enlivened with the laughter-raising pun or happy bon-mot, is, alas!but
too seldom heard: the rough joke, the tales of women, ships, and former
ship-mates, and the old, old, stale "good things,"--these are more
fashionable at our navy mess-board.Those who would object to such
conversation are in the minority, and prefer to let things hang as they
grew.Now, only one thing can ever alter this, and that is a good and
perfect library in every ship, to enable officers, who spend most of
their time out of society, to keep up with the times if possible.But I
fear I am drifting imperceptibly into the subject of navy-reform, which
I prefer leaving to older and wiser heads.Combatant (from combat, a battle), fighting officers,--as if
the medical offices didn't fight likewise.It would be better to take
away the "combat," and leave the "ant"--ant-officers, as they do the
work of the ship.There is one grievance which the medical officers, in common with their
combatant brethren, have to complain of--I refer to _compulsory
shaving_; neither is this by any means so insignificant a matter as it
may seem.It may appear a ridiculous statement, but it is nevertheless
a true one, that this regulation has caused many a young surgeon to
prefer the army to the navy."Mere dandies," the reader may say, "whom
this grievance would affect;" but there is many a good man a dandy, and
no one could surely respect a man who was careless of his personal
appearance, or who would willingly, and without a sigh, disfigure his
face by depriving it of what nature considers both ornate and useful--
ornate, as the ladies and the looking-glass can prove; and useful, as
the blistered chin and upper lip of the shaven sailor, in hot climates,
points out.From the earliest ages the moustache has been worn,--even
the Arabs, who shave the head, leave untouched the upper lip.What
would the pictures of some of the great masters be without it?Didn't
the Roman youths dedicate the first few downy hairs of the coming
moustache to the gods?Does not the moustache give a manly appearance
to the smallest and most effeminate?Does it not even beget a certain
amount of respect for the wearer?What sort of guys would the razor
make of Count Bismark, Dickens, the Sultan of Turkey, or Anthony
Trollope?Were the Emperor Napoleon deprived of his well-waxed
moustache, it might lose him the throne of France.Were Garibaldi to
call on his barber, he might thereafter call in vain for volunteers, and
English ladies would send him no more splints nor sticking-plaster.Shave Tennyson, and you may put him in petticoats as soon as you please.As to the moustache movement in the navy, it is a subject of talk--
admitting of no discussion--in every mess in the service, and thousands
are the advocates in favour of its adoption.Indeed, the arguments in
favour of it are so numerous, that it is a difficult matter to choose
the best, while the reasons against it are few, foolish, and despotic.At the time when the Lords of the Admiralty gave orders that the navy
should keep its upper lip, and three fingers' breadth of its royal chin,
smooth and copper-kettlish, it was neither fashionable nor respectable
to wear the moustache in good society.Those were the days of
cabbage-leaf cheeks, powdered wigs, and long queues; but those times are
past and gone from every corner of England's possessions save the navy.Barberism has been hunted from polite circles, but has taken refuge
under the trident of old Neptune; and, in these days of comparative
peace, more blood in the Royal Navy is drawn by the razor than by the
cutlass.In our little gunboat on the coast of Africa, we, both officers and men,
used, under the rose, to cultivate moustache and whiskers, until we fell
in with the ship of the commodore of the station.Then, when the
commander gave the order, "All hands to shave," never was such a
hurlyburly seen, such racing hither and thither (for not a moment was to
be lost), such sharpening of scissors and furbishing up of rusty razors.On one occasion I remember sending our steward, who was lathering his
face with a blacking-brush, and trying to scrape with a carving-knife,
to borrow the commander's razor; in the mean time the commander had
despatched his soapy-faced servant to beg the loan of mine.Both
stewards met with a clash, nearly running each other through the body
with their shaving gear.I lent the commander a Syme's bistoury, with
which he managed to pluck most of the hairs out by the root, as if he
meant to transplant them again, while I myself shaved with an amputating
knife.The men forward stuck by the scissors; and when the commander,
with bloody chin and watery eyes, asked why they did not shave,--"Why,
sir," replied the bo'swain's mate, "the cockroaches have been and gone
and eaten all our razors, they has, sir."Then, had you seen us reappear on deck after the terrible operation,
with our white shaven lips and shivering chins, and a foolish grin on
every face, you would, but for our uniform, have taken us for tailors on
strike, so unlike were we to the brave-looking, manly dare-devils that
trod the deck only an hour before.And if army officers and men have been graciously permitted to wear the
moustache since the Crimean war, why are not we?But perhaps the navy
took no part in that gallant struggle.But if we _must_ continue to do
penance by shaving, why should it not be the crown of the head, or any
other place, rather than the upper lip, which every one can see?One item of duty there is, which occasionally devolves on the medical
officer, and for the most part goes greatly against the feelings of the
_young_ surgeon; I refer to his compulsory attendance at floggings.It
is only fair to state that the majority of captains and commanders use
the cat as seldom as possible, and that, too, only sparingly.In some
ships, however, flogging is nearly as frequent as prayers of a morning.Again, it is more common on foreign stations than at home, and boys of
the first or second class, marines, and ordinary seamen, are for the
most part the victims.I do not believe I shall ever forget the first exhibition of this sort I
attended on board my own ship; not that the spectacle was in any way
more revolting than scores I have since witnessed, but because the sight
was new to me.I remember it wanted fully twenty minutes of seven in the morning, when
my servant aroused me."A flaying match, you know, sir," said Jones.My heart gave an anxious "thud" against my ribs, as if I myself were to
form the "ram for the sacrifice."I hurried through with my bath, and,
dressing myself as if for a holiday, in cocked hat, sword, and undress
coat, I went on deck.All the
minutiae of the scene I remember as though it were but yesterday,
morning was cool and clear, the hills clad in lilac and green, seabirds
floating high in air, and the waters of the bay reflecting the line of
the sky and the lofty mountain-sides, forming a picture almost dreamlike
in its quietness and serenity.The men were standing about in groups,
dressed in their whitest of pantaloons, bluest of smocks, and neatest of
black silk neckerchiefs.By-and-bye the culprit was led aft by a file
of marines, and I went below with him to make the preliminary
examination, in order to report whether or not he might be fit for the
punishment.He was as good a specimen of the British marine as one could wish to
look upon, hardy, bold, and wiry.His crime had been smuggling spirits
on board."Needn't examine me, Doctor," said he; "I ain't afeard of their four
dozen; they can't hurt me, sir,--leastways my back you know--my breast
though; hum-m!"and he shook his head, rather sadly I thought, as he
bent down his eyes."What," said I, "have you anything the matter with your chest?""Nay, Doctor, nay; its my feelins they'll hurt.I've a little girl at
home that loves me, and--bless you, sir, I won't look her in the face
again no-how."No lack of strength there, no nervousness; the artery
had the firm beat of health, the tendons felt like rods of iron beneath
the finger, and his biceps stood out hard and round as the mainstay of
an old seventy-four.I pitied the brave fellow, and--very wrong of me it was, but I could not
help it--filled out and offered him a large glass of rum.sir," he said, with a wistful eye on the ruby liquid, "don't tempt
me, sir.I can bear the bit o' flaying athout that: I wouldn't have my
messmates smell Dutch courage on my breath, sir; thankee all the same,
Doctor."All hands had already assembled, the men and boys on one side, and the
officers, in cocked hats and swords, on the other.A grating had been
lashed against the bulwark, and another placed on deck beside it.The
culprit's shoulders and back were bared, and a strong belt fastened
around the lower part of the loins for protection; he was then firmly
tied by the hands to the upper, and by the feet to the lower grating; a
little basin of cold water was placed at his feet; and all was now
prepared.The sentence was read, and orders given to proceed with the
punishment.The cat is a terrible instrument of torture; I would not
use it on a bull unless in self-defence: the shaft is about a foot and a
half long, and covered with green or red baize according to taste; the
thongs are nine, about twenty-eight inches in length, of the thickness
of a goose-quill, and with two knots tied on each.Men describe the
first blow as like a shower of molten lead.Combing out the thongs with his five fingers before each blow, firmly
and determinedly was the first dozen delivered by the bo'swain's mate,
and as unflinchingly received.Then, "One dozen, sir, please," he reported, saluting the commander."Continue the punishment," was the calm reply.Another dozen reported; again, the same reply.The flesh, like burning steel, had changed from red to
purple, and blue, and white; and between the third and fourth dozen, the
suffering wretch, pale enough now, and in all probability sick, begged a
comrade to give him a mouthful of water.There was a tear in the eye of
the hardy sailor who obeyed him, whispering as he did so--

"Keep up, Bill; it'll soon be over now.""Five, six," the corporal slowly counted--"seven, eight."It is the
last dozen, and how acute must be the torture!The blood
comes now fast enough, and--yes, gentle reader, I _will_ spare your
feelings.The man was cast loose at last and put on the sick-list; he
had borne his punishment without a groan and without moving a muscle.A
large pet monkey sat crunching nuts in the rigging, and grinning all the
time; I have no doubt _he_ enjoyed the spectacle immensely, _for he was
only an ape_.Tommie G--was a pretty, fair-skinned, blue-eyed boy, some sixteen
summers old.He was one of a class only too common in the service;
having become enamoured of the sea, he had run away from his home and
joined the service; and, poor little man!he found out, when too late,
that the stern realities of a sailor's life did not at all accord with
the golden notions he had formed of it.Being fond of stowing himself
away in corners with a book, instead of keeping his watch, Tommie very
often got into disgrace, spent much of his time at the mast-head, and
had many unpleasant palmar rencounters with the corporal's cane.One
day, his watch being over, he had retired to a corner with his little
"ditty-box."Nobody ever knew one-half of the beloved nicknacks and valued nothings
he kept in that wee box: it was in fact his private cabin, his sanctum
sanctorum, to which he could retreat when anything vexed him; a sort of
portable home, in which he could forget the toils of his weary watch,
the giddy mast-head, or even the corporal's cane.He had extracted, and
was dreamily gazing on, the portrait of a very young lady, when the
corporal came up and rudely seized it, and made a very rough and
inelegant remark concerning the fair virgin."That is my sister," cried Tommie, with tears in his eyes.sneered the corporal; "she is a--" and he added a word
that cannot be named.There was the spirit of young England, however,
in Tommie's breast; and the word had scarcely crossed the corporal's
lips, when those lips, and his nose too, were dyed in the blood the
boy's fist had drawn.For that blow poor Tommie was condemned to
receive four dozen lashes.And the execution of the sentence was
carried out with all the pomp and show usual on such occasions.Arrayed
in cooked-hats, epaulets, and swords, we all assembled to witness that
helpless child in his agony.One would have thought that even the rough
bo'swain's mate would have hesitated to disfigure skin so white and
tender, or that the frightened and imploring glance Tommie cast upward
on the first descending lash would have unnerved his arm.No,
reader; pity there doubtless was among us, but mercy--none.And the poor boy writhed in his agony; his screams and
cries were heartrending; and, God forgive us!we knew not till then he
was an orphan, till we heard him beseech his mother in heaven to look
down on her son, to pity and support him.well, perhaps she did,
for scarcely had the third dozen commenced when Tommie's cries were
hushed, his head drooped on his shoulder like a little dead bird's, and
for a while his sufferings were at an end.I gladly took the
opportunity to report further proceedings as dangerous, and he was
carried away to his hammock.I will not shock the nerves and feelings of the reader by any further
relation of the horrors of flogging, merely adding, that I consider
corporal punishment, as applied to men, _cowardly, cruel_, and debasing
to human nature; and as applied to boys, _brutal_, and sometimes even
_fiendish_.There is only one question I wish to ask of every
true-hearted English lady who may read these lines--Be you sister, wife,
or mother, could you in your heart have respected the commander who,
with folded arms and grim smile, replied to poor Tommie's frantic
appeals for mercy, "Continue the punishment"?The pay of medical officers is by no means high enough to entice young
doctors, who can do anything like well on shore, to enter the service.Ten shillings a day, with an increase of half-a-crown after five years'
service on full pay, is not a great temptation certainly.To be sure
the expenses of living are small, two shillings a day being all that is
paid for messing; this of course not including the wine-bill, the size
of which will depend on the "drouthiness" of the officer who contracts
it.Government provides all mess-traps, except silver forks and spoons.Then there is uniform to keep up, and shore-going clothes to be paid
for, and occasionally a shilling or two for boat-hire.However, with a
moderate wine-bill, the assistant-surgeon may save about four shillings
or more a day.Promotion to the rank of surgeon, unless to some fortunate individuals,
comes but slowly; it may, however, be reckoned on after from eight to
ten years.A few gentlemen out of each "batch" who "pass" into the
service, and who have distinguished themselves at the examination, are
promoted sooner.It seems to be the policy of the present Director-General to deal as
fairly as possible with every assistant-surgeon, after a certain
routine.On first joining he is sent for a short spell--too short,
indeed--to a hospital.He is then appointed to a sea-going ship for a
commission--say three years--on a foreign station.On coming home he is
granted a few months' leave on full pay, and is afterwards appointed to
a harbour-ship for about six months.By the end of this time he is
supposed to have fairly recruited from the fatigues of his commission
abroad; he is accordingly sent out again to some other foreign station
for three or four years.On again returning to his native land, he
might be justified in hoping for a pet appointment, say to a hospital,
the marines, a harbour-ship, or, failing these, to the Channel fleet.On being promoted he is sent off abroad again, and so on; and thus he
spends his useful life, and serves his Queen and country, and earns his
pay, and generally spends that likewise.Pensions are granted to the widows of assistant-surgeons--from forty to
seventy pounds a year, according to circumstances; and if he leaves no
widow, a dependent mother, or even sister, may obtain the pension.But
I fear I must give, to assistant-surgeons about to many, Punch's advice,
and say most emphatically, "Don't;" unless, indeed, the dear creature
has money, and is able to purchase a practice for her darling doctor.With a little increase of pay ungrudgingly given, shorter commissions
abroad, and less of the "bite and buffet" about favours granted, the
navy would be a very good service for the medical officer.However, as it is, to a man who has neither wife nor riches, it is, I
dare say, as good a way of spending life as any other; and I do think
that there are but few old surgeons who, on looking back to the life
they have led in the navy, would not say of that service,--"With all thy
faults I love thee still."EMIL GRELIEU

Oh, my poor head, it is so weak--

MAURICE

_Going over to him._

Forgive me, father, I'll not do it any more.I was foolishly
excited, but do you know I could not endure it.May I have a
cup, mamma?JEANNE

Yes, this is yours.MAURICE

Yes, I do.EMIL GRELIEU

I am feeling perfectly well today, Jeanne.When is the bandage
to be changed?Count Clairmont will bring his surgeon along with him.MAURICE

Who is that, mamma?JEANNE

You'll see him.But, please, Maurice, when you see him, don't
open your mouth so wide.You have a habit--you open your mouth
and then you forget about it.MAURICE

_Blushing._

You are both looking at me and smiling._The sound of automobiles is heard._

JEANNE

_Rising quickly._

I think they are here.Maurice, this is only Count Clairmont,
don't forget.They will speak with you
about a very, very important matter, Emil, but you must not be
agitated.EMIL GRELIEU

Yes, I know.JEANNE

_Kissing him quickly._

I am going._Exit, almost colliding with Silvina, who is excited._

MAURICE

_Whispering._

Who is it, Silvina?_Silvina makes some answer in mingled delight and awe.Maurice's
face assumes the same expression as Silvina's.Maurice walks quickly to the window and raises his left hand to
his forehead, straightening himself in military fashion.Thus he
stands until the others notice him._

_Enter Jeanne, Count Clairmont, followed by Secretary Lagard and
the Count's adjudant, an elderly General of stem appearance,
with numerous decorations upon his chest.The Count himself
is tall, well built and young, in a modest officer's uniform,
without any medals to signify his high station.He carries
himself very modestly, almost bashfully, but overcoming his
first uneasiness, he speaks warmly and powerfully and freely.All treat him with profound respect._

_Lagard is a strong old man with a leonine gray head.He speaks
simply, his gestures are calm and resolute.It is evident that
he is in the habit of speaking from a platform._

_Jeanne holds a large bouquet of flowers in her hands.Count
Clairmont walks directly toward Grelieu's bedside._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Confused._

I have come to shake hands with you, my dear master.Oh, but
do not make a single unnecessary movement, not a single one,
otherwise I shall be very unhappy!EMIL GRELIEU

I am deeply moved, I am happy.COUNT CLAIRMONT

No, no, don't speak that way.Here stands before you only a man
who has learned to think from your books.But see what they have
done to you--look, Lagard!LAGARD

How are you, Grelieu?I, too, want to shake your hand.Today I
am a Secretary by the will of Fate, but yesterday I was only a
physician, and I may congratulate you--you have a kind hand.GENERAL

_Coming forward modestly._

Allow me, too, in the name of this entire army of ours to
express to you our admiration, Monsieur Grelieu!EMIL GRELIEU

I thank you.COUNT CLAIRMONT

But perhaps it is necessary to have a surgeon?JEANNE

He can listen and talk, Count.COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Noticing Maurice, confused._

Oh!Please put down your hand--you are wounded.MAURICE

I am so happy, Count.JEANNE

This is our second son.Our first son, Pierre, was killed at
Liège--

COUNT CLAIRMONT

I dare not console you, Madame Grelieu.Give me your hand,
Maurice.I dare not--

COUNT CLAIRMONT

My dear young man, I, too, am nothing but a soldier now.My children and my wife
have sent you flowers--but where are they?JEANNE

Here they are, Count.COUNT CLAIRMONT

Thank you.But I did not know that your flowers were better than
mine, for my flowers smell of smoke._To Count Clairmont._

His pulse is good.Grelieu, we have come to you not only to
express our sympathy.Through me all the working people of
Belgium are shaking your hand.EMIL GRELIEU

I am proud of it, Lagard.LAGARD

But we are just as proud.Yes; there is something we must
discuss with you.Count Clairmont did not wish to disturb you,
but I said: "Let him die, but before that we must speak to him."EMIL GRELIEU

I am not dying.Maurice, I think you had better go out.COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Quickly._

Oh, no, no.He is your son, Grelieu, and he should be present to
hear what his father will say.Oh, I should have been proud to
have such a father.LAGARD

Our Count is a very fine young man--Pardon me, Count, I have
again upset our--

COUNT CLAIRMONT

That's nothing, I have already grown accustomed to it.Master,
it is necessary for you and your family to leave for Antwerp
today.EMIL GRELIEU

Are our affairs in such a critical condition?LAGARD

What is there to tell?That
horde of Huns is coming upon us like the tide of the sea.Today
they are still there, but tomorrow they will flood your house,
Grelieu.To what can we resort
in our defence?On this side are they, and there is the sea.Only very little is left of Belgium, Grelieu.Very soon there
will be no room even for my beard here.Dull sounds of cannonading are heard in the distance.All turn their eyes to the window._

EMIL GRELIEU

Is that a battle?COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Listening, calmly._

No, that is only the beginning.But tomorrow they will carry
their devilish weapons past your house.Do you know they are
real iron monsters, under whose weight our earth is quaking
and groaning.They are moving slowly, like amphibia that have
crawled out at night from the abyss--but they are moving!Another few days will pass, and they will crawl over to Antwerp,
they will turn their jaws to the city, to the churches--Woe to
Belgium, master!LAGARD

Yes, it is very bad.We are an honest and peaceful people
despising bloodshed, for war is such a stupid affair!And we
should not have had a single soldier long ago were it not for
this accursed neighbor, this den of murderers.GENERAL

And what would we have done without any soldiers, Monsieur
Lagard?LAGARD

And what can we do with soldiers, Monsieur General?COUNT CLAIRMONT

You are wrong, Lagard.With our little army there is still one
possibility--to die as freemen die.But without an army we would
have been bootblacks, Lagard!LAGARD

_Grumbling._

Well, I would not clean anybody's boots.Things are in bad
shape, Grelieu, in very bad shape.And there is but one remedy
left for us--.EMIL GRELIEU

I know.EMIL GRELIEU

The dam._Jeanne and Emil shudder and look at each other with terror in
their eyes._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

You shuddered, you are shuddering, madame.But what am I to do,
what are we to do, we who dare not shudder?JEANNE

Oh, I simply thought of a girl who was trying to find her way to
Lonua.She will never find her way to Lonua.COUNT CLAIRMONT

But what is to be done?The Count steps away to the window
and looks out, nervously twitching his mustaches.Maurice has
moved aside and, as before, stands at attention.Jeanne stands
a little distance away from him, with her shoulder leaning
against the wall, her beautiful pale head thrown back.Lagard is
sitting at the bedside as before, stroking his gray, disheveled
beard.The General is absorbed in gloomy thoughts._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Turning around resolutely._

I am a peaceful man, but I can understand why people take up
arms.That means a sword, a gun, explosive contrivances.Fire is killing people, but at the same time it
also gives light.There is something of the
ancient sacrifice in it.cold, dark, silent, covering
with mire, causing bodies to swell--water, which was the
beginning of chaos; water, which is guarding the earth by day
and night in order to rush upon it.My friend, believe me, I am
quite a daring man, but I am afraid of water!Lagard, what would
you say to that?LAGARD

We Belgians have too long been struggling against the water not
to have learned to fear it.JEANNE

But what is more terrible, the Prussians or water?GENERAL

_Bowing._

Madame is right.The Prussians are not more terrible, but they
are worse.It is terrible to release water
from captivity, the beast from its den, nevertheless it is a
better friend to us than the Prussians.I would prefer to see
the whole of Belgium covered with water rather than extend a
hand of reconciliation to a scoundrel!Neither they nor we shall
live to see that, even if the entire Atlantic Ocean rush over
our heads._Brief pause._

GENERAL

But I hope that we shall not come to that.Meanwhile it is
necessary for us to flood only part of our territory.JEANNE

_Her eyes closed, her head hanging down._

And what is to be done with those who could not abandon their
homes, who are deaf, who are sick and alone?_Silence._

JEANNE

There in the fields and in the ditches are the wounded.There
the shadows of people are wandering about, but in their veins
there is still warm blood.Oh, don't
look at me like that, Emil; you had better not listen to what I
am saying.I have spoken so only because my heart is wrung with
pain--it isn't necessary to listen to me at all, Count._Count Clairmont walks over to Grelieu's bed quickly and firmly.At first he speaks confusedly, seeking the right word; then he
speaks ever more boldly and firmly._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

My dear and honored master!We would not have dared to take
from you even a drop of your health, if--if it were not for the
assurance that serving your people may give new strength to your
heroic soul!Yesterday, it was resolved at our council to break
the dams and flood part of our kingdom, but I could not, I dared
not, give my full consent before I knew what you had to say to
this plan.I did not sleep all night long, thinking--oh, how
terrible, how inexpressibly sad my thoughts were!We are the
body, we are the hands, we are the head--while you, Grelieu, you
are the conscience of our people.Blinded by the war, we may
unwillingly, unwittingly, altogether against our will, violate
man-made laws.We are driven to despair, we have no Belgium any longer,
it is trampled by our enemies, but in your breast, Emil Grelieu,
the heart of all Belgium is beating--and your answer will be the
answer of our tormented, blood-stained, unfortunate land!Maurice is crying, looking at his
father._

LAGARD

_Softly._

Bravo, Belgium!The sound of cannonading is heard._

JEANNE

_Softly, to Maurice._

Sit down, Maurice, it is hard for you to stand.MAURICE

Oh, mamma!I am so happy to stand here now--

LAGARD

Now I shall add a few words.As you know, Grelieu, I am a man of
the people.I know the price the people pay for their hard work.I know the cost of all these gardens, orchards and factories
which we shall bury under the water.They have cost us sweat
and health and tears, Grelieu.These are our sufferings which
will be transformed into joy for our children.But as a nation
that loves and respects liberty above its sweat and blood and
tears--as a nation, I say, I would prefer that sea waves should
seethe here over our heads rather than that we should have to
black the boots of the Prussians.And if nothing but islands
remain of Belgium they will be known as "honest islands," and
the islanders will be Belgians as before._All are agitated._

EMIL GRELIEU

And what do the engineers say?GENERAL

_Respectfully waiting for the Count's answer._

Monsieur Grelieu, they say this can be done in two hours.LAGARD

_Grumbles._

In two hours!How many years have we been building
it!GENERAL

The engineers were crying when they said it, Monsieur.LAGARD

The engineers were crying?_Suddenly he bursts into sobs, and slowly takes a handkerchief
from his pocket._

COUNT CLAIRMONT

We are awaiting your answer impatiently, Grelieu.You are
charged with a grave responsibility to your fatherland--to lift
your hand against your own fatherland.EMIL GRELIEU Have we no other defence?Lagard dries
his eyes and slowly answers with a sigh_.JEANNE

_Shaking her head._

No.COUNT CLAIRMONT

_Rapidly._

We must gain time, Grelieu.By the power of all our lives,
thrown in the fields, we cannot stop them._Stamping his foot._

Time, time!We must steal from fate a small part of eternity--a
few days, a week!The Russians are
coming to us from the East.The German steel has already
penetrated to the heart of the French land--and infuriated with
pain, the French eagle is rising over the Germans' bayonets
and is coming toward us!The noble knights of the sea--the
British--are already rushing toward us, and to Belgium are their
powerful arms stretched out over the abyss.Belgium is praying for a few days, for
a few hours!You have already given to Belgium your blood,
Grelieu, and you have the right to lift your hand against your
blood-stained fatherland!_Brief pause._

EMIL GRELIEU

We must break the dams._Curtain_



SCENE V


_Night.A sentinel
on guard at the door leading to the rooms occupied by the
Commander of the army.Two officers on duty are
talking lazily, suffering apparently from the heat.Only from time to time the measured footsteps of
pickets are heard, and muffled voices and angry exclamations._

VON RITZAU

Do you feel sleepy, von Stein?VON STEIN

I don't feel sleepy, but I feel like smoking.RITZAU

A bad habit!STEIN

But what if _he_ should come in?Not a breath of pure air enters the lungs.The air is poisoned with the smell of smoke.We must invent
something against this obnoxious odor.RITZAU

I am not an inventor.First of all it is necessary to wring out
the air as they wring the clothes they wash, and dry it in the
sun.It is so moist, I feel as though I were diving in it.Do
you know whether _he_ is in a good mood today?STEIN

Why, is he subject to moods, good or bad?RITZAU

Great self-restraint!STEIN

Have you ever seen him undressed--or half-dressed?Or have you
ever seen his hair in disorder?RITZAU

He speaks so devilishly little, Stein.STEIN

He prefers to have his cannon speak.It is quite a powerful
voice, isn't it, Ritzau?A tall, handsome officer enters quickly and
goes toward the door leading to the room of the Commander._

Blumenfeld!_The tall officer waves his hand and opens the door cautiously,
ready to make his bow._

He is malting his career!RITZAU

He is a good fellow.STEIN

Would you rather be in Paris?RITZAU

I would prefer any less unbearable country to this.How dull it
must be here in the winter time.STEIN

But we have saved them from dullness for a long time to come.Were you ever in the Montmartre cafés, Ritzau?STEIN

Doesn't one find there a wonderful refinement, culture and
innate elegance?Unfortunately, our Berlin people are far
different.RITZAU

Oh, of course._The tall officer comes out of the door, stepping backward.He
heaves a sigh of relief and sits down near the two officers.Takes out a cigar._

VON BLUMENFELD How are things?STEIN

Then I am going to smoke too.BLUMENFELD

You may smoke.He is not coming out Do you want to hear
important news?BLUMENFELD He laughed just now I

STEIN

Really!BLUMENFELD

Upon my word of honor!And he touched my shoulder with two
fingers--do you understand?STEIN

_With envy._

Of course!I suppose you brought him good news, Blumenfeld?_The military telegraphist, standing at attention, hands
Blumenfeld a folded paper._

TELEGRAPHIST

A radiogram, Lieutenant!BLUMENFELD

Let me have it._Slowly he puts his cigar on the window sill and enters the
Commander's room cautiously._

STEIN

He's a lucky fellow.You may say what you please about luck,
but it exists.Von?--Did you know his
father?RITZAU

I have reason to believe that he had no grandfather at all._Blumenfeld comes out and rejoins the two officers, taking up
his cigar._

STEIN

Another military secret?BLUMENFELD

Of course.Everything that is said and done here is a military
secret.The information we have
received concerns our new siege guns--they are advancing
successfully.BLUMENFELD

Yes, successfully.They have just passed the most difficult part
of the road--you know where the swamps are--

STEIN

Oh, yes.BLUMENFELD

The road could not support the heavy weight and caved in.He ordered a report about the
movement at each and every kilometer.STEIN

Now he will sleep in peace.BLUMENFELD

He never sleeps, von Stein.BLUMENFELD

He never sleeps, von Stein!When he is not listening to
reports or issuing commands, he is thinking.As the personal
correspondent of his Highness I have the honor to know many
things which others are not allowed to know--Oh, gentlemen, he
has a wonderful mind!_Another very young officer enters, stands at attention before
Blumenfeld._

BLUMENFELD

Sit down, von Schauss.BLUMENFELD

He has a German philosophical mind which manages guns as
Leibnitz managed ideas.Everything is preconceived, everything
is prearranged, the movement of our millions of people has been
elaborated into such a remarkable system that Kant himself
would have been proud of it.Gentlemen, we are led forward by
indomitable logic and by an iron will._The officers express their approval by subdued exclamations of
"bravo."_

BLUMENFELD

How can he sleep, if the movement of our armies is but the
movement of parts of his brains!And what is the use of sleep
in general?I sleep very little myself, and I advise you,
gentlemen, not to indulge in foolish sleep.RITZAU

But our human organism requires sleep.BLUMENFELD

Nonsense!Organism--that is something invented by the doctors
who are looking for practice among the fools.I know only my desires and my will, which says:
"Gerhardt, do this!SCHAUSS

Will you permit me to take down your words in my notebook?BLUMENFELD

Please, Schauss._The telegraphist has entered._

ZIGLER

I really don't know, but something strange has happened.It
seems that we are being interfered with, I can't understand
anything.BLUMENFELD

What is it?ZIGLER

We can make out one word, "Water"--but after that all is
incomprehensible.And then again, "Water"--

BLUMENFELD

What water?ZIGLER

He is also surprised and cannot understand.BLUMENFELD

You are a donkey, Zigler!We'll have to call out--

_The Commander comes out.His voice is dry and unimpassioned._

COMMANDER

Blumenfeld!_All jump up, straighten themselves, as if petrified._

What is this?BLUMENFELD

I have not yet investigated it, your Highness.Zigler is
reporting--

COMMANDER

What is it, Zigler?ZIGLER

Your Highness, we are being interfered with.I don't know what
it is, but I can't understand anything.We have been able to
make out only one word--"Water."COMMANDER

_Turning around._

See what it is, Blumenfeld, and report to me--

_Engineer runs in._

ENGINEER

Where is Blumenfeld?COMMANDER

_Pausing._

What has happened there, Kloetz?ENGINEER

They don't respond to our calls, your Highness.COMMANDER

You think something serious has happened?ENGINEER

I dare not think so, your Highness, but I am alarmed.Silence is
the only answer to our most energetic calls._The second telegraphist has entered quietly._

GREITZER

They are silent, your Highness._Brief pause._

COMMANDER

_Again turning to the door._

Please investigate this, Lieutenant._He advances a step to the door, then stops.There is a
commotion behind the windows--a noise and the sound of voices.The noise keeps
growing, turning at times into a loud roar._

What is that?An officer, bareheaded, rushes in
excitedly, his hair disheveled, his face pale._

OFFICER

I want to see his Highness.BLUMENFELD

_Hissing._

You are insane!COMMANDER

Calm yourself, officer.I have the honor to report to you that the
Belgians have burst the dams, and our armies are flooded._With horror._

We must hurry, your Highness!OFFICER

They are flooded, your Highness.COMMANDER

Compose yourself, you are not behaving properly!I am asking you
about our field guns--

OFFICER

They are flooded, your Highness.We must hurry, your Highness, we are in a valley.They have broken the dams; and the water is
rushing this way violently.It is only five kilometers away from
here--and we can hardly--.The beginning of a terrible panic is felt,
embracing the entire camp.All watch impatiently the reddening
face of the Commander._

COMMANDER

But this is--

_He strikes the table with his fist forcibly._

Absurd!_He looks at them with cold fury, but all lower their eyes.The
frightened officer is trembling and gazing at the window.The
lights grow brighter outside--it is evident that a building has
been set on fire.A
dull noise, then the crash of shots is heard.The discipline is
disappearing gradually._

BLUMENFELD

They have gone mad!STEIN

But that can't be the Belgians!RITZAU

They may have availed themselves--

BLUMENFELD

Aren't you ashamed, Stein?I beg of you--

_Suddenly a piercing, wild sound of a horn is heard ordering to
retreat.The roaring sound is growing rapidly._

COMMANDER

_Shots._

Who has commanded to retreat?_Blumenfeld lowers his head._

COMMANDER

This is not the German Army!You are unworthy of being called
soldiers!BLUMENFELD

_Stepping forward, with dignity._

Your Highness!We are not fishes to swim in the water!_Runs out, followed by two or three others.The panic is
growing._

BLUMENFELD

Your Highness!Your life is in danger--your
Highness.Only the
sentinel remains in the position of one petrified._

BLUMENFELD

Your Highness!Your life--I am afraid that
another minute, and it will be too late!COMMANDER

But this is--

_Again strikes the table with his fist._

But this is absurd, Blumenfeld!_Curtain_



SCENE VI


_The same hour of night.In the darkness it is difficult to
discern the silhouettes of the ruined buildings and of the
trees.At the right, a half-destroyed bridge.From time to time the German flashlights are
seen across the dark sky.Near the bridge, an automobile in
which the wounded Emil Grelieu and his son are being carried to
Antwerp.Jeanne and a young physician are with them.Something
has broken down in the automobile and a soldier-chauffeur is
bustling about with a lantern trying to repair it.Langloi
stands near him._


DOCTOR

_Uneasily._

Well?CHAUFFEUR

_Examining._

I don't know yet.DOCTOR

Is it a serious break?CHAUFFEUR

No--I don't know.MAURICE

_From the automobile._

What is it, Doctor?CHAUFFEUR

_Angrily._

We'll start!DOCTOR

I don't know.MAURICE

Shall we stay here long?DOCTOR

_To the chauffeur._

Shall we stay here long?CHAUFFEUR

_Angrily._

How do I know?_Hands the lantern to the doctor._

MAURICE

Then I will come out.JEANNE

You had better stay here, Maurice.MAURICE

No, mother, I am careful._Jumps off and watches the chauffeur at work._

MAURICE

How unfortunate that we are stuck here!CHAUFFEUR

_Grumbling._

A bridge!DOCTOR

Yes, it is unfortunate.MAURICE

_Shrugging his shoulders._

Father did not want to leave.Mamina, do
you think our people are already in Antwerp?JEANNE

Yes, I think so.EMIL GRELIEU

No.It is very pleasant to breathe the fresh air.DOCTOR

_To Maurice._

I think we are still in the region which--

MAURICE

Yes.DOCTOR

_Looking at his watch._

Twenty--a quarter of ten.MAURICE

Then it is a quarter of an hour since the bursting of the dams.Mamma, do you hear, it is a quarter of ten now!JEANNE

Yes, I hear.MAURICE

But it is strange that we haven't heard any explosions.DOCTOR

How can you say that, Monsieur Maurice?MAURICE

I thought that such explosions would be heard a hundred
kilometers away.Our house and our
garden will soon be flooded!I wonder how high the water will
rise.Do you think it will reach up to the second story?CHAUFFEUR

_Grumbling._

I am working.Mamma, see how the searchlights are working.EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne, lift me a little.JEANNE

My dear, I don't know whether I am allowed to do it.DOCTOR

You may lift him a little, if it isn't very painful.JEANNE

Do you feel any pain?EMIL GRELIEU

No.MAURICE

Father, they are flashing the searchlights across the sky like
madmen._A bluish light is flashed over them, faintly illuminating the
whole group._

MAURICE

Right into my eyes!EMIL GRELIEU

I suppose so.Either they have been warned, or the water is
reaching them by this time.JEANNE

Do you think so, Emil?EMIL GRELIEU

Yes.It seems to me that I hear the sound of the water from that
side._All listen and look in the direction from which the noise came._

DOCTOR

_Uneasily._

How unpleasant this is!MAURICE

Father, it seems to me I hear voices.Listen--it sounds as
though they are crying there.Father, the
Prussians are crying._A distant, dull roaring of a crowd is heard.The searchlights are
swaying from side to side._

EMIL GRELIEU

It is they.DOCTOR

If we don't start in a quarter of an hour--

EMIL GRELIEU

In half an hour, Doctor.MAURICE

Father, how beautiful and how terrible it is!JEANNE

What is it?MAURICE

I want to kiss it.JEANNE

What a foolish little boy you are, Maurice.MAURICE

Monsieur Langloi said that in three days from now I may remove
my bandage.Just think of it, in three days I shall be able to
take up my gun again!...The
chauffeur and the doctor draw their revolvers.A figure appears
from the field, approaching from one of the ditches.A peasant,
wounded in the leg, comes up slowly, leaning upon a cane._

MAURICE

Who is there?PEASANT

Our own, our own.MAURICE

Yes, we're going to the city.Our car has broken down, we're
repairing it.PEASANT

What am I doing here?They also look at him
attentively, by the light of the lantern._

CHAUFFEUR

Give me the light!PEASANT

Are you carrying a wounded man?I
cannot walk, it is very hard.I lay there in the ditch and when I heard you
speak French I crawled out.DOCTOR

How were you wounded?PEASANT

I was walking in the field and they shot me.They must have
thought I was a rabbit._Laughs hoarsely._

They must have thought I was a rabbit.What is the news,
gentlemen?MAURICE

Don't you know?PEASANT

What can I know?I lay there and looked at the sky--that's all I
know.Just look at it, I have been watching
it all the time.What is that I see in the sky, eh?EMIL GRELIEU

Sit down near us.MAURICE

Listen, sit down here.They are
crying there--the Prussians!They must have learned of
it by this time.Listen, it is so far, and yet we can hear!_The peasant laughs hoarsely._

MAURICE

Sit down, right here, the automobile is large.CHAUFFEUR

_Muttering._

Sit down, sit down!DOCTOR

_Uneasily._

What is it?MAURICE

What an unfortunate mishap!JEANNE

_Agitated._

They shot you like a rabbit?Do you hear, Emil--they thought a
rabbit was running!_She laughs loudly, the peasant also laughs._

PEASANT

I look like a rabbit!JEANNE

Do you hear, Emil?_Laughs._

EMIL GRELIEU

Jeanne!JEANNE

It makes me laugh--it seems so comical to me that they mistake
us for rabbits.And now, what are we now--water rats?Emil, just
picture to yourself, water rats in an automobile!JEANNE

No, no, I am not laughing any more, Maurice!_Laughs._

And what else are we?PEASANT

_Laughs._

And now we must hide in the ground--

JEANNE

_In the same tone._

     Government or Egyptian Government desire a settled state of
     affairs in Soudan after the evacuation?Do these Governments want
     to be free of this religious fanatic?If they do, then Zebehr
     should be sent; and if the two Governments are indifferent, then
     do not send him, and I have confidence one will (_D.V._) get out
     the Egyptian employes in three or four months, and will leave a
     cockpit behind us.It is not my duty to dictate what should be
     done.I will only say, first, I was justified in my action
     against Zebehr; second, that if Zebehr has no malice personally
     against me, I should take him at once as a humanly certain
     settler of the Mahdi and of those in revolt.I have written this
     Minute, and Zebehr's story may be heard.I only wish that after
     he has been interrogated, I may be questioned on such subjects as
     his statements are at variance with mine.I would wish this
     inquiry to be official, and in such a way that, whatever may be
     the decision come to, it may be come to in my absence."With respect to the slave-trade, I think nothing of it, for
     there will always be slave-trade as long as Turkey and Egypt buy
     the slaves, and it may be Zebehr will or might in his interest
     stop it in some manner.I will therefore sum up my opinion, viz.that I would willingly take the responsibility of taking Zebehr
     up with me if, after an interview with Sir E. Baring and Nubar
     Pasha, they tell 'the mystic feeling' I could trust him, and
     which'mystic feeling' I felt I had for him to-night when I met
     him at Cherif Pasha's house.Zebehr would have nothing to gain in
     hunting me, and I would have no fear.In this affair my desire, I
     own, would be to take Zebehr.I cannot exactly say why I feel
     towards him thus, and I feel sure that his going would settle the
     Soudan affair to the benefit of H.M.'s Government, and I would
     bear the responsibility of recommending it."C. G. GORDON, Major-General."An interview between Gordon and Zebehr was therefore arranged for 26th
January, the day after this memorandum was written.On 25th it should
also be remembered that the Khedive had again made Gordon
Governor-General of the Soudan.Besides the two principals, there were
present at this interview Sir Evelyn Baring, Sir Gerald Graham,
Colonel Watson, and Nubar Pasha.Zebehr protested his innocence of the
charges made against him; and when Gordon reminded him of his letter,
signed with his hand and bearing his seal, found in the divan of his
son Suleiman, he called upon Gordon to produce this letter, which, of
course, he could not do, because it was sent with the other
incriminating documents to the Khedive in 1879.The passage in that
letter establishing the guilt of Zebehr may, however, be cited, it
being first explained that Idris Ebter was Gordon's governor of the
Bahr Gazelle province, and that Suleiman did carry out his father's
instructions to attack him."Now since this same Idris Ebter has not appreciated our kindness
     towards him, nor shown regard for his duty towards God, therefore
     do you accomplish his ejection by compulsory force, threats, and
     menaces, without personal hurt, but with absolute expulsion and
     deprivation from the Bahr-el-Gazelle, leaving no remnant of him
     in that region, no son, and no relation.For he is a
     mischief-maker, and God loveth not them who make mischief."It is highly probable, from the air of confidence with which Zebehr
called for the production of the letter, that, either during the Arabi
rising or in some other way, he had recovered possession of the
original; but Gordon had had all the documents copied in 1879, and
bound in the little volume mentioned in the preceding Memorandum, as
well as in several of his letters, and the evidence as to Zebehr's
complicity and guilt seems quite conclusive.In his Memorandum Gordon makes two conditions: first, "if Zebehr bears
no malice personally against me, I will take him to the Soudan at
once," and this condition is given further force later on in reference
to "the mystic feeling."The second condition was that Zebehr was only
to be sent if the Government desired a settled state of affairs after
the evacuation.From the beginning of the interview it was clear to
those present that no good would come of it, as Zebehr could scarcely
control his feelings, and showed what they deemed a personal
resentment towards Gordon that at any moment might have found
expression in acts.After a brief discussion it was decided to adjourn
the meeting, on the pretence of having search made for the
incriminating document, but really to avert a worse scene.General
Graham, in the after-discussion on Gordon's renewed desire to take
Zebehr with him, declared that it would be dangerous to acquiesce; and
Colonel Watson plainly stated that it would mean the death of one or
both of them.Gordon, indifferent to all considerations of personal
danger, did not take the same view of Zebehr's attitude towards him
personally, and would still have taken him with him, if only on the
ground that he would be less dangerous in the Soudan than at Cairo;
but the authorities would not acquiesce in a proposition that they
considered would inevitably entail the murder of Gordon at an early
stage of the journey.They cannot, from any point of view, be greatly
blamed in this matter; and when Gordon complains later on, as he
frequently did complain, about the matter, the decision must be with
his friends at Cairo, for they strictly conformed with the first
condition specified in his own Memorandum.At the same time, he was
perfectly correct in his views as to Zebehr's power and capacity for
mischief, and it was certainly very unfortunate and wrong that his
earlier suggestion of removing him to Cyprus or some other place of
safety was not adopted.The following new correspondence will at least suggest a doubt whether
Gordon was not more correct in his view of Zebehr's attitude towards
himself than his friends.What they deemed strong resentment and a
bitter personal feeling towards Gordon on the part of Zebehr, he
considered merely the passing excitement from discussing a matter of
great moment and interest.He would still have taken Zebehr with him,
and for many weeks after his arrival at Khartoum he expected that, in
reply to his frequently reiterated messages, "Send me Zebehr," the
ex-Dictator of the Soudan would be sent up from Cairo.In one of the
last letters to his sister, dated Khartoum, 5th March 1884, he wrote:
"I hope _much_ from Zebehr's coming up, for he is so well known to all
up here."Some time after communications were broken off with Khartoum, Miss
Gordon wrote to Zebehr, begging him to use his influence with the
Mahdi to get letters for his family to and from General Gordon.To
that Zebehr replied as follows:--

     "TO HER EXCELLENCY MISS GORDON,--I am very grateful to you for
     having had the honour of receiving your letter of the 13th, and
     am very sorry to say that I am not able to write to the Mahdi,
     because he is new, and has appeared lately in the Soudan.I do
     not know him.He is not of my tribe nor of my relations, nor of
     the tribes with which I was on friendly terms; and for these
     reasons I do not see the way in which I could carry out your
     wish.I am ready to serve you in all that is possible all my life
     through, but please accept my excuse in this matter.ZEBEHR RAHAMAH, Pasha."CAIRO, _22nd January 1885_."Some time after the fall of Khartoum, Miss Gordon made a further
communication to Zebehr, but, owing to his having been exiled to
Gibraltar, it was not until October 1887 that she received the
following reply, which is certainly curious; and I believe that this
letter and personal conversations with Zebehr induced one of the
officers present at the interview on 26th January 1884 to change his
original opinion, and to conclude that it would have been safe for
General Gordon to have taken Zebehr with him:--

                              "CAIRO [_received by Miss Gordon
                                  about 12th October 1887_]."HONOURABLE LADY,--I most respectfully beg to acknowledge the
     receipt of your letter, enclosed to that addressed to me by His
     Excellency Watson Pasha."This letter has caused me a great satisfaction, as it speaks of
     the friendly relations that existed between me and the late
     Gordon Pasha, your brother, whom you have replaced in my heart,
     and this has been ascertained to me by your inquiring about me
     and your congratulating me for my return to Cairo" [that is,
     after his banishment to Gibraltar]."I consider that your poor brother is still alive in you, and for
     the whole run of my life I put myself at your disposal, and beg
     that you will count upon me as a true and faithful friend to you."You will also kindly pay my respects to the whole family of
     Gordon Pasha, and may you not deprive me of your good news at any
     time."My children and all my family join themselves to me, and pay you
     their best respects."Further, I beg to inform you that the messenger who had been
     previously sent through me, carrying Government correspondence to
     your brother, Gordon Pasha, has reached him, and remitted the
     letter he had in his own hands, and without the interference of
     any other person.The details of his history are mentioned in the
     enclosed report, which I hope you will kindly read.--Believe me,
     honourable Lady, to remain yours most faithfully,

                                             ZEBEHR RAHAMAH.""When I came to Cairo and resided in it as I was before, I kept
     myself aside of all political questions connected with the Soudan
     or others, according to the orders given me by the Government to
     that effect.But as a great rumour was spread over by the high
     Government officials who arrived from the Soudan, and were with
     H.E.General Gordon Pasha at Khartoum before and after it fell,
     that all my properties in that country had been looted, and my
     relations ill-treated, I have been bound, by a hearty feeling of
     compassion, to ask the above said officials what they knew about
     it, and whether the messenger sent by me with the despatches
     addressed by the Government to General Gordon Pasha had reached
     Khartoum and remitted what he had."These officials informed me verbally that on the 25th Ramadan
     1301 (March 1884), at the time they were sitting at Khartoum with
     General Gordon, my messenger, named Fadhalla Kabileblos, arrived
     there, and remitted to the General in his proper hands, and
     without the interference of anyone, all the despatches he had on
     him.After that the General expressed his greatest content for
     the receipt of the correspondence, and immediately gave orders to
     the artillery to fire twenty-five guns, in sign of rejoicing, and
     in order to show to the enemy his satisfaction for the news of
     the arrival of British troops.General Gordon then treated my
     messenger cordially, and requested the Government to pay him a
     sum of L500 on his return to Cairo, as a gratuity for all the
     dangers he had run in accomplishing his faithful mission.Besides
     that, the General gave him, when he embarked with Colonel
     Stewart, L13 to meet his expenses on the journey.A few days
     after the arrival of my messenger at Khartoum, H.E.General
     Gordon thought it proper to appoint Colonel Stewart for coming to
     Cairo on board a man-of-war with a secret mission, and several
     letters, written by the General in English and Arabic, were put
     in two envelopes, one addressed to the British and the other to
     the Egyptian Government, and were handed over to my messenger,
     with the order to return to Cairo with Colonel Stewart on board a
     special steamer."But when Khartoum fell, and the rebels got into it, making all
     the inhabitants prisoners, the Government officials above
     referred to were informed that my messenger had been arrested,
     and all the correspondence that he had on him, addressed by
     General Gordon to the Government, was seized; for when the
     steamer on board of which they were arrived at Abou Kamar she
     went on rocks, and having been broken, the rebels made a massacre
     of all those who were on board; and as, on seeing the letters
     carried by my messenger, they found amongst them a private letter
     addressed to me by H.E.Gordon Pasha, expressing his thanks for
     my faithfulness to him, the rebels declared me an infidel, and
     decided to seize all my goods and properties, comprising them in
     their _Beit-el-Mal_ (that is, Treasury) as it happened in fact."Moreover, the members of my family who were in the Soudan were
     treated most despotically, and their existence was rendered most
     difficult."Such a state of things being incompatible with the suspicion
     thrown upon me as regards my faithfulness to the Government, I
     have requested the high Government officials referred to above to
     give me an official certificate to that effect, which they all
     gave; and the enclosed copies will make known to those who take
     the trouble to read them that I have been honest and faithful in
     all what has been entrusted to me.This is the summary of the
     information I have obtained from persons I have reason to
     believe."Some further evidence of Zebehr's feelings is given in the following
letter from him to Sir Henry Gordon, dated in October 1884:--

     "Your favour of 3rd September has been duly received, for which I
     thank you.I herewith enclose my photograph, and hope that you
     will kindly send me yours."The letter that you wished me to send H.E.General Gordon was
     sent on the 18th August last, registered.I hope that you will
     excuse me in delaying to reply, for when your letter arrived I
     was absent, and when I returned I was very sorry that they had
     not forwarded the letter to me; otherwise I should have replied
     at once."I had closed this letter with the photograph when I received
     fresh news, to the effect that the messengers we sent to H.E.I therefore kept back the
     letter and photograph till they arrived, and I should see what
     tidings they brought.... You have told me that Lord Northbrook
     knows what has passed between us.I endeavoured and devised to
     see His Excellency, but I did not succeed, as he was very busy.I
     presented a petition to him that he should help to recover the
     property of which I was robbed unjustly, and which H.E.your
     brother ordered to be restored, and at the same time to right me
     for the oppression I had suffered.I have had no answer up to
     this present moment.Gordon Pasha will return in safety, accept my
     best regards, dear Sir, and present my compliments to your
     sister.1884._"

To sum up on this important matter.There never was any doubt that the
authorities in the Delta took on themselves a grave responsibility
when they remained deaf to all Gordon's requests for the co-operation
of Zebehr.They would justify themselves by saying that they had a
tender regard for Gordon's own safety.At least this was the only
point on which they showed it, and they would not like to be deprived
of the small credit attached to it; but the evidence I have now
adduced renders even this plea of doubtful force.As to the value of
Zebehr's co-operation, if Gordon could have obtained it there cannot
be two opinions.Gordon did not exaggerate in the least degree when he
said that on the approach of Zebehr the star of the Mahdi would at
once begin to wane, or, in other words, that he looked to Zebehr's
ability and influence as the sure way to make his own mission a
success.On the very night of his interview with Zebehr, and within forty-eight
hours of his arrival in Cairo, General Gordon and his English
companion, with four Egyptian officers, left by train for Assiout, _en
route_ to Khartoum.Before entering on the events of this crowning passage in the career
of this hero, I think the reader might well consider on its threshold
the exact nature of the adventure undertaken by Gordon as if it were a
sort of everyday experience and duty.At the commencement of the year
1884 the military triumph of the Mahdi was as complete as it could be
throughout the Soudan.Khartoum was still held by a force of between
4000 and 6000 men.Although not known, all the other garrisons in the
Nile Valley, except Kassala and Sennaar, both near the Abyssinian
frontier, had capitulated, and the force at Khartoum would certainly
have offered no resistance if the Mahdi had advanced immediately after
the defeat of Hicks.Even if he had reached Khartoum before the
arrival of Gordon, it is scarcely doubtful that the place would have
fallen without fighting.Colonel de Coetlogon was in command, but the
troops had no faith in him, and he had no confidence in them.That
officer, on 9th January, "telegraphed to the Khedive, strongly urging
an immediate withdrawal from Khartoum.He said that one-third of the
garrison are unreliable, and that even if it were twice as strong as
it is, it would not hold Khartoum against the whole country."In
several subsequent telegrams Colonel de Coetlogon importuned the Cairo
authorities to send him authority to leave with the garrison, and on
the very day that the Government finally decided to despatch Gordon he
telegraphed that there was only just enough time left to escape to
Berber.While the commandant held and expressed these views, it is not
surprising that the garrison and inhabitants were disheartened and
decidedly unfit to make any resolute opposition to a confident and
daring foe.There is excellent independent testimony as to the state
of public feeling in the town.Mr Frank Power had been residing in Khartoum as correspondent of _The
Times_ from August 1883, and in December, after the Hicks catastrophe,
he was appointed Acting British Consul.In a letter written on 12th
January he said: "They have done nothing for us yet from Cairo.They
are leaving it all to fate, and the rebels around us are growing
stronger!"Such was the general situation at Khartoum when General
Gordon was ordered, almost single-handed, to save it; and not merely
to rescue its garrison, pronounced by its commander to be partly
unreliable and wholly inadequate, but other garrisons scattered
throughout the regions held by the Mahdi and his victorious legions.A
courageous man could not have been charged with cowardice if he had
shrunk back from such a forlorn hope, and declined to take on his
shoulders the responsibility that properly devolved on the commander
on the spot.A prudent man would at least have insisted that his
instructions should be clear, and that the part his Government and
country were to play was to be as strictly defined and as obligatory
on them as his own.But while Gordon's courage was of such a quality
that I believe no calculation of odds or difficulties ever entered
into his view, his prudence never possessed the requisite amount of
suspicion to make him provide against the contingencies of absolute
betrayal by those who sent him, or of that change in party convenience
and tactics which induced those who first thought his mission most
advantageous as solving a difficulty, or at least putting off a
trouble, to veer round to the conclusion that his remaining at
Khartoum, his honourable but rigid resolve not to return without the
people he went to save, was a distinct breach of contract, and a
serious offence.The state of feeling at Khartoum was one verging on panic.The richest
townsmen had removed their property and families to Berber.Colonel de
Coetlogon had the river boats with steam up ready to commence the
evacuation, and while everyone thought that the place was doomed, the
telegraph instrument was eagerly watched for the signal to begin the
flight.The tension could not have lasted much longer--without the
signal the flight would have begun--when on 24th January the brief
message arrived: "General Gordon is coming to Khartoum."The panic ceased, confidence was
restored, the apathy of the Cairo authorities became a matter of no
importance, for England had sent her greatest name as a pledge of her
intended action, and the unreliable and insufficient garrison pulled
itself together for one of the most honourable and brilliant defences
in the annals of military sieges.Two months had
been wasted, and, as Mr Power said, "the fellows in Lucknow did not
look more anxiously for Colin Campbell than we are looking for
Gordon."Gordon, ever mindful of the importance of time, and fully
impressed with the sense of how much had been lost by delay, did not
let the grass grow under his feet, and after his two days' delay at
Cairo sent a message that he hoped to reach Khartoum in eighteen days.Mr Power's comment on that message is as follows: "Twenty-four days
is the shortest time from Cairo to Khartoum on record; Gordon says he
will be here in eighteen days; but he travels like a whirlwind."As a
matter of fact, Gordon took twenty days' travelling, besides the two
days he passed at Berber.He thus reached Khartoum on 18th February,
and four days later Colonel de Coetlogon started for Cairo.The entry of Gordon into Khartoum was marked by a scene of
indescribable enthusiasm and public confidence.The whole population,
men, women, and children, turned out to welcome him as a conqueror and
a deliverer, although he really came in his own person merely to cope
with a desperate situation.The women threw themselves on the ground
and struggled to kiss his feet; in the confusion Gordon was several
times pushed down; and this remarkable demonstration of popular
confidence and affection was continued the whole way from the
landing-place to the _Hukumdaria_ or Palace.This greeting was the
more remarkable because it was clear that Gordon had brought no
troops--only one white officer--and it soon became known that he had
brought no money.Even the Mahdi himself made his contribution to the
general tribute, by sending General Gordon on his arrival a formal
_salaam_ or message of respect.Thus hailed on all hands as the one
pre-eminently good man who had been associated with the Soudan, Gordon
addressed himself to the hard task he had undertaken, which had been
rendered almost hopeless of achievement by the lapse of time, past
errors, and the blindness of those who should have supported him.Difficult as it had been all along, it was rendered still more
difficult by the decisive defeat of Baker Pasha and an Egyptian force
of 4000 men at Tokar, near Souakim.This victory was won by Osman
Digma, who had been sent by the Mahdi to rouse up the Eastern Soudan
at the time of the threatened Hicks expedition.The result showed that
the Mahdi had discovered a new lieutenant of great military capacity
and energy, and that the Eastern Soudan was for the time as hopelessly
lost to Egypt as Kordofan and Darfour.The first task to which Gordon addressed himself was to place Khartoum
and the detached work at Omdurman on the left bank of the White Nile
in a proper state of defence, and he especially supervised the
establishment of telegraphic communication between the Palace and the
many outworks, so that at a moment's notice he might receive word of
what was happening.His own favourite position became the flat roof of
this building, whence with his glass he could see round for many
miles.He also laid in considerable stores of provisions by means of
his steamers, in which he placed the greatest faith.In all these
matters he was ably and energetically assisted by Colonel Stewart; and
beyond doubt the other Europeans took some slight share in the
incessant work of putting Khartoum in a proper state of defence; but
even with this relief, the strain, increased by constant alarms of the
Mahdi's hostile approach, was intense, and Mr Power speaks of Gordon
as nearly worn out with work before he had been there a month.When Gordon went to the Soudan his principal object was to effect the
evacuation of the country, and to establish there some administration
which would be answerable for good order and good neighbourship.If
the Mahdi had been a purely secular potentate, and not a fanatical
religious propagandist, it would have been a natural and feasible
arrangement to have come to terms with him as the conqueror of the
country.But the basis of the Mahdi's power forbade his being on terms
with anyone.If he had admitted the equal rights of Egypt and the
Khedive at any point, there would have been an end to his heavenly
mission, and the forces he had created out of the simple but
deep-rooted religious feelings of the Mahommedan clans of the Soudan
would soon have vanished.It is quite possible that General Gordon had
in his first views on the Mahdist movement somewhat undervalued the
forces created by that fanaticism, and that the hopes and opinions he
first expressed were unduly optimistic.If so, it must be allowed that
he lost not a moment in correcting them, and within a week of his
arrival at Khartoum he officially telegraphed to Cairo, that "if Egypt
is to be quiet the Mahdi must be smashed up."When the British Government received that message, as they did in a
few days, with, moreover, the expression of supporting views by Sir
Evelyn Baring, they ought to have reconsidered the whole question of
the Gordon mission, and to have defined their own policy.The
representative they had sent on an exceptional errand to relieve and
bring back a certain number of distressed troops, and to arrange if he
could for the formation of a new government through the notabilities
and ancient families, reports at an early stage of his mission that in
his opinion there is no solution of the difficulty, save by resorting
to offensive measures against the Mahdi as the disturber of the peace,
not merely for that moment, but as long as he had to discharge the
divine task implied by his title.As it was of course obvious that
Gordon single-handed could not take the field, the conclusion
necessarily followed that he would require troops, and the whole
character of his task would thus have been changed.In face of that
absolute _volte-face_, from a policy of evacuation and retreat to one
of retention and advance, for that is what it signified, the
Government would have been justified in recalling Gordon, but as they
did not do so, they cannot plead ignorance of his changed opinion, or
deny that, at the very moment he became acquainted with the real state
of things at Khartoum, he hastened to convey to them his decided
conviction that the only way out of the difficulty was to "smash up
the Mahdi."All his early messages show that there had been a change, or at least
a marked modification, in his opinions.At Khartoum he saw more
clearly than in Cairo or in London the extreme gravity of the
situation, and the consequences to the tranquillity of Lower Egypt
that would follow from the abandonment of Khartoum to the Mahdi.He
therefore telegraphed on the day of his arrival these words: "To
withdraw without being able to place a successor in my seat would be
the signal for general anarchy throughout the country, which, though
all Egyptian element were withdrawn, would be a misfortune, and
inhuman."In the same message he repeated his demand for the services
of Zebehr, through whom, as has been shown, he thought he might be
able to cope with the Mahdi.Yet their very refusal to comply with
that reiterated request should have made the authorities more willing
and eager to meet the other applications and suggestion of a man who
had thrust himself into a most perilous situation at their bidding,
and for the sake of the reputation of his country.It must be recorded
with feelings of shame that it had no such effect, and that apathy and
indifference to the fate of its gallant agent were during the first
few months the only characteristics of the Government policy.At the same period all Gordon's telegrams and despatches showed that
he wanted reinforcements to some small extent, and at least military
demonstrations along his line of communication with Egypt to prove
that he possessed the support of his Government, and that he had only
to call upon it to send troops, and they were there to come.He,
naturally enough, treated as ridiculous the suggestion that he had
bound himself to do the whole work without any support; and fully
convinced that he had only to summon troops for them to be sent him in
the moderate strength he alone cared for, he issued a proclamation in
Khartoum, stating that "British troops are now on their way, and in a
few days will reach Khartoum."He therefore begged for the despatch of
a small force to Wady Halfa, and he went on to declare that it would
be "comparatively easy to destroy the Mahdi" if 200 British troops
were sent to Wady Halfa, and if the Souakim-Berber route were opened
up by Indian-Moslem troops.Failing the adoption of these measures, he
asked leave to raise a sum, by appealing to philanthropists,
sufficient to pay a small Turkish force and carry on a contest for
supremacy with the Mahdi on his own behoof.All these suggestions
were more or less supported by Sir Evelyn Baring, who at last
suggested in an important despatch, dated 28th February, that the
British Government should withdraw altogether from the matter, and
"give full liberty of action to General Gordon and the Khedive's
Government to do what seems best to them."Well would it have been for Gordon and everyone whose reputation was
concerned if this step had been taken, for the Egyptian Government,
the Khedive, his ministers Nubar and Cherif, were opposed to all
surrender, and desired to hold on to Khartoum and the Souakim-Berber
route.But without the courage and resolution to discharge it, the
Government saw the obligation that lay on them to provide for the
security and good government of Egypt, and that if they shirked
responsibility in the Soudan, the independence of Egypt might be
accomplished by its own effort and success.They perceived the
objections to giving Egypt a free hand, but they none the less
abstained from taking the other course of definite and decisive action
on their own initiative.As Gordon quickly saw and tersely expressed:
"You will not let Egypt keep the Soudan, you will not take it
yourself, and you will not permit any other country to occupy it."As if to give emphasis to General Gordon's successive
requests--Zebehr, 200 men to Wady Halfa, opening of route from Souakim
to Berber, presence of English officers at Dongola, and of Indian
cavalry at Berber--telegraphic communication with Khartoum was
interrupted early in March, less than a fortnight after Gordon's
arrival in the town.There was consequently no possible excuse for
anyone ignoring the dangerous position in which General Gordon was
placed.He had gone to face incalculable dangers, but now the success
of Osman Digma and the rising of the riparian tribes threatened him
with that complete isolation which no one had quite expected at so
early a stage after his arrival.It ought, and one would have expected
it, to have produced an instantaneous effect, to have braced the
Government to the task of deciding what its policy should be when
challenged by its own representative to declare it.Gordon himself
soon realised his own position, for he wrote: "I shall be caught in
Khartoum; and even if I was mean enough to escape I have not the power
to do so."After a month's interruption he succeeded in getting the
following message, dated 8th April, through, which is significant as
showing that he had abandoned all hope of being supported by his own
Government:--

     "I have telegraphed to Sir Samuel Baker to make an appeal to
     British and American millionaires to give me L300,000 to engage
     3000 Turkish troops from the Sultan and send them here.This
     would settle the Soudan and Mahdi for ever.For my part, I think
     you (Baring) will agree with me.I do not see the fun of being
     caught here to walk about the streets for years as a dervish with
     sandalled feet.Not that (_D.V._) I will ever be taken alive.It
     would be the climax of meanness after I had borrowed money from
     the people here, had called on them to sell their grain at a low
     price, etc., to go and abandon them without using every effort to
     relieve them, whether those efforts are diplomatically correct or
     not; and I feel sure, whatever you may feel diplomatically, I
     have your support, and that of every man professing himself a
     gentleman, in private."Eight days later he succeeded in getting another message through, to
the following effect:--

     "As far as I can understand, the situation is this.You state
     your intention of not sending any relief up here or to Berber,
     and you refuse me Zebehr.I consider myself free to act according
     to circumstances.I shall hold on here as long as I can, and if I
     can suppress the rebellion I shall do so.If I cannot, I shall
     retire to the Equator and leave you the indelible disgrace of
     abandoning the garrisons of Senaar, Kassala, Berber, and Dongola,
     with the _certainty_ that you will eventually be forced to smash
     up the Mahdi under greater difficulties if you wish to maintain
     peace in, and, indeed, to retain Egypt."Before a silence of five and a half months fell over Khartoum, Gordon
had been able to make three things clear, and of these only one could
be described as having a personal signification, and that was that the
Government, by rejecting all his propositions, had practically
abandoned him to his fate.The two others were that any settlement
would be a work of time, and that no permanent tranquillity could be
attained without overcoming the Mahdi.Immediately on arriving at Khartoum he perceived that the evacuation
of the Soudan, with safety to the garrison and officials, as well as
the preservation of the honour of England and Egypt, would necessarily
be a work of time, and only feasible if certain measures were taken in
his support, which, considerable as they may have appeared at the
moment, were small and costless in comparison with those that had
subsequently to be sanctioned.Six weeks sufficed to show Gordon that
he would get no material help from the Government, and he then began
to look elsewhere for support, and to propound schemes for pacifying
the Soudan and crushing the Mahdi in which England and the Government
would have had no part.Hence his proposal to appeal to wealthy
philanthropists to employ Turkish troops, and in the last resort to
force his way to the Equator and the Congo.Even that avenue of safety
was closed to him by the illusory prospect of rescue held out to him
by the Government at the eleventh hour, when success was hardly
attainable.For the sake of clearness it will be well to give here a brief summary
of the siege during the six months that followed the arrival of
General Gordon and the departure of Colonel Stewart on 10th September.The full and detailed narrative is contained in Colonel Stewart's
Journal, which was captured on board his steamer.This interesting
diary was taken to the Mahdi at Omdurman, and is said to be carefully
preserved in the Treasury.The statement rests on no very sure
foundation, but if true the work may yet thrill the audience of the
English-speaking world.But even without its aid the main facts of the
siege of Khartoum, down at all events to the 14th December, when
Gordon's own diary stops, are sufficiently well known for all the
purposes of history.At a very early stage of the siege General Gordon determined to try
the metal of his troops, and the experiment succeeded to such a
perfect extent that there was never any necessity to repeat it.On
16th March, when only irregular levies and detached bodies of
tribesmen were in the vicinity of Khartoum, he sent out a force of
nearly 1000 men, chiefly Bashi-Bazouks, but also some regulars, with a
fieldpiece and supported by two steamers.The force started at eight
in the morning, under the command of Colonel Stewart, and landed at
Halfiyeh, some miles down the stream on the right bank of the Nile.Here the rebels had established a sort of fortified position, which it
was desirable to destroy, if it could be done without too much loss.The troops were accordingly drawn up for the attack, and the gun and
infantry fire commenced to cover the advance.At this moment about
sixty rebel horsemen came out from behind the stockade and charged the
Bashi-Bazouks, who fired one volley and fled.The horsemen then
charged the infantry drawn up in square, which they broke, and the
retreat to the river began at a run.Discouraging as this was for a
force of all arms to retire before a few horsemen one-twentieth its
number, the disaster was rendered worse and more disheartening by the
conduct of the men, who absolutely refused to fight, marching along
with shouldered arms without firing a shot, while the horsemen picked
off all who straggled from the column.The gun, a considerable
quantity of ammunition, and about sixty men represented the loss of
Gordon's force; the rebels are not supposed to have lost a single man."Nothing could be more dismal than seeing these horsemen, and some men
even on camels, pursuing close to troops who with shouldered arms
plodded their way back."Thus wrote Gordon of the men to whom he had
to trust for a successful defence of Khartoum.His most recent
experience confirmed his old opinion, that the Egyptian and Arab
troops were useless even when fighting to save their own lives, and he
could only rely on the very small body left of black Soudanese, who
fought as gallantly for him as any troops could, and whose loyalty and
devotion to him surpassed all praise.Treachery, it was assumed, had
something to do with the easy overthrow of this force, and two Pashas
were shot for misconduct on return to Khartoum.Having no confidence in the bulk of his force, it is not surprising
that Gordon resorted to every artifice within engineering science to
compensate for the shortcomings of his army.He surrounded
Khartoum--which on one side was adequately defended by the Nile and
his steamers--on the remaining three sides with a triple line of land
mines connected by wires.Often during the siege the Mahdists
attempted to break through this ring, but only to meet with repulse,
accompanied by heavy loss; and to the very last day of the siege they
never succeeded in getting behind the third of these lines.Their
efficacy roused Gordon's professional enthusiasm, and in one passage
he exclaims that these will be the general form of defence in the
future.During the first months of the siege, which began rather in
the form of a loose investment, the Nile was too low to allow of his
using the nine steamers he possessed, but he employed the time in
making two new ones, and in strengthening them all with bulwarks of
iron plates and soft wood, which were certainly bullet-proof.Each of
these steamers he valued as the equivalent of 2000 men.When it is
seen how he employed them the value will not be deemed excessive, and
certainly without them he could not have held Khartoum and baffled all
the assaults of the Mahdi for the greater part of a year.After this experience Gordon would risk no more combats on land, and
on 25th March he dismissed 250 of the Bashi-Bazouks who had behaved so
badly.Absolutely trustworthy statistics are not available as to the
exact number of troops in Khartoum or as to the proportion the Black
Soudanese bore to the Egyptians, but it approximates to the truth to
say that there were about 1000 of the former to 3000 of the latter,
and with other levies during the siege he doubled this total.For
these and a civilian population of nearly 40,000 Gordon computed that
he had provisions for five months from March, and that for at least
two months he would be as safe as in Cairo.By carefully husbanding
the corn and biscuit he was able to make the supply last much longer,
and even to the very end he succeeded in partially replenishing the
depleted granaries of the town.There is no necessity to repeat the
details of the siege during the summer of 1884.They are made up of
almost daily interchanges of artillery fire from the town, and of
rifle fire in reply from the Arab lines.That this was not merely
child's play may be gathered from two of Gordon's protected ships
showing nearly a thousand bullet-marks apiece.Whenever the rebels
attempted to force their way through the lines they were repulsed by
the mines; and the steamers not only inflicted loss on their fighting
men, but often succeeded in picking up useful supplies of food and
grain.No further reverses were reported, because Gordon was most
careful to avoid all risk, and the only misfortunes occurred in
Gordon's rear, when first Berber, through the treachery of the Greek
Cuzzi, and then Shendy passed into the hands of the Mahdists, thus, as
Gordon said, "completely hemming him in."In April a detached force up
the Blue Nile went over to the Mahdi, taking with them a small
steamer, but this loss was of no great importance, as the men were of
what Gordon called "the Arabi hen or hero type," and the steamer could
not force its way past Khartoum and its powerful flotilla.In the four
months from 16th March to 30th July Gordon stated that the total loss
of the garrison was only thirty killed and fifty or sixty wounded,
while half a million cartridges had been fired against the enemy.The
conduct of both the people and garrison had been excellent, and this
was the more creditable, because Gordon was obliged from the very
beginning, owing to the capture of the bullion sent him at Berber, to
make all payments in paper money bearing his signature and seal.During that period the total reinforcement to the garrison numbered
seven men, including Gordon himself, while over 2600 persons had been
sent out of it in safety as far as Berber.The reader will be interested in the following extracts from a letter
written by Colonel Duncan, R.A., M.P., showing the remarkable way in
which General Gordon organised the despatch of these refugees from
Khartoum.The letter is dated 29th November 1886, and addressed to
Miss Gordon:--

     "When your brother, on reaching Khartoum, found that he could
     commence sending refugees to Egypt, I was sent on the 3rd March
     1884 to Assouan and Korosko to receive those whom he sent down.As an instance of your brother's thoughtfulness, I may mention
     that he requested that, if possible, some motherly European woman
     might also be sent, as many of the refugees whom he had to send
     had never been out of the Soudan before, and might feel strange
     on reaching Egypt.A German, Giegler Pasha, who had been in
     Khartoum with your brother before, and who had a German wife, was
     accordingly placed at my disposal, and I stationed them at
     Korosko, where almost all the refugees arrived.I may mention
     that I saw and spoke to every one of the refugees who came down,
     and to many of the women and children.Their references to your
     brother were invariably couched in language of affection and
     gratitude, and the adjective most frequently applied to him was
     'just.'In sending away the people from Khartoum, he sent away
     the Governor and some of the other leading Egyptian officials
     first.I think he suspected they would intrigue; he always had
     more confidence in the people than in the ruling Turks or
     Egyptians.The oldest soldiers, the very infirm, the wounded
     (from Hicks's battles) were sent next, and a ghastly crew they
     were.But the precautions he took for their comfort were very
     complete, and although immediately before reaching me they had to
     cross a very bad part of the desert between Abou Hamed and
     Korosko, they reached me in wonderful spirits.It was touching to
     see the perfect confidence they had that the promises of Gordon
     Pasha would be fulfilled.After the fall of Khartoum, and your
     brother's death, a good many of the Egyptian officers who had
     been with your brother managed to escape, and to come down the
     river disguised in many cases as beggars.I had an opportunity of
     talking to most of them, and there was no collusion, for they
     arrived at different times and by different roads.I remember
     having a talk with one, and when we alluded to your brother's
     death he burst out crying like a child, and said that though he
     had lost his wives and children when Khartoum was taken, he felt
     it as nothing to the loss of 'that just man.'"The letters written at the end of July at Khartoum reached Cairo at
the end of September, and their substance was at once telegraphed to
England.They showed that, while his success had made him think that
after all there might be some satisfactory issue of the siege, he
foresaw that the real ordeal was yet to come."In four months (that is
end of November) river begins to fall; before that time you _must_
settle the Soudan question."So wrote the heroic defender of Khartoum
in words that could not be misunderstood, and those words were in the
hands of the British Ministers when half the period had expired.At
the same time Mr Power wrote: "We can at best hold out but two months
longer."Gordon at least never doubted what their effect would be, for
after what seemed to him a reasonable time had elapsed to enable this
message to reach its destination, he took the necessary steps to
recover Berber, and to send his steamers half-way to meet and assist
the advance of the reinforcement on which he thought from the
beginning he might surely rely.On 10th September all his plans were completed, and Colonel Stewart,
accompanied by a strong force of Bashi-Bazouks and some black
soldiers, with Mr Power and M. Herbin, the French consul, sailed
northwards on five steamers.The first task of this expedition was if
possible, to retake Berber, or, failing that, to escort the _Abbas_
past the point of greatest danger; the second, to convey the most
recent news about Khartoum affairs to Lower Egypt; and the third was
to lend a helping hand to any force that might be coming up the Nile
or across the desert from the Red Sea.Five days after its departure
Gordon knew through a spy that Stewart's flotilla had passed Shendy in
safety, and had captured a valuable Arab convoy.It was not till
November that the truth was known how the ships bombarded Berber, and
passed that place not only in safety, but after causing the rebels
much loss and greater alarm, and then how Stewart and his European
companions went on in the small steamer _Abbas_ to bear the tale of
the wonderful defence of Khartoum to the outer world--a defence which,
wonderful as it was, really only reached the stage of the miraculous
after they had gone and had no further part in it.So far as Gordon's
military skill and prevision could arrange for their safety, he did
so, and with success.When the warships had to return he gave them the
best advice against treachery or ambuscade:--"Do not anchor near the
bank, do not collect wood at isolated spots, trust nobody."If they had paid strict heed to his advice, there
would have been no catastrophe at Dar Djumna.These reflections invest
with much force Gordon's own view of the matter:--"If _Abbas_ was
captured by treachery, then I am not to blame; neither am I to blame
if she struck a rock, for she drew under two feet of water; if they
were attacked and overpowered, then I am to blame."So perfect were
his arrangements that only treachery, aided by Stewart's
over-confidence, baffled them.With regard to the wisdom of the course pursued in thus sending away
all his European colleagues--the Austrian consul Hensall alone
refusing to quit Gordon and his place of duty--opinions will differ to
the end of time, but one is almost inclined to say that they could not
have been of much service to Gordon once their uppermost thought
became to quit Khartoum.The whole story is told very graphically in a
passage of Gordon's own diary:--

     "I determined to send the _Abbas_ down with an Arab captain.Then
     Stewart said he would go if I would exonerate him from deserting
     me.I said, 'You do not desert me.I cannot go; but if you go you
     do great service.'I then wrote him an official; he wanted me to
     write him an order.I said 'No; for, though I fear not
     responsibility, I will not put you in any danger in which I am
     not myself.'I wrote them a letter couched thus:--'_Abbas_ is
     going down; you say you are willing to go in her if I think you
     can do so in honour.You can go in honour, for you can do
     nothing here; and if you go you do me service in telegraphing my
     views.'"There are two points in this matter to which I must draw marked
attention.The suggestion for any European leaving Khartoum came from
M. Herbin, and when Gordon willingly acquiesced, Colonel Stewart asked
leave to do likewise.Mr Power, whose calculation was that provisions
would be exhausted before the end of September, then followed suit,
and not one of these three of the five Europeans in Khartoum seem to
have thought for a moment what would be the position of Gordon left
alone to cope with the danger from which they ran away.The suggestion
as to their going came in every case from themselves.Gordon, in his
thought for others, not merely threw no obstacle in their way, but as
far as he could provided for their safety as if they were a parcel of
women.But he declined all responsibility for their fate, as they went
not by his order but of their own free-will.He gave them his ships,
soldiers, and best counsel.They neglected the last, and were taken in
in a manner that showed less than a child's suspicion, and were
massacred at the very moment they felt sure of safety.It was a cruel
fate, and a harsh Nemesis speedily befell them for doing perhaps the
one unworthy thing of their lives--leaving their solitary companion to
face the tenfold dangers by which he would be beset.But it cannot be
allowed any longer that the onus of this matter should rest in any way
on Gordon.They went because they wanted to go, and he, knowing well
that men with such thoughts would be of no use to him ("you can do
nothing here") let them go, and even encouraged them to do so.Under
the circumstances he preferred to be alone.Colonel Donald Stewart was
a personal friend of mine, and a man whose courage in the ordinary
sense of the word could not be aspersed, but there cannot be two
opinions that he above all the others should not have left his
brother-in-arms alone in Khartoum.After their departure Gordon had to superintend everything himself,
and to resort to every means of husbanding the limited supply of
provisions he had left.He had also to anticipate a more vigorous
attack, for the Mahdi must quickly learn of the departure of the
steamers, the bombardment of Berber, and the favourable chance thus
provided for the capture of Khartoum.Nor was this the worst, for on
the occurrence of the disaster the Mahdi was promptly informed of the
loss of the _Abbas_ and the murder of the Europeans, and it was he
himself who sent in to Gordon the news of the catastrophe, with so
complete a list of the papers on the _Abbas_ as left no ground for
hope or disbelief.Unfortunately, before this bad news reached Gordon,
he had again, on 30th September, sent down to Shendy three
steamers--the _Talataween_, the _Mansourah_, and _Saphia_, with
troops on board, and the gallant Cassim-el-Mousse, there to await the
arrival of the relieving force.He somewhat later reinforced this
squadron with the _Bordeen_; and although one or two of these boats
returned occasionally to Khartoum, the rest remained permanently at
Shendy, and when the English troops reached the Nile opposite that
place all five were waiting them.Without entering too closely into
details, it is consequently correct to say that during the most
critical part of the siege Gordon deprived himself of the co-operation
of these vessels, each of which he valued at 2000 men, simply and
solely because he believed that reinforcements were close at hand, and
that some troops at the latest would arrive before the end of November
1884.As Gordon himself repeatedly said, it would have been far more
just if the Government had told him in March, when he first demanded
reinforcements as a right, that he must shift for himself.Then he
would have kept these boats by him, and triumphantly fought his way in
them to the Equator.But his trust in the Government, notwithstanding
all his experience, led him to weaken his own position in the hope of
facilitating their movements, and he found their aid a broken reed.In
only one passage of his journal does Gordon give expression to this
view, although it was always present to his mind:--"Truly the
indecision of our Government has been, from a military point of view,
a very great bore, for we never could act as if independent; there was
always the chance of their taking action, which hampered us."But in
the telegrams to Sir Evelyn Baring and Mr Egerton, which the
Government never dared to publish, and which are still an official
secret, he laid great stress on this point, and on Sir Evelyn Baring's
message forbidding him to retire to the Equator, so that, if he sought
safety in that direction, he would be indictable on a charge of
desertion.The various positions at Khartoum held by Gordon's force may be
briefly described.First, the town itself, on the left bank of the
Blue Nile, but stretching almost across to the right bank of the White
Nile, protected on the land side by a wall, in front of which was the
triple line of mines, and on the water side by the river and the
steamers.On the right bank of the Blue Nile was the small North Fort.Between the two stretched the island of Tuti, and at each end of the
wall, on the White Nile as well as the Blue, Gordon had stationed a
_santal_ or heavy-armed barge, carrying a gun.Unfortunately, a large
part of the western end of the Khartoum wall had been washed away by
an inundation of the Nile, but the mines supplied a substitute, and so
long as Omdurman Fort was held this weakness in the defences of
Khartoum did not greatly signify.That fort itself lay on the left
bank of the White Nile.It was well built and fairly strong, but the
position was faulty.It lay in a hollow, and the trench of the
extensive camp formed for Hicks's force furnished the enemy with
cover.It was also 1200 yards from the river bank, and when the enemy
became more enterprising it was impossible to keep up communication
with it.In Omdurman Fort was a specially selected garrison of 240
men, commanded by a gallant black officer, Ferratch or Faragalla
Pasha, who had been raised from a subordinate capacity to the
principal command under him by Gordon.Gordon's point of observation
was the flat roof of the Palace, whence he could see everything with
his telescope, and where he placed his best shots to bear on any point
that might seem hard pressed.Still more useful was it for the purpose
of detecting the remissness of his own troops and officers, and often
his telescope showed him sentries asleep at their posts, and officers
absent from the points they were supposed to guard.From the end of March until the close of the siege scarcely a day
passed without the exchange of artillery and rifle fire on one side or
the other of the beleaguered town.On special occasions the Khedive's
garrison would fire as many as forty or even fifty thousand rounds of
Remington cartridges, and the Arab fire was sometimes heavier.This
incessant fire, as the heroic defender wrote in his journal, murdered
sleep, and at last he became so accustomed to it that he could tell by
the sound where the firing was taking place.The most distant points
of the defence, such as the _santal_ on the White Nile and Fort
Omdurman, were two miles from the Palace; and although telegraphic
communication existed with them during the greater part of the siege,
the oral evidence as to the point of attack was often found the most
rapid means of obtaining information.This was still more advantageous
after the 12th of November, for on that day communications were cut
between Khartoum and Omdurman, and it was found impossible to restore
them.The only communications possible after that date were by bugle
and flag.At the time of this severance Gordon estimated that the
garrison of Omdurman had enough water and biscuit for six weeks, and
that there were 250,000 cartridges in the arsenal.Gordon did
everything in his power to aid Ferratch in the defence, and his
remaining steamer, the _Ismailia_, after the grounding of the
_Husseinyeh_ on the very day Omdurman was cut off, was engaged in
almost daily encounters with the Mahdists for that purpose.Owing to
Gordon's incessant efforts, and the gallantry of the garrison led by
Ferratch, Omdurman held out more than two months.It was not until
15th January that Ferratch, with Gordon's leave, surrendered, and then
when the Mahdists occupied the place, General Gordon had the
satisfaction of shelling them out of it, and showing that it was
untenable.The severance of Omdurman from Khartoum was the prelude to fiercer
fighting than had taken place at any time during the earlier stages of
the siege, and although particulars are not obtainable for the last
month of the period, there is no doubt that the struggle was
incessant, and that the fighting was renewed from day to day.It was
then that Gordon missed the ships lying idle at Shendy.If he had had
them Omdurman would not have fallen, nor would it have been so easy
for the Mahdi to transport the bulk of his force from the left to the
right bank of the White Nile, as he did for the final assault on the
fatal 26th January.At the end of October the Mahdi, accompanied by a far more numerous
force than Gordon thought he could raise, described by Slatin as
countless, pitched his camp a few miles south of Omdurman.On 8th
November his arrival was celebrated by a direct attack on the lines
south of Khartoum.The rebels in their fear of the hidden mines, which
was far greater than it need have been, as it was found they had been
buried too deep, resorted to the artifice of driving forward cows, and
by throwing rockets among them Gordon had the satisfaction of
spreading confusion in their ranks, repulsing the attack, and
capturing twenty of the animals.Four days later the rebels made the
desperate attack on Omdurman, when, as stated, communications were
cut, and the _Husseinyeh_ ran aground.In attempting to carry her off
and to check the further progress of the rebels the _Ismailia_ was
badly hit, and the incident was one of those only too frequent at all
stages of the siege, when Gordon wrote: "Every time I hear the gun
fire I have a twitch of the heart of gnawing anxiety for my penny
steamers."At the very moment that these fights were in progress he
wrote, 10th November: "To-day is the day I expected we should have had
some one of the Expedition here;" and he also recorded that we "have
enough biscuit for a month or so"--meaning at the outside six weeks.Throughout the whole of November rumours of a coming British
Expedition were prevalent, but they were of the vaguest and most
contradictory character.On 25th November Gordon learnt that it was
still at Ambukol, 185 miles further away from Khartoum than he had
expected, and his only comment under this acute disappointment was,
"This is lively!"Up to the arrival of the Mahdi daily desertions of his Arab and other
soldiers to Gordon took place, and by these and levies among the
townspeople all gaps in the garrison were more than filled up.Such
was the confidence in Gordon that it more than neutralised all the
intrigues of the Mahdi's agents in the besieged town, and scarcely a
man during the first seven months of the siege deserted him; but after
the arrival of the Mahdi there was a complete change in this respect.In the first place there were no more desertions to Gordon, and then
men began to leave him, partly, no doubt, from fear of the Mahdi, or
awakened fanaticism, but chiefly through the non-arrival of the
British Expedition, which had been so much talked about, yet which
never came.Still to all the enemy's invitations to surrender on the
most honourable terms Gordon gave defiant answers."I am here like
iron, and I hope to see the newly-arrived English;" and when the
situation had become little short of desperate, at the end of the
year, he still, with bitter agony at his heart, proudly rejected all
overtures, and sent the haughty message: "Can hold Khartoum for twelve
years."He had read the truth in
all the papers captured on Stewart's steamer, and he knew that
Gordon's resources were nearly spent.Even some of the messages Gordon
sent out by spies for Lord Wolseley's information fell into his hands,
and on one of these Slatin says it was written: "Can hold Khartoum at
the outside till the end of January."Although Gordon may be
considered to have more than held his own against all the power of the
Mahdi down to the capture of Omdurman Fort on 15th January, the Mahdi
knew that his straits must be desperate, and that unless the
expedition arrived he could not hold out much longer.The first
advance of the English troops on 3rd January across the desert towards
the Nile probably warned the enemy that now was the time to renew the
attack with greater vigour, but it does not seem that there is any
justification for the entirely hypothetical view that at any point the
Mahdi could have seized the unhappy town.Omdurman Fort itself fell,
not to the desperate onset of his Ghazis, but from the want of food
and ammunition, and with Gordon's expressed permission to the
commandant to surrender.Unfortunately the details of the most tragic
part of the siege are missing, but Gordon himself well summed up what
he had done up to the end of October when his position was secure, and
aid, as he thought, was close at hand:--

     "The news of Hicks's defeat was known in Cairo three weeks after
     the event occurred; since that date up to this (29th October
     1884) nine people have come up as reinforcements--myself,
     Stewart, Herbin, Hussein, Tongi, Ruckdi, and three servants, and
     not one penny of money.Of those who came up two, Stewart and
     Herbin, have gone down, Hussein is dead; so six alone remain,
     while we must have sent down over 1500 and 700 soldiers, total
     2200, including the two Pashas, Coetlogon, etc.The regulars, who
     were in arrears of pay for three months when I came, are now only
     owed half a month, while the Bashi-Bazouks are owed only a
     quarter month, and we have some L500 in the Treasury.It is quite
     a miracle.We have lost two battles, suffering severe losses in
     these actions of men and arms, and may have said to have
     scrambled through, for I cannot say we can lay claim to any great
     success during the whole time.I believe we have more ammunition
     (Remington) and more soldiers now than when I came up.We have
     L40,000 in Treasury _in paper_ and L500.When I came up there was
     L5000 in Treasury.We have L15,000 out in the town in paper
     money."At the point (14th December) when the authentic history of the
protracted siege and gallant defence of Khartoum stops, a pause may be
made to turn back and describe what the Government and country which
sent General Gordon on his most perilous mission, and made use of his
extraordinary devotion to the call of duty to extricate themselves
from a responsibility they had not the courage to face, had been doing
not merely to support their envoy, but to vindicate their own honour.The several messages which General Gordon had succeeded in getting
through had shown how necessary some reinforcement and support were at
the very commencement of the siege.The lapse of time, rendered the
more expressive by the long period of silence that fell over what was
taking place in the besieged town, showed, beyond need of
demonstration, the gravity of the case and the desperate nature of the
situation.But a very little of the knowledge at the command of the
Government from a number of competent sources would have enabled it to
foresee what was certain to happen, and to have provided some remedy
for the peril long before the following despairing message from Gordon
showed that the hour when any aid would be useful had almost expired.This was the passage, dated 13th December, in the last (sixth) volume
of the Journal, but the substance of which reached Lord Wolseley by
one of Gordon's messengers at Korti on 31st December:--

     "We are going to send down the _Bordeen_ the day after to-morrow,
     and with her I shall send this Journal._If some effort is not
     made before ten days' time the town will fall._ It is
     inexplicable this delay.If the Expeditionary forces have reached
     the river and met my steamers, one hundred men are all that we
     require just to show themselves.... Even if the town falls under
     the nose of the Expeditionary forces it will not in my opinion
     justify the abandonment of Senaar and Kassala, or of the
     Equatorial Province by H.M.All that is absolutely
     necessary is for fifty of the Expeditionary force to get on board
     a steamer and come up to Halfiyeh, and thus let their presence be
     felt.This is not asking much, but it must happen _at once_, or
     it will (as usual) be too late."The motives which induced Mr Gladstone's Government to send General
Gordon to the Soudan in January 1884 were, as has been clearly shown,
the selfish desire to appease public opinion, and to shirk in the
easiest possible manner a great responsibility.They had no policy at
all, but they had one supreme wish, viz.to cut off the Soudan from
Egypt; and if the Mahdi had only known their wishes and pressed on,
and treated the Khartoum force as he had treated that under Hicks,
there would have been no garrisons to rescue, and that British
Government would have done nothing.It recked nothing of the grave
dangers that would have accrued from the complete triumph of the
Mahdi, or of the outbreak that must have followed in Lower Egypt if
his tide of success had not been checked as it was single-handed by
General Gordon, through the twelve months' defence of Khartoum.Still
it could not quite stoop to the dishonour of abandoning these
garrisons, and of making itself an accomplice to the Mahdi's
butcheries, nor could it altogether turn a deaf ear to the
representations and remonstrances of even such a puppet prince as the
Khedive Tewfik.England was then far more mistress of the situation at
Cairo than she is now, but a helpless refusal to discharge her duty
might have provoked Europe into action at the Porte that would have
proved inconvenient and damaging to her position and reputation.Therefore the Government fell back on General Gordon, and the hope was
even indulged that, under his exceptional reputation, the evacuation
of the Soudan might not only be successfully carried out, but that his
success might induce the public and the world to accept that
abnegation of policy as the acme of wisdom.In all this they were
destined to a complete awakening, and the only matter of surprise is
that they should have sent so well-known a character as General
Gordon, whose independence and contempt for official etiquette and
restraint were no secrets at the Foreign and War Offices, on a mission
in which they required him not only to be as indifferent to the
national honour as they were, but also to be tied and restrained by
the shifts and requirements of an embarrassed executive.At a very early stage of the mission the Government obtained evidence
that Gordon's views on the subject were widely different from theirs.They had evidently persuaded themselves that their policy was Gordon's
policy; and before he was in Khartoum a week he not merely points out
that the evacuation policy is not his but theirs, and that although he
thinks its execution is still possible, the true policy is, "if Egypt
is to be quiet, that the Mahdi must be smashed up."The hopes that had
been based on Gordon's supposed complaisance in the post of
representative on the Nile of the Government policy were thus
dispelled, and it became evident that Gordon, instead of being a tool,
was resolved to be master, so far as the mode of carrying out the
evacuation policy with full regard for the dictates of honour was to
be decided.Nor was this all, or the worst of the revelations made to
the Government in the first few weeks after his arrival at Khartoum.While expressing his willingness and intention to discharge the chief
part of his task, viz.the withdrawal of the garrisons, which was all
the Government cared about, he also descanted on the moral duty and
the inevitable necessity of setting up a provisional government that
should avert anarchy and impose some barrier to the Mahdi's progress.All this was trying to those who only wished to be rid of the whole
matter, but Gordon did not spare their feelings, and phrase by phrase
he revealed what his own policy would be and what his inner wishes,
however repressed his charge might keep them, really were.Having told them that "the Mahdi must be smashed up," he went on to
say that "we cannot hurry over this affair" (the future of the Soudan)
"if we do we shall incur disaster," and again that, although "it is a
miserable country it is joined to Egypt, and it would be difficult to
divorce the two."Within a very few weeks, therefore, the Government
learnt that its own agent was the most forcible and damaging critic of
the policy of evacuation, and that the worries of the Soudan question
for an administration not resolute enough to solve the difficulty in a
thorough manner were increased and not diminished by Gordon's mission.At that point the proposition was made and supported by several
members of the Cabinet that Gordon should be recalled.There is no
doubt that this step would have been taken but for the fear that it
would aggravate the difficulties of the English expedition sent to
Souakim under the command of General Gerald Graham to retrieve the
defeat of Baker Pasha.Failing the adoption of that extreme measure,
which would at least have been straightforward and honest, and
ignoring what candour seemed to demand if a decision had been come to
to render Gordon no support, and to bid him shift for himself, the
Government resorted to the third and least justifiable course of all,
viz.of showing indifference to the legitimate requests of their
emissary, and of putting off definite action until the very last
moment.We have seen that Gordon made several specific demands in the first
six weeks of his stay at Khartoum--that is, in the short period before
communication was cut off.He wanted Zebehr, 200 troops at Berber, or
even at Wady Halfa, and the opening of the route from Souakim to the
Nile.To these requests not one favourable answer was given, and the
not wholly unnatural rejection of the first rendered it more than ever
necessary to comply with the others.They were such as ought to have
been granted, and in anticipation they had been suggested and
discussed before Gordon felt bound to urge them as necessary for the
security of his position at Khartoum.Even Sir Evelyn Baring had
recommended in February the despatch of 200 men to Assouan for the
moral effect, and that was the very reason why Gordon asked, in the
first place, for the despatch of a small British force to at least
Wady Halfa.It is possible that one of the chief reasons for the
Government rejecting all these suggestions, and also, it must be
remembered, doing nothing in their place towards the relief and
support of their representative, may have been the hope that this
treatment would have led him to resign and throw up his mission.They
would then have been able to declare that, as the task was beyond the
powers of General Gordon, they were only coming to the prudent and
logical conclusion in saying that nothing could be done, and that the
garrisons had better come to terms with the Mahdi.Unfortunately for
those who favoured the evasion of trouble as the easiest and best way
out of the difficulty, Gordon had high notions as to what duty
required.No difficulty had terrors for him, and while left at the
post of power and responsibility he would endeavour to show himself
equal to the charge.Yet there can be no doubt that those who sent him would have rejoiced
if he had formally asked to be relieved of the task he had accepted,
and Mr Gladstone stated on the 3rd April that "Gordon was under no
orders and no restraint to stay at Khartoum."A significant answer to
the fact represented in that statement was supplied, when, ten days
later, silence fell on Khartoum, and remained unbroken for more than
five months.But at the very moment that the Prime Minister made that
statement as to Gordon's liberty of movement, the Government knew of
the candid views which he had expressed as to the proper policy for
the Soudan.It should have been apparent that, unless they and their
author were promptly repudiated, and unless the latter was stripped of
his official authority, the Government would, however tardily and
reluctantly, be drawn after its representative into a policy of
intervention in the Soudan, which it, above everything else,
wished to avoid.He told them "time,"
"reinforcements," and a very considerable expenditure was necessary to
honourably carry out their policy of evacuation.They were not
prepared to concede any of these save the last, and even the money
they sent him was lost because they would send it by Berber instead of
Kassala.But they knew that "the order and restraint" which kept
Gordon at Khartoum was the duty he had contracted towards them when he
accepted his mission, and which was binding on a man of his principles
until they chose to relieve him of the task.The fear of public
opinion had more to do with their abstaining from the step of ordering
his recall than the hope that his splendid energy and administrative
power might yet provide some satisfactory issue from the dilemma, for
at the very beginning it was freely given out that "General Gordon
was exceeding his instructions."The interruption of communications with Khartoum at least suspended
Gordon's constant representations as to what he thought the right
policy, as well as his demands for the fulfilment by the Government of
their side of the contract.It was then that Lord Granville seemed to
pluck up heart of grace, and to challenge Gordon's right to remain at
Khartoum.On 23rd April Lord Granville asked for explanation of "cause
of detention."Unfortunately it was not till months later that the
country knew of Gordon's terse and humorous reply, "cause of
detention, these horribly plucky Arabs."Lord Granville, thinking this
despatch not clear enough, followed it up on 17th May by instructing
Mr Egerton, then acting for Sir Evelyn Baring, to send the following
remonstrance to Gordon:

     "As the original plan for the evacuation of the Soudan has been
     dropped, and as aggressive operations cannot be undertaken with
     the countenance of H.M.'s Government, General Gordon is enjoined
     to consider, and either to report upon, or, if possible, to adopt
     at the first proper moment measures for his own removal and for
     that of the Egyptians at Khartoum who have suffered for him, or
     who have served him faithfully, including their wives and
     children, by whatever route he may consider best, having especial
     regard to his own safety and that of the other British subjects."Then followed suggestions and authority to pay so much a head for
refugees safely escorted to Korosko.The comment Gordon made on that,
and similar despatches, to save himself and any part of the garrison
he could, was that he was not so mean as to desert those who had nobly
stood by him and committed themselves on the strength of his word.It is impossible to go behind the collective responsibility of the
Government and to attempt to fix any special responsibility or blame
on any individual member of that Government.The facts as I read them
show plainly that there was a complete abnegation of policy or purpose
on the part of the British Government, that Gordon was then sent as a
sort of stop-gap, and that when it was revealed that he had strong
views and clear plans, not at all in harmony with those who sent him,
it was thought, by the Ministers who had not the courage to recall
him, very inconsiderate and insubordinate of him to remain at his post
and to refuse all the hints given him, that he ought to resign unless
he would execute a _sauve qui peut_ sort of retreat to the frontier.Very harsh things have been said of Mr Gladstone and his Cabinet on
this point, but considering their views and declarations, it is not so
very surprising that Gordon's boldness and originality alarmed and
displeased them.Their radical fault in these early stages of the
question was not that they were indifferent to Gordon's demands, but
that they had absolutely no policy.They could not even come to the
decision, as Gordon wrote, "to abandon altogether and not care what
happens."But all these minor points were merged in a great common national
anxiety when month after month passed during the spring and summer of
1884, and not a single word issued from the tomb-like silence of
Khartoum.People might argue that the worst could not have happened,
as the Mahdi would have been only too anxious to proclaim his triumph
far and wide if Khartoum had fallen.Anxiety may be diminished, but is
not banished, by a calculation of probabilities, and the military
spirit and capacity exhibited by the Mahdi's forces under Osman Digma
in the fighting with General Graham's well-equipped British force at
Teb and Tamanieb revealed the greatness of the peril with which Gordon
had to deal at Khartoum where he had only the inadequate and
untrustworthy garrison described by Colonel de Coetlogon.During the
summer of 1884 there was therefore a growing fear, not only that the
worst news might come at any moment, but that in the most favourable
event any news would reveal the desperate situation to which Gordon
had been reduced, and with that conviction came the thought, not
whether he had exactly carried out what Ministers had expected him to
do, but solely of his extraordinary courage and devotion to his
country, which had led him to take up a thankless task without the
least regard for his comfort or advantage, and without counting the
odds.There was at least one Minister in the Cabinet who was struck by
that single-minded conduct; and as early as April, when his colleagues
were asking the formal question why Gordon did not leave Khartoum, the
Marquis of Hartington, then Minister of War, and now Duke of
Devonshire, began to inquire as to the steps necessary to rescue the
emissary, while still adhering to the policy of the Administration of
which he formed part.During the whole of that summer the present Duke
of Devonshire advocated the special claim of General Gordon on the
Government, whose mandate he had so readily accepted, and urged the
necessity of special measures being taken at the earliest moment to
save the gallant envoy from what seemed the too probable penalty of
his own temerity and devotion.But for his energetic and consistent
representations the steps that were taken--all too late as they
proved--never would have been taken at all, or deferred to such a date
as to let the public see by the event that there was no use in
throwing away money and precious lives on a lost cause.If the first place among those in power--for of my own and other
journalists' efforts in the Press to arouse public opinion and to urge
the Government to timely action it is unnecessary to speak--is due to
the Duke of Devonshire, the second may reasonably be claimed by Lord
Wolseley.This recognition is the more called for here, because the
most careful consideration of the facts has led me to the conclusion,
which I would gladly avoid the necessity of expressing if it were
possible, that Lord Wolseley was responsible for the failure of the
relief expedition.This stage of responsibility has not yet been
reached, and it must be duly set forth that on 24th July Lord
Wolseley, then Adjutant-General, wrote a noble letter, stating that,
as he "did not wish to share the responsibility of leaving Charley
Gordon to his fate," he recommended "immediate action," and "the
despatch of a small brigade of between three and four thousand British
soldiers to Dongola, so that they might reach that place about 15th
October."But even that date was later than it ought to have been,
especially when the necessity of getting the English troops back as
early in the New Year as possible was considered, and in the
subsequent recriminations that ensued, the blame for being late from
the start was sought to be thrown on the badness of the Nile flood
that year.General Gordon himself cruelly disposed of that theory or
excuse when he wrote, "It was not a bad Nile; quite an average one.Still, Lord Wolseley must not be
robbed of the credit of having said on 24th July that an expedition
was necessary to save Gordon, "his old friend and Crimean comrade,"
towards whom Wolseley himself had contracted a special moral
obligation for his prominent share in inducing him to accept the very
mission that had already proved so full of peril.In short, if the
plain truth must be told, Lord Wolseley was far more responsible for
the despatch of General Gordon to Khartoum than Mr Gladstone.The result of the early representations of the Duke of Devonshire, and
the definite suggestion of Lord Wolseley, was that the Government gave
in when the public anxiety became so great at the continued silence of
Khartoum, and acquiesced in the despatch of an expedition to relieve
General Gordon.Having once made the concession, it must be allowed
that they showed no niggard spirit in sanctioning the expedition and
the proposals of the military authorities.The sum of ten millions was
devoted to the work of rescuing Gordon by the very persons who had
rejected his demands for the hundredth part of that total.Ten
thousand men selected from the _elite_ of the British army were
assigned to the task for which he had begged two hundred men in vain.It is impossible here to enter closely into the causes which led to
the expansion of the three or four thousand British infantry into a
special corps of ten thousand fighting men, picked from the crack
regiments of the army, and composed of every arm of the service
compelled to fight under unaccustomed conditions.The local
authorities--in particular Major Kitchener, now the Sirdar of the
Egyptian army, who is slowly recovering from the Mahdi the provinces
which should never have been left in his possession--protested that
the expedition should be a small one, and if their advice had been
taken the cost would have been about one-fourth that incurred, and the
force would have reached Khartoum by that 11th November on which
Gordon expected to see the first man of it.But Major Kitchener,
although, as Gordon wrote, "one of the few really first-class officers
in the British army," was only an individual, and his word did not
possess a feather's weight before the influence of the Pall Mall band
of warriors who have farmed out our little wars--India, of course,
excepted--of the last thirty years for their own glorification.So
great a chance of fame as "the rescue of Gordon" was not to be left to
some unknown brigadiers, or to the few line regiments, the proximity
of whose stations entitled them to the task.That would be neglecting
the favours of Providence.For so noble a task the control of the most
experienced commander in the British army would alone suffice, and
when he took the field his staff had to be on the extensive scale that
suited his dignity and position.As there would be some reasonable
excuse for the dispensation of orders and crosses from a campaign
against a religious leader who had not yet known defeat, any friend
might justly complain if he was left behind.To justify so brilliant a
staff, no ordinary British force would suffice.Therefore our
household brigade, our heavy cavalry, and our light cavalry were
requisitioned for their best men, and these splendid troops were
drafted and amalgamated into special corps--heavy and light
camelry--for work that would have been done far better and more
efficiently by two regiments of Bengal Lancers.If all this effort and
expenditure had resulted in success, it would be possible to keep
silent and shrug one's shoulders; but when the mode of undertaking
this expedition can be clearly shown to have been the direct cause of
its failure, silence would be a crime.When Lord Wolseley told the
soldiers at Korti on their return from Metemmah, "It was not _your_
fault that Gordon has perished and Khartoum fallen," the positiveness
of his assurance may have been derived from the inner conviction of
his own stupendous error.The expedition was finally sanctioned in August, and the news of its
coming was known to General Gordon in September, before, indeed, his
own despatches of 31st July were received in London, and broke the
suspense of nearly half a year.He thought that only a small force was
coming, under the command of Major-General Earle, and he at once, as
already described, sent his steamers back to Shendy, there to await
the troops and convey them to Khartoum.He seems to have calculated
that three months from the date of the message informing him of the
expedition would suffice for the conveyance of the troops as far as
Berber or Metemmah, and at that rate General Earle would have arrived
where his steamers awaited him early in November.Gordon's views as to
the object of the expedition, which somebody called the Gordon Relief
Expedition, were thus clearly expressed:--

     "I altogether decline the imputation that the projected
     expedition has come to relieve me.It has come to save our
     National honour in extricating the garrisons, etc., from a
     position in which our action in Egypt has placed these garrisons.As for myself, I could make good my retreat at any moment, if I
     wished.Now realise what would happen if this first relief
     expedition was to bolt, and the steamers fell into the hands of
     the Mahdi.This second relief expedition (for the honour of
     England engaged in extricating garrisons) would be somewhat
     hampered.We, the first and second expeditions, are equally
     engaged for the honour of England.I came up
     to extricate the garrison, and failed.Earle comes up to
     extricate garrisons, and I hope succeeds.Earle does not come to
     extricate me.The extrication of the garrisons was supposed to
     affect our "National honour."If Earle succeeds, the "National
     honour" thanks him, and I hope recommends him, but it is
     altogether independent of me, who, for failing, incurs its blame.I am not _the rescued lamb_, and I will not be."Lord Wolseley, still possessed with the idea that, now that an
expedition had been sanctioned, the question of time was not of
supreme importance, and that the relieving expedition might be carried
out in a deliberate manner, which would be both more effective and
less exposed to risk, did not reach Cairo till September, and had only
arrived at Wady Halfa on 8th October, when his final instructions
reached him in the following form:--"The primary object of your
expedition is to bring away General Gordon and Colonel Stewart, and
you are not to advance further south than necessary to attain that
object, and when it has been secured, no further offensive operations
of any kind are to be undertaken."It had,
however, determined to leave the garrisons to their fate, despite the
National honour being involved, at the very moment that it sanctioned
an enormous expenditure to try and save the lives of its
long-neglected representatives, Gordon and Colonel Stewart.With
extraordinary shrewdness, Gordon detected the hollowness of its
purpose, and wrote:--"I very much doubt what is really going to be the
policy of our Government, even now that the Expedition is at Dongola,"
and if they intend ratting out, "the troops had better not come beyond
Berber till the question of what will be done is settled."The receipt of Gordon's and Power's despatches of July showed that
there were, at the time of their being written, supplies for four
months, which would have carried the garrison on till the end of
November.As the greater part of that period had expired when these
documents reached Lord Wolseley's hands, it was quite impossible to
doubt that time had become the most important factor of all in the
situation.The chance of being too late would even then have presented
itself to a prudent commander, and, above all, to a friend hastening
to the rescue of a friend.The news that Colonel Stewart and some
other Europeans had been entrapped and murdered near Merowe, which
reached the English commander from different sources before Gordon
confirmed it in his letters, was also calculated to stimulate, by
showing that Gordon was alone, and had single-handed to conduct the
defence of a populous city.Hard on the heels of that intelligence
came Gordon's letter of 4th November to Lord Wolseley, who received it
at Dongola on 14th of the same month.The letter was a long one, but
only two passages need be quoted:--"At Metemmah, waiting your orders,
are five steamers with nine guns."Did it not occur to anyone how
greatly, at the worst stage of the siege, Gordon had thus weakened
himself to assist the relieving expedition?Even for that reason there
was not a day or an hour to be lost.But the letter contained a worse and more alarming passage:--"We can
hold out forty days with ease; after that it will be difficult."Forty
days would have meant till 14th December, one month ahead of the day
Lord Wolseley received the news, but the message was really more
alarming than the form in which it was published, for there is no
doubt that the word "difficult" is the official rendering of Gordon's,
a little indistinctly written, word "desperate."In face of that
alarming message, which only stated facts that ought to have been
surmised, if not known, it was no longer possible to pursue the
leisurely promenade up the Nile, which was timed so as to bring the
whole force to Khartoum in the first week of March.Rescue by the most
prominent general and swell troops of England at Easter would hardly
gratify the commandant and garrison starved into surrender the
previous Christmas, and that was the exact relationship between
Wolseley's plans and Gordon's necessities.The date at which Gordon's supplies would be exhausted varied not from
any miscalculation, but because on two successive occasions he
discovered large stores of grain and biscuits, which had been stolen
from the public granaries before his arrival.The supplies that would
all have disappeared in November were thus eked out, first till the
middle of December, and then finally till the end of January, but
there is no doubt that they would not have lasted as long as they did
if in the last month of the siege he had not given the civil
population permission to leave the doomed town.From any and from
every point of view, there was not the shadow of an excuse for a
moment's delay after the receipt of that letter on 14th November.With the British Exchequer at a commander's back, it is easy to
organise an expedition on an elaborate scale, and to carry it out with
the nicety of perfection, but for the realisation of these ponderous
plans there is one thing more necessary, and that is time.I have no
doubt if Gordon's letter had said "granaries full, can hold out till
Easter," that Lord Wolseley's deliberate march--Cairo, September 27;
Wady Halfa, October 8; Dongola, November 14; Korti, December 30;
Metemmah any day in February, and Khartoum, March 3, and those were
the approximate dates of his grand plan of campaign--would have been
fully successful, and held up for admiration as a model of skill.Unfortunately, it would not do for the occasion, as Gordon was on the
verge of starvation and in desperate straits when the rescuing force
reached Dongola.It is not easy to alter the plan of any campaign, nor
to adapt a heavy moving machine to the work suitable for a light one.To feed 10,000 British soldiers on the middle Nile was alone a feat of
organisation such as no other country could have attempted, but the
effort was exhausting, and left no reserve energy to despatch that
quick-moving battalion which could have reached Gordon's steamers
early in December, and would have reinforced the Khartoum garrison,
just as Havelock and Outram did the Lucknow Residency.Dongola is only 100 miles below Debbeh, where the intelligence
officers and a small force were on that 14th November; Ambukol,
specially recommended by Gordon as the best starting-point, is less
than fifty miles, and Korti, the point selected by Lord Wolseley, is
exactly that distance above Debbeh.The Bayuda desert route by the
Jakdul Wells to Metemmah is 170 miles.At Metemmah were the five
steamers with nine guns to convoy the desperately needed succour to
Khartoum.The energy expended on the despatch of 10,000 men up 150
miles of river, if concentrated on 1000 men, must have given a
speedier result, but, as the affair was managed, the last day of the
year 1884 was reached before there was even that small force ready to
make a dash across the desert for Metemmah.The excuses made for this, as the result proved, fatal delay of taking
six weeks to do what--the forward movement from Dongola to Korti, not
of the main force, but of 1000 men--ought to have been done in one
week, were the dearth of camels, the imperfect drill of the camel
corps, and, it must be added, the exaggerated fear of the Mahdi's
power.When it was attempted to quicken the slow forward movement of
the unwieldy force confusion ensued, and no greater progress was
effected than if things had been left undisturbed.The erratic policy
in procuring camels caused them at the critical moment to be not
forthcoming in anything approaching the required numbers, and this
difficulty was undoubtedly increased by the treachery of Mahmoud
Khalifa, who was the chief contractor we employed.Even when the
camels were procured, they had to be broken in for regular work, and
the men accustomed to the strange drill and mode of locomotion.The
last reason perhaps had the most weight of all, for although the Mahdi
with all his hordes had been kept at bay by Gordon single-handed, Lord
Wolseley would risk nothing in the field.Probably the determining
reason for that decision was that the success of a small force would
have revealed how absolutely unnecessary his large and costly
expedition was.Yet events were to show beyond possibility of
contraversion that this was the case, for not less than two-thirds of
the force were never in any shape or form actively employed, and, as
far as the fate of Gordon went, might just as well have been left at
home.They had, however, to be fed and provided for at the end of a
line of communication of over 1200 miles.Still, notwithstanding all these delays and disadvantages, a
well-equipped force of 1000 men was ready on 30th December to leave
Korti to cross the 170 miles of the Bayuda desert.That route was well
known and well watered.There were wells at, at least, five places,
and the best of these was at Jakdul, about half-way across.The
officer entrusted with the command was Major-General Sir Herbert
Stewart, an officer of a gallant disposition, who was above all others
impressed with the necessity of making an immediate advance, with the
view of throwing some help into Khartoum.Unfortunately he was
trammelled by his instructions, which were to this effect--he was to
establish a fort at Jakdul; but if he found an insufficiency of water
there he was at liberty to press on to Metemmah.His action was to be
determined by the measure of his own necessities, not of Gordon's, and
so Lord Wolseley arranged throughout.He reached that place with his
1100 fighting men, but on examining the wells and finding them full,
he felt bound to obey the orders of his commander, viz.to establish
the fort, and then return to Korti for a reinforcement.It was a case
when Nelson's blind eye might have been called into requisition, but
even the most gallant officers are not Nelsons.The first advance of General Stewart to Jakdul, reached on 3rd January
1885, was in every respect a success.It was achieved without loss,
unopposed, and was quite of the nature of a surprise.The British
relieving force was at last, after many months' report, proved to be
a reality, and although late, it was not too late.If General Stewart
had not been tied by his instructions, but left a free hand, he would
undoubtedly have pressed on, and a reinforcement of British troops
would have entered Khartoum even before the fall of Omdurman.But it
must be recorded also that Sir Herbert Stewart was not inspired by the
required flash of genius.He paid more deference to the orders of Lord
Wolseley than to the grave peril of General Gordon.General Stewart returned to Korti on the 7th January, bringing with
him the tired camels, and he found that during his absence still more
urgent news had been received from Gordon, to the effect that if aid
did not come within ten days from the 14th December, the place might
fall, and that under the nose of the expedition.The native who
brought this intimation arrived at Korti the day after General Stewart
left, but a messenger could easily have caught him up and given him
orders to press on at all cost.It was not realised at the time, but
the neglect to give that order, and the rigid adherence to a
preconceived plan, proved fatal to the success of the whole
expedition.The first advance of General Stewart had been in the nature of a
surprise, but it aroused the Mahdi to a sense of the position, and the
subsequent delay gave him a fortnight to complete his plans and assume
the offensive.On 12th January--that is, nine days after his first arrival at
Jakdul--General Stewart reached the place a second time with the
second detachment of another 1000 men--the total fighting strength of
the column being raised to about 2300 men.For whatever errors had
been committed, and their consequences, the band of soldiers assembled
at Jakdul on that 12th of January could in no sense be held
responsible.Without making any invidious comparisons, it may be
truthfully said that such a splendid fighting force was never
assembled in any other cause, and the temper of the men was strung to
a high point of enthusiasm by the thought that at last they had
reached the final stage of the long journey to rescue Gordon.A number
of causes, principally the fatigue of the camels from the treble
journey between Korti and Jakdul, made the advance very slow, and five
days were occupied in traversing the forty-five miles between Jakdul
and the wells at Abou Klea, themselves distant twenty miles from
Metemmah.On the morning of 17th January it became clear that the
column was in presence of an enemy.At the time of Stewart's first arrival at Jakdul there were no hostile
forces in the Bayuda desert.At Berber was a considerable body of the
Mahdi's followers, and both Metemmah and Shendy were held in his name.At the latter place a battery or small fort had been erected, and in
an encounter between it and Gordon's steamers one of the latter had
been sunk, thus reducing their total to four.But there were none of
the warrior tribes of Kordofan and Darfour at any of these places, or
nearer than the six camps which had been established round Khartoum.The news of the English advance made the Mahdi bestir himself, and as
it was known that the garrison of Omdurman was reduced to the lowest
straits, and could not hold out many days, the Mahdi despatched some
of his best warriors of the Jaalin, Degheim, and Kenana tribes to
oppose the British troops in the Bayuda desert.It was these men who
opposed the further advance of Sir Herbert Stewart's column at Abou
Klea.It is unnecessary to describe the desperate assault these
gallant warriors made on the somewhat cumbrous and ill-arranged square
of the British force, or the ease and tremendous loss with which these
fanatics were beaten off, and never allowed to come to close quarters,
save at one point.The infantry soldiers, who formed two sides of the
square, signally repulsed the onset, not a Ghazi succeeded in getting
within a range of 300 yards; but on another side, cavalrymen, doing
infantry soldiers' unaccustomed work, did not adhere to the strict
formation necessary, and trained for the close _melee_, and with the
_gaudia certaminis_ firing their blood, they recklessly allowed the
Ghazis to come to close quarters, and their line of the square was
impinged upon.In that close fighting, with the Heavy Camel Corps men
and the Naval Brigade, the Blacks suffered terribly, but they also
inflicted loss in return.Of a total loss on the British side of
sixty-five killed and sixty-one wounded, the Heavy Camel Corps lost
fifty-two, and the Sussex Regiment, performing work to which it was
thoroughly trained, inflicted immense loss on the enemy at hardly any
cost to itself.Among the slain was the gallant Colonel Fred.Burnaby,
one of the noblest and gentlest, as he was physically the strongest,
officers in the British army.There is no doubt that signal as was
this success, it shook the confidence of the force.The men were
resolute to a point of ferocity, but the leaders' confidence in
themselves and their task had been rudely tried; and yet the breaking
of the square had been clearly due to a tactical blunder, and the
inability of the cavalry to adapt themselves to a strange position.On the 18th January the march, rendered slower by the conveyance of
the wounded, was resumed, but no fighting took place on that day,
although it was clear that the enemy had not been dispersed.On the
19th, when the force had reached the last wells at Abou Kru or Gubat,
it became clear that another battle was to be fought.One of the first
shots seriously wounded Sir Herbert Stewart, and during the whole of
the affair many of our men were carried off by the heavy rifle fire of
the enemy.Notwithstanding that our force fought under many
disadvantages and was not skilfully handled, the Mahdists were driven
off with terrible loss, while our force had thirty-six killed and one
hundred and seven wounded.Notwithstanding these two defeats, the
enemy were not cowed, and held on to Metemmah, in which no doubt those
who had taken part in the battles were assisted by a force from
Berber.The 20th January was wasted in inaction, caused by the large
number of wounded, and when on 21st January Metemmah was attacked, the
Mahdists showed so bold a front that Sir Charles Wilson, who succeeded
to the command on Sir Herbert Stewart being incapacitated by his, as
it proved, mortal wound, drew off his force.This was the more
disappointing, because Gordon's four steamers arrived during the
action and took a gallant part in the attack.It was a pity for the
effect produced that that attack should have been distinctly
unsuccessful.The information the captain of these steamers, the
gallant Cassim el Mousse, gave about Gordon's position was alarming.He stated that Gordon had sent him a message informing him that if aid
did not come in ten days from the 14th December his position would be
desperate, and the volumes of his journal which he handed over to Sir
Charles Wilson amply corroborated this statement--the very last entry
under that date being these memorable words: "Now, mark this, if the
Expeditionary Force--and I ask for no more than 200 men--does not come
in ten days, _the town may fall_, and I have done my best for the
honour of our country.The other letters handed over by Cassim el Mousse amply bore out the
view that a month before the British soldiers reached the last stretch
of the Nile to Khartoum Gordon's position was desperate.In one to his
sister he concluded, "I am quite happy, thank God, and, like Lawrence,
have tried to do my duty," and in another to his friend Colonel
Watson: "I think the game is up, and send Mrs Watson, yourself, and
Graham my adieux.We may expect a catastrophe in the town in or after
ten days.This would not have happened (if it does happen) if our
people had taken better precautions as to informing us of their
movements, but this is'spilt milk.'"In face of these documents,
which were in the hands of Sir Charles Wilson on 21st January, it is
impossible to agree with his conclusion in his book "Korti to
Khartoum," that "the delay in the arrival of the steamers at Khartoum
was unimportant" as affecting the result.Every hour, every minute,
had become of vital importance.If the whole Jakdul column had been
destroyed in the effort, it was justifiable to do so as the price of
reinforcing Gordon, so that he could hold out until the main body
under Lord Wolseley could arrive.I am not one of those who think
that Sir Charles Wilson, who only came on the scene at the last
moment, should be made the scapegoat for the mistakes of others in the
earlier stages of the expedition, and I hold now, as strongly as when
I wrote the words, the opinion that, "in the face of what he did, any
suggestion that he might have done more would seem both ungenerous and
untrue."Still the fact remains that on 21st January there was left a
sufficient margin of time to avert what actually occurred at daybreak
on the 26th, for the theory that the Mahdi could have entered the town
one hour before he did was never a serious argument, while the
evidence of Slatin Pasha strengthens the view that Gordon was at the
last moment only overcome by the Khalifa's resorting to a surprise.On
one point of fact Sir Charles Wilson seems also to have been in error.He fixes the fall of Omdurman at 6th January, whereas Slatin, whose
information on the point ought to be unimpeachable, states that it did
not occur until the 15th of that month.When Sir Herbert Stewart had fought and won the battle of Abou Klea,
it was his intention on reaching the Nile, as he expected to do the
next day, to put Sir Charles Wilson on board one of Gordon's own
steamers and send him off at once to Khartoum.The second battle and
Sir Herbert Stewart's fatal wound destroyed that project.But this
plan might have been adhered to so far as the altered circumstances
would allow.Sir Charles Wilson had succeeded to the command, and many
matters affecting the position of the force had to be settled before
he was free to devote himself to the main object of the dash forward,
viz.the establishment of communications with Gordon and Khartoum.As
the consequence of that change in his own position, it would have been
natural that he should have delegated the task to someone else, and in
Lord Charles Beresford, as brave a sailor as ever led a cutting-out
party, there was the very man for the occasion.Unfortunately, Sir
Charles Wilson did not take this step for, as I believe, the sole
reason that he was the bearer of an important official letter to
General Gordon, which he did not think could be entrusted to any other
hands.But for that circumstance it is permissible to say that one
steamer--there was more than enough wood on the other three steamers
to fit one out for the journey to Khartoum--would have sailed on the
morning of the 22nd, the day after the force sheered off from
Metemmah, and, at the latest, it would have reached Khartoum on
Sunday, the 25th, just in time to avert the catastrophe.But as it was done, the whole of the 22nd and 23rd were taken up in
preparing two steamers for the voyage, and in collecting scarlet coats
for the troops, so that the effect of real British soldiers coming up
the Nile might be made more considerable.on Saturday, the
24th, Sir Charles Wilson at last sailed with the two steamers,
_Bordeen_ and _Talataween_, and it was then quite impossible for the
steamers to cover the ninety-five miles to Khartoum in time.Moreover,
the Nile had, by this time, sunk to such a point of shallowness that
navigation was specially slow and even dangerous.The Shabloka
cataract was passed at 3 P.M.on the afternoon of Sunday; then the
_Bordeen_ ran on a rock, and was not got clear till 9 P.M.On the 27th, Halfiyeh, eight miles from Khartoum, was
reached, and the Arabs along the banks shouted out that Gordon was
killed and Khartoum had fallen.Still Sir Charles Wilson went on past
Tuti Island, until he made sure that Khartoum had fallen and was in
the hands of the dervishes.Then he ordered full steam down stream
under as hot a fire as he ever wished to experience, Gordon's black
gunners working like demons at their guns.On the 29th the
_Talataween_ ran on a rock and sank, its crew being taken on board the
_Bordeen_.Two days later the _Bordeen_ shared the same fate, but the
whole party was finally saved on the 4th February by a third steamer,
brought up by Lord Charles Beresford.But these matters, and the
subsequent progress of the Expedition which had so ignominiously
failed, have no interest for the reader of Gordon's life.It failed to
accomplish the object which alone justified its being sent, and, it
must be allowed, that it accepted its failure in a very tame and
spiritless manner.Even at the moment of the British troops turning
their backs on the goal which they had not won, the fate of Gordon
himself was unknown, although there could be no doubt as to the main
fact that the protracted siege of Khartoum had terminated in its
capture by the cruel and savage foe, whom it, or rather Gordon, had so
long defied.I have referred to the official letter addressed to General Gordon, of
which Sir Charles Wilson was the bearer.That letter has never been
published, and it is perhaps well for its authors that it has not
been, for, however softened down its language was by Lord Wolseley's
intercession, it was an order to General Gordon to resign the command
at Khartoum, and to leave that place without a moment's delay.Had it
been delivered and obeyed (as it might have been, because Gordon's
strength would probably have collapsed at the sight of English
soldiers after his long incarceration), the next official step would
have been to censure him for having remained at Khartoum against
orders.Thus would the primary, and, indeed, sole object of the
Expedition have been attained without regard for the national honour,
and without the discovery of that policy, the want of which was the
only cause of the calamities associated with the Soudan.After the 14th of December there is no trustworthy, or at least,
complete evidence, as to what took place in Khartoum.A copy of one of
the defiant messages Gordon used to circulate for the special purpose
of letting them fall into the hands of the Mahdi was dated 29th of
that month, and ran to the effect, "Can hold Khartoum for years."There was also the final message to the Sovereigns of the Powers,
undated, and probably written, if at all, by Gordon, during the final
agony of the last few weeks, perhaps when Omdurman had fallen.It was
worded as follows:--

     "After salutations, I would at once, calling to mind what I have
     gone through, inform their Majesties, the Sovereigns, of the
     action of Great Britain and the Ottoman Empire, who appointed me
     as Governor-General of the Soudan for the purpose of appeasing
     the rebellion in that country."During the twelve months that I have been here, these two
     Powers, the one remarkable for her wealth, and the other for her
     military force, have remained unaffected by my situation--perhaps
     relying too much on the news sent by Hussein Pasha Khalifa, who
     surrendered of his own accord."Although I, personally, am too insignificant to be taken into
     account, the Powers were bound, nevertheless, to fulfil the
     engagement upon which my appointment was based, so as to shield
     the honour of the Governments."What I have gone through I cannot describe.The Almighty God
     will help me."Although this copy was not in Gordon's own writing, it was brought
down by one of his clerks, who escaped from Khartoum, and he declared
that the original had been sent in a cartridge case to Dongola.The
style is certainly the style of Gordon, and there was no one in the
Soudan who could imitate it.It seems safe, as Sir Henry Gordon did,
to accept it as the farewell message of his brother.Until fresh evidence comes to light, that of Slatin Pasha, then a
chained captive in the Mahdi's camp, is alone entitled to the
slightest credence, and it is extremely graphic.We can well believe
that up to the last moment Gordon continued to send out
messages--false, to deceive the Mahdi, and true to impress Lord
Wolseley.The note of 29th December was one of the former; the little
French note on half a cigarette paper, brought by Abdullah Khalifa to
Slatin to translate early in January, may have been one of the latter.It said:--"Can hold Khartoum at the outside till the end of January."Slatin then describes the fall of Omdurman on 15th January, with
Gordon's acquiescence, which entirely disposes of the assertion that
Ferratch, the gallant defender of that place during two months, was a
traitor, and of how, on its surrender, Gordon's fire from the western
wall of Khartoum prevented the Mahdists occupying it.He also comments
on the alarm caused by the first advance of the British force into the
Bayuda desert, and of the despatch of thousands of the Mahdi's best
warriors to oppose it.Those forces quitted the camp at Omdurman
between 10th and 15th January, and this step entirely disposes of the
theory that the Mahdi held Khartoum in the hollow of his hand, and
could at any moment take it.As late as the 15th of January, Gordon's
fire was so vigorous and successful that the Mahdi was unable to
retain possession of the fort which he had just captured.The story had best be continued in the words used by the witness.Six
days after the fall of Omdurman loud weeping and wailing filled the
Mahdi's camp.As the Mahdi forbade the display of sorrow and grief it
was clear that something most unusual had taken place.Then it came
out that the British troops had met and utterly defeated the tribes,
with a loss to the Mahdists of several thousands.Within the next two
or three days came news of the other defeat at Abou Kru, and the loud
lamentations of the women and children could not be checked.The Mahdi
and his chief emirs, the present Khalifa Abdullah prominent among
them, then held a consultation, and it was decided, sooner than lose
all the fruits of the hitherto unchecked triumph of their cause, to
risk an assault on Khartoum.At night on the 24th, and again on the
25th, the bulk of the rebel force was conveyed across the river to the
right bank of the White Nile; the Mahdi preached them a sermon,
promising them victory, and they were enjoined to receive his remarks
in silence, so that no noise was heard in the beleaguered city.By
this time their terror of the mines laid in front of the south wall
had become much diminished, because the mines had been placed too low
in the earth, and they also knew that Gordon and his diminished force
were in the last stages of exhaustion.Finally, the Mahdi or his
energetic lieutenant decided on one more arrangement, which was
probably the true cause of their success.The Mahdists had always
delivered their attack half an hour after sunrise; on this occasion
they decided to attack half an hour before dawn, when the whole scene
was covered in darkness.Slatin knew all these plans, and as he
listened anxiously in his place of confinement he was startled, when
just dropping off to sleep, by "the deafening discharge of thousands
of rifles and guns; this lasted for a few minutes, then only
occasional rifle shots were heard, and now all was quiet again.Could
this possibly be the great attack on Khartoum?A wild discharge of
firearms and cannon, and in a few minutes complete silence!"Some hours afterwards three black soldiers
approached, carrying in a bloody cloth the head of General Gordon,
which he identified.It is unnecessary to add the gruesome details
which Slatin picked up as to his manner of death from the gossip of
the camp.In this terrible tragedy ended that noble defence of
Khartoum, which, wherever considered or discussed, and for all time,
will excite the pity and admiration of the world.There is no need to dwell further on the terrible end of one of the
purest heroes our country has ever produced, whose loss was national,
but most deeply felt as an irreparable shock, and as a void that can
never be filled up by that small circle of men and women who might
call themselves his friends.Ten years elapsed after the eventful
morning when Slatin pronounced over his remains the appropriate
epitaph, "A brave soldier who fell at his post; happy is he to have
fallen; his sufferings are over!"before the exact manner of Gordon's
death was known, and some even clung to the chance that after all he
might have escaped to the Equator, and indeed it was not till long
after the expedition had returned that the remarkable details of his
single-handed defence of Khartoum became known.Had all these
particulars come out at the moment when the public learnt that
Khartoum had fallen, and that the expedition was to return without
accomplishing anything, it is possible that there would have been a
demand that no Minister could have resisted to avenge his fate; but it
was not till the publication of the journals that the exact character
of his magnificent defence and of the manner in which he was treated
by those who sent him came to be understood and appreciated by the
nation.The lapse of time has been sufficient to allow of a calm judgment
being passed on the whole transaction, and the considerations which I
have put forward with regard to it in the chronicle of events have
been dictated by the desire to treat all involved in the matter with
impartiality.If they approximate to the truth, they warrant the
following conclusions.The Government sent General Gordon to the
Soudan on an absolutely hopeless mission for any one or two men to
accomplish without that support in reinforcements on which General
Gordon thought he could count.General Gordon went to the Soudan, and
accepted that mission in the enthusiastic belief that he could arrest
the Mahdi's progress, and treating as a certainty which did not
require formal expression the personal opinion that the Government,
for the national honour, would comply with whatever demands he made
upon it.As a simple matter of fact, every one of those demands, some
against and some with Sir Evelyn Baring's authority, were rejected.No
incident could show more clearly the imperative need of definite
arrangements being made even with Governments; and in this case the
precipitance with which General Gordon was sent off did not admit of
him or the Government knowing exactly what was in the other's mind.Ostensibly of one mind, their views on the matter in hand were really
as far as the poles asunder.There then comes the second phase of the question--the alleged
abandonment of General Gordon by the Government which enlisted his
services in face of an extraordinary, and indeed unexampled danger and
difficulty.The evidence, while it proves conclusively and beyond
dispute that Mr Gladstone's Government never had a policy with regard
to the Soudan, and that even Gordon's heroism, inspiration, and
success failed to induce them to throw aside their lethargy and take
the course that, however much it may be postponed, is inevitable, does
not justify the charge that it abandoned Gordon to his fate.It
rejected the simplest and most sensible of his propositions, and by
rejecting them incurred an immense expenditure of British treasure and
an incalculable amount of bloodshed; but when the personal danger to
its envoy became acute, it did not abandon him, but sanctioned the
cost of the expedition pronounced necessary to effect his rescue.This
decision, too late as it was to assist in the formation of a new
administration for the Soudan, or to bring back the garrisons, was
taken in ample time to ensure the personal safety and rescue of
General Gordon.In the literal sense of the charge, history will
therefore acquit Mr Gladstone and his colleagues of the abandonment of
General Gordon personally.With regard to the third phase of the question--viz.the failure of
the attempt to rescue General Gordon, which was essentially a
military, and not a political question--the responsibility passes from
the Prime Minister to the military authorities who decided the scope
of the campaign, and the commander who carried it out.In this case,
the individual responsible was the same.Lord Wolseley not only had
his own way in the route to be followed by the expedition, and the
size and importance attached to it, but he was also entrusted with its
personal direction.There is consequently no question of the
sub-division of the responsibility for its failure, just as there
could have been none of the credit for its success.Lord Wolseley
decided that the route should be the long one by the Nile Valley, not
the short one from Souakim to Berber.Lord Wolseley decreed that there
should be no Indian troops, and that the force, instead of being an
ordinary one, should be a picked special corps from the _elite_ of the
British army; and finally Lord Wolseley insisted that there should be
no dash to the rescue of Gordon by a small part of his force, but a
slow, impressive, and overpoweringly scientific advance of the whole
body.The extremity of Gordon's distress necessitated a slight
modification of his plan, when, with qualified instructions, which
practically tied his hands, Sir Herbert Stewart made his first
appearance at Jakdul.It was then known to Lord Wolseley that Gordon was in extremities,
yet when a fighting force of 1100 English troops, of special physique
and spirit, was moved forward with sufficient transport to enable it
to reach the Nile and Gordon's steamers, the commander's instructions
were such as confined him to inaction, unless he disobeyed his orders,
which only Nelsons and Gordons can do with impunity.It is impossible
to explain this extraordinary timidity.Sir Herbert Stewart reached
Jakdul on 3rd January with a force small in numbers, but in every
other respect of remarkable efficiency, and with the camels
sufficiently fresh to have reached the Nile on 7th or 8th January had
it pressed on.The more urgent news that reached Lord Wolseley after
its departure would have justified the despatch of a messenger to urge
it to press on at all costs to Metemmah.In such a manner would a
Havelock or Outram have acted, yet the garrison of the Lucknow
Residency was in no more desperate case than Gordon at Khartoum.It does not need to be a professor of a military academy to declare
that, unless something is risked in war, and especially wars such as
England has had to wage against superior numbers in the East, there
will never be any successful rescues of distressed garrisons.Lord
Wolseley would risk nothing in the advance from Korti to Metemmah,
whence his advance guard did not reach the latter place till the 20th,
instead of the 7th of January.His lieutenant and representative, Sir
Charles Wilson, would not risk anything on the 21st January, whence
none of the steamers appeared at Khartoum until late on the 27th, when
all was over.Each of these statements cannot be impeached, and if so,
the conclusion seems inevitable that in the first and highest degree
Lord Wolseley was alone responsible for the failure to reach Khartoum
in time, and that in a very minor degree Sir Charles Wilson might be
considered blameworthy for not having sent off one of the steamers
with a small reinforcement to Khartoum on the 21st January, before
even he allowed Cassim el Mousse to take any part in the attack on
Metemmah.He could not have done this himself, but he would have had
no difficulty in finding a substitute.When, however, there were
others far more blameworthy, it seems almost unjust to a gallant
officer to say that by a desperate effort he might at the very last
moment have snatched the chestnuts out of the fire, and converted the
most ignominious failure in the military annals of this country into a
creditable success.*       *       *       *       *

The tragic end at Khartoum was not an inappropriate conclusion for the
career of Charles Gordon, whose life had been far removed from the
ordinary experiences of mankind.No man who ever lived was called upon
to deal with a greater number of difficult military and
administrative problems, and to find the solution for them with such
inadequate means and inferior troops and subordinates.In the Crimea
he showed as a very young man the spirit, discernment, energy, and
regard for detail which were his characteristics through life.Those
qualities enabled him to achieve in China military exploits which in
their way have never been surpassed.The marvellous skill, confidence,
and vigilance with which he supplied the shortcomings of his troops,
and provided for the wants of a large population at Khartoum for the
better part of a year, showed that, as a military leader, he was still
the same gifted captain who had crushed the Taeping rebellion twenty
years before.What he did for the Soudan and its people during six
years' residence, at a personal sacrifice that never can be
appreciated, has been told at length; but pages of rhetoric would not
give as perfect a picture as the spontaneous cry of the blacks: "If we
only had a governor like Gordon Pasha, then the country would indeed
be contented.""Such examples are fruitful in the future," said Mr Gladstone in the
House of Commons; and it is as a perfect model of all that was good,
brave, and true that Gordon will be enshrined in the memory of the
great English nation which he really died for, and whose honour was
dearer to him than his life.England may well feel proud of having
produced so noble and so unapproachable a hero.She has had, and she
will have again, soldiers as brave, as thoughtful, as prudent, and as
successful as Gordon.She has had, and she will have again, servants
of the same public spirit, with the same intense desire that not a
spot should sully the national honour.But although this breed is not
extinct, there will never be another Gordon.The circumstances that
produced him were exceptional; the opportunities that offered
themselves for the demonstration of his greatness can never fall to
the lot of another; and even if by some miraculous combination the man
and the occasions arose, the hero, unlike Gordon, would be spoilt by
his own success and public applause.But the qualities which made
Gordon superior not only to all his contemporaries, but to all the
temptations and weaknesses of success, are attainable; and the student
of his life will find that the guiding star he always kept before him
was the duty he owed his country.In that respect, above all others,
he has left future generations of his countrymen a great example._Abbas_, steamer, ii.144;

things."The lady cast her eyes over the page, and laughed heartily.Presently
she said, "Here is a very curious anecdote, which I will read you; but
first I must explain to you what a sounding-board is."In old fashioned churches, there used to hang, directly over the
pulpit, a large, round board, like the top of a table, which, it was
thought, assisted the minister's voice to be heard by all the
congregation.I can remember, when I was a child, going to visit my
grandmother, and accompanying her to church, where there was a
sounding-board.I worried, through the whole service, for fear it would
fall on the minister's head and kill him."There was once an eminent clergyman by the name of Casaubon, who kept
in his family a tame monkey, of which he was very fond.This animal,
which was allowed its liberty, liked to follow the minister, when he
went out, but on the Sabbath was usually shut up till his owner was out
of sight, on his way to church."But one Sabbath morning, when the clergyman, taking his sermon under
his arm, went out, the monkey followed him unobserved, and watching the
opportunity while his master was speaking to a gentleman on the steps,
ran up at the back of the pulpit, and jumped upon the sounding-board."Here he gravely seated himself, looking round in a knowing manner on
the congregation, who were greatly amused at so strange a spectacle."The services proceeded as usual, while the monkey, who evidently much
enjoyed the sight of so many people, occasionally peeped over the
sounding-board, to observe the movements of his master, who was
unconscious of his presence."When the sermon commenced, many little forms were convulsed with
laughter, which conduct so shocked the good pastor, that he thought it
his duty to administer a reproof, which he did with considerable action
of his hands and arms."The monkey, who had now become familiar with the scene, imitated every
motion, until at last a scarcely suppressed smile appeared upon the
countenance of most of the audience.This occurred, too, in one of the
most solemn passages in the discourse; and so horrible did the levity
appear to the good minister, that he launched forth into violent rebuke,
every word being enforced by great energy of action."All this time, the little fellow overhead mimicked every movement with
ardor and exactness."The audience, witnessing this apparent competition between the good man
and his monkey, could no longer retain the least appearance of
composure, and burst into roars of laughter, in the midst of which one
of the congregation kindly relieved the horror of the pastor at the
irreverence and impiety of his flock, by pointing out the cause of the
merriment."Casting his eyes upward, the minister could just discern the animal
standing on the end of the sounding-board, and gesturing with all his
might, when he found it difficult to control himself, though highly
exasperated at the occurrence.He gave directions to have the monkey
removed, and sat down to compose himself, and allow his congregation to
recover their equanimity while the order was being obeyed."CHAPTER V.

JACKO IN THE PANTRY.In his frequent visits to the stable, Jacko amused himself by catching
mice that crept out to pick up the corn.The servants, having noticed his skill, thought they would turn it to
good account, and having been troubled with mice in the pantry,
determined to take advantage of the absence of Mrs.Lee on a journey,
and shut the monkey up in it.So, one evening, they took him out of his
comfortable bed, and chained him up in the larder, having removed every
thing except some jam pots, which they thought out of his reach, and
well secured with bladder stretched over the top.Poor Jacko was evidently much astonished, and quite indignant, at this
treatment, but presently consoled himself by jumping into a soup
tureen, where he fell sound asleep, while the mice scampered all over
the place.As soon as it was dawn, the mice retired to their holes.Jacko awoke
shivering with cold, stretched himself, and then, pushing the soup
tureen from the shelf, broke it to pieces.After this achievement, he
began to look about for something to eat, when he spied the jam pots on
the upper shelf."There is something good," he thought, smelling them.His sharp teeth soon worked an entrance, when the treasured jams, plums,
raspberry, strawberry, candied apricots, the pride and care of the cook,
disappeared in an unaccountably short time.At last, his appetite for sweets was satisfied, and coiling his tail in
a corner, he lay quietly awaiting the servant's coming to take him out.Presently he heard the door cautiously open, when the chamber girl gave
a scream of horror as she saw the elegant China dish broken into a
thousand bits, and lying scattered on the floor.She ran in haste to summon Hepsy and the nurse, her heart misgiving her
that this was not the end of the calamity.They easily removed Jacko,
who began already to experience the sad effects of overloading his
stomach, and then found, with alarm and grief, the damage he had done.For several days the monkey did not recover from the effects of his
excess.He was never shut up again in the pantry.Lee returned she blamed the servants for trying such an
experiment in her absence.Jacko was now well, and ready for some new
mischief; and Minnie, who heard a ludicrous account of the story,
laughed till she cried.She repeated it, in great glee, to her father, who looked very grave as
he said, "We think a sea voyage would do the troublesome fellow good;
but you shall have a Canary or a pair of Java sparrows instead.""Don't you know any stories of good monkeys, father?""I don't recollect any at this moment, my dear; but I will see whether I
can find any for you."He opened the book, and then asked,--

"Did you know, Minnie, that almost all monkeys have bags or pouches in
their cheeks, the skin of which is loose, and when empty makes the
animal look wrinkled?""No, sir; I never heard about it."He puts his food in them, and keeps it there
till he wishes to devour it."There are some kinds, too, that have what is called prehensile tails;
that is, tails by which they can hang themselves to the limb of a tree,
and which they use with nearly as much ease as they can their hands.The
facility which this affords them for moving about quickly among the
branches of trees is astonishing.The firmness of the grasp which it
makes is very surprising; for if it winds a single coil around a branch,
it is quite sufficient, not only to support its weight, but to enable it
to swing in such a manner as to gain a fresh hold with its feet.""I'm sure, father," eagerly cried Minnie, "that Jacko has a prehensile
tail, for I have often seen him swing from the ladder which goes up the
hay mow."But here is an
account of an Indian monkey, of a light grayish yellow color, with black
hands and feet.The face is black, with a violet tinge.This is called
Hoonuman, and is much venerated by the Hindoos.They believe it to be
one of the animals into which the souls of their friends pass at death.If one of these monkeys is killed, the murderer is instantly put to
death; and, thus protected, they become a great nuisance, and destroy
great quantities of fruit.But in South America, monkeys are killed by
the natives as game, for the sake of the flesh.Absolute necessity alone
would compel us to eat them.A great naturalist named Humboldt tells us
that their manner of cooking them is especially disgusting.They are
raised a foot from the ground, and bent into a sitting position, in
which they greatly resemble a child, and are roasted in that manner.A
hand and arm of a monkey, roasted in this way, are exhibited in a museum
in Paris.""Monkeys have a curious way of introducing their tails into the fissures
or hollows of trees, for the purpose of hooking out eggs and other
substances.On approaching a spot where there is a supply of food, they
do not alight at once, but take a survey of the neighborhood, a general
cry being kept up by the party."One afternoon, Minnie ran out of breath to the parlor."Mamma," she
exclaimed, "cook says monkeys are real cruel in their families."I suppose, my dear," she responded, "that there is a
difference of disposition among them.I have heard that they are very
fond of their young, and that, when threatened with danger, they mount
them on their back, or clasp them to their breast with great affection."But I saw lately an anecdote of the cruelty of a monkey to his wife,
and if I can find the book, I will read it to you.""There is an animal called the fair monkey, which, though the most
beautiful of its tribe, is gloomy and cruel.One of these, which, from
its extreme beauty and apparent gentleness, was allowed to ramble at
liberty over a ship, soon became a great favorite with the crew, and in
order to make him perfectly happy, as they imagined, they procured him a
wife."For some weeks, he was a devoted husband, and showed her every
attention and respect.He then grew cool, and began to use her with much
cruelty."One day, the crew noticed that he treated her with more kindness than
usual, but did not suspect the wicked scheme he had in mind.At last,
after winning her favor anew, he persuaded her to go aloft with him, and
drew her attention to an object in the distance, when he suddenly gave
her a push, which threw her into the sea."This cruel act seemed to afford him much gratification, for he
descended in high spirits.""I should think they would have punished him," said Minnie, with great
indignation.At any rate, it proves that beauty is by no
means always to be depended upon."Lee then took her sewing, but Minnie plead so earnestly for one
more story, a good long one, that her mother, who loved to gratify her,
complied, and read the account which I shall give you in closing this
chapter on Minnie's pet monkey."A gentleman, returning from India, brought a monkey, which he presented
to his wife.She called it Sprite, and soon became very fond of it."Sprite was very fond of beetles, and also of spiders, and his mistress
used sometimes to hold his chain, lengthened by a string, and make him
run up the curtains, and clear out the cobwebs for the housekeeper."On one occasion, he watched his opportunity, and snatching the chain,
ran off, and was soon seated on the top of a cottage, grinning and
chattering to the assembled crowd of schoolboys, as much as to say,
'Catch me if you can.'He got the whole town in an uproar, but finally
leaped over every thing, dragging his chain after him, and nestled
himself in his own bed, where he lay with his eyes closed, his mouth
open, his sides ready to burst with his running."Another time, the little fellow got loose, but remembering his former
experience, only stole into the shed, where he tried his hand at
cleaning knives.He did not succeed very well in this, however, for the
handle was the part he attempted to polish, and, cutting his fingers, he
relinquished the sport."Resolved not to be defeated, he next set to work to clean the shoes and
boots, a row of which were awaiting the boy.But Sprite, not remembering
all the steps of the performance, first covered the entire shoe, sole
and all, with the blacking, and then emptied the rest of the Day &
Martin into it, nearly filling it with the precious fluid.His coat was
a nice mess for some days after."One morning, when the servants returned to the kitchen, they found
Sprite had taken all the kitchen candlesticks out of the cupboard, and
arranged them on the fender, as he had once seen done.As soon as he
heard the servants returning, he ran to his basket, and tried to look as
though nothing had happened."Sprite was exceedingly fond of a bath.Occasionally a bowl of water was
given him, when he would cunningly try the temperature by putting in his
finger, after which he gradually stepped in, first one foot, then the
other, till he was comfortably seated.Then he took the soap and rubbed
himself all over.Having made a dreadful splashing all around, he jumped
out and ran to the fire, shivering.If any body laughed at him during
this performance, he made threatening gestures, chattering with all his
might to show his displeasure, and sometimes he splashed water all over
them.As he was brought from a
very warm climate, he often suffered exceedingly, in winter, from the
cold."The cooking was done by a large fire on the open hearth, and as his
basket, where he slept, was in one corner of the kitchen, before morning
he frequently awoke shivering and blue.The cook was in the habit of
making the fire, and then returning to her room to finish her toilet."One morning, having lighted the pile of kindlings as usual, she hung on
the tea-kettle and went out, shutting the door carefully behind her."Sprite thought this a fine opportunity to warm himself.He jumped from
his basket, ran to the hearth, and took the lid of the kettle off.Cautiously touching the water with the tip of his finger, he found it
just the right heat for a bath, and sprang in, sitting down, leaving
only his head above the water."This he found exceedingly comfortable for a time; but soon the water
began to grow hot.He rose, but the air outside was so cold, he quickly
sat down again.He did this several times, and would, no doubt, have
been boiled to death, and become a martyr to his own want of pluck and
firmness in action, had it not been for the timely return of the cook,
who, seeing him sitting there almost lifeless, seized him by the head
and pulled him out."He was rolled in blankets, and laid in his basket, where he soon
recovered, and, it is to be hoped, learned a lesson from this hot
experience, not to take a bath when the water is on the fire."When Minnie was nine years of age, she accompanied her parents to a
menagerie, and there, among other animals, she saw a baboon.She was
greatly excited by his curious, uncouth manoeuvres, asking twenty
questions about him, without giving her father time to answer.On their
way home, she inquired,--

"Are baboons one kind of monkeys, father?""Yes, my daughter; and a more disagreeable, disgusting animal I cannot
conceive of.""I hope you are not wishing for a baboon to add to your pets," added her
mother, laughing."I don't believe Jacko would get along with that great fellow at all,"
answered the child."But, father, will you please tell me something
more about the curious animals?"The conversation was here interrupted by seeing that a carriage had
stopped just in front of their own, and that quite a crowd had gathered
about some person who seemed to be hurt.Minnie's sympathies were alive in an instant.She begged her father to
get out, as possibly he might be of some use.The driver stopped of his own accord, and inquired what had happened,
and then they saw that it was a spaniel that was hurt.He had been in
the road, and not getting out of the way quick enough, the wheel had
gone over his body.The young lady who was in the buggy was greatly distressed, from which
Minnie argued that she was kind to animals, and that they should like
her.The owner of the dog held the poor creature in her arms, though it
seemed to be in convulsions, and wept bitterly as she found it must die.Lee, to please his little daughter, waited a few minutes; but he
found her getting so much excited over the suffering animal, he gave
John orders to proceed.During the rest of the drive, she could talk of nothing else, wondering
whether the spaniel was alive now, or whether the young man in the buggy
paid for hurting it.The next day, however, having made up her mind that the poor creature
must be dead, and his sufferings ended, and having given Tiney many
admonitions to keep out of the road when carriages were passing, her
thoughts turned once more to the baboon.Lee found in his library a book which gave a short account of the
animal, which he read to her."The baboon is of the monkey tribe, notwithstanding its long, dog-like
head, flat, compressed cheeks, and strong and projecting teeth.The form
and position of the eyes, combined with the similarity of the arms and
hands, give to these creatures a resemblance to humanity as striking as
it is disgusting.""Then follows an account," the gentleman went on, "of the peculiarities
of different kinds of baboons, which you would not understand.""But can't you tell me something about them yourself, father?""I know very little about the creatures, my dear; but I have read that
they are exceedingly strong, and of a fiery, vicious temper."They can never be wholly tamed, and it is only while restraint of the
severest kind is used, that they can be governed at all.If left to
their own will, their savage nature resumes its sway, and their actions
are cruel, destructive, and disgusting.""I saw the man at the menagerie giving them apples," said Minnie; "but
he did not give them any meat all the time I was there.""No; they subsist exclusively on fruits, seeds, and other vegetable
matter.In the countries where they live, especially near the Cape of
Good Hope, the inhabitants chase them with dogs and guns in order to
destroy them, on account of the ravages they commit in the fields and
gardens.It is said that they make a very obstinate resistance to the
dogs, and often have fierce battles with them; but they greatly fear the
gun."As the baboon grows older, instead of becoming better, his rage
increases, so that the slightest cause will provoke him to terrible
fury.""Why, Minnie, in order to satisfy you, any one must become a walking
encyclopaedia."Why, they must have something to eat, and how are they to get it unless
they go into gardens?""I rather think I should soon convince them they
were not to enter my garden," he said, emphatically."But seriously,
they descend in vast numbers upon the orchards of fruit, destroying, in
a few hours, the work of months, or even of years.In these excursions,
they move on a concerted plan, placing sentinels on commanding spots, to
give notice of the approach of an enemy.As soon as he perceives danger,
the sentinel gives a loud yell, and then the whole troop rush away with
the greatest speed, cramming the fruit which they have gathered into
their cheek pouches."Minnie looked so much disappointed when he ceased speaking, that her
mother said, "I read somewhere an account of a baboon that was named
Kees, who was the best of his kind that I ever heard of.""Yes, that was quite an interesting story, if you can call it to mind,"
said the gentleman, rising."It was in a book of travels in Africa," the lady went on."The
traveller, whose name was Le Vaillant, took Kees through all his
journey, and the creature really made himself very useful.As a
sentinel, he was better than any of the dogs.Indeed, so quick was his
sense of danger, that he often gave notice of the approach of beasts of
prey, when every thing was apparently secure."There was another way in which Kees made himself useful.Whenever they
came across any fruits or roots with which the Hottentots were
unacquainted, they waited to see whether Kees would taste them.If he
threw them down, the traveller concluded they were poisonous or
disagreeable, and left them untasted."Le Vaillant used to hunt, and frequently took Kees with him on these
excursions.The poor fellow understood the preparations making for the
sport, and when his master signified his consent that he should go, he
showed his joy in the most lively manner.On the way, he would dance
about, and then run up into the trees to search for gum, of which he was
very fond."I recall one amusing trick of Kees," said the lady, laughing, "which
pleased me much when I read it.He sometimes found honey in the hollows
of trees, and also a kind of root of which he was very fond, both of
which his master insisted on sharing with him.On such occasions, he
would run away with his treasure, or hide it in his pouches, or eat it
as fast as possible, before Le Vaillant could have time to reach him."These roots were very difficult to pull from the ground.Kees' manner
of doing it was this.He would seize the top of the root with his strong
teeth, and then, planting himself firmly against the sod, drew himself
gradually back, which forced it from the earth.If it proved stubborn,
while he still held it in his teeth he threw himself heels over head,
which gave such a concussion to the root that it never failed to come
out."Another habit that Kees had was very curious.He sometimes grew tired
with the long marches, and then he would jump on the back of one of the
dogs, and oblige it to carry him whole hours.At last the dogs grew
weary of this, and one of them determined not to be pressed into
service.As soon as Kees leaped on
his back, he stood still, and let the train pass without moving from the
spot.Kees sat quiet, determined that the dog should carry him, until
the party were almost out of sight, and then they both ran in great
haste to overtake their master."Kees established a kind of authority over the dogs.They were
accustomed to his voice, and in general obeyed without hesitation the
slightest motions by which he communicated his orders, taking their
places about the tent or carriage, as he directed them.If any of them
came too near him when he was eating, he gave them a box on the ear,
and thus compelled them to retire to a respectful distance.""Why, mother, I think Kees was a very good animal, indeed," said Minnie,
with considerable warmth."I have told you the best traits of his character," she answered,
smiling."He was, greatly to his master's sorrow, an incurable thief.He
could not be left alone for a moment with any kind of food.He
understood perfectly how to loose the strings of a basket, or to take
the cork from a bottle.He was very fond of milk, and would drink it
whenever he had a chance.He was whipped repeatedly for these
misdemeanors, but the punishment did him no good."Le Vaillant was accustomed to have eggs for his breakfast; but his
servants complained one morning there were none to be had.Whenever any
thing was amiss, the fault was always laid to Kees, who, indeed,
generally deserved it."The next morning, hearing the cackling of a hen, he started for the
place; but found Kees had been before him, and nothing remained but the
broken shell.Having caught him in his pilfering, his master gave him a
severe beating; but he was soon at his old habit again, and the
gentleman was obliged to train one of his dogs to run for the egg as
soon as it was laid, before he could enjoy his favorite repast."One day, Le Vaillant was eating his dinner, when he heard the voice of
a bird, with which he was not acquainted.Leaving the beans he had
carefully prepared for himself on his plate, he seized his gun, and ran
out of the tent.In a short time he returned, with the bird in his hand,
but found not a bean left, and Kees missing."When he had been stealing, the baboon often staid out of sight for some
hours; but, this time, he hid himself for several days.They searched
every where for him, but in vain, till his master feared he had really
deserted them.On the third day, one of the men, who had gone to a
distance for water, saw him hiding in a tree.Le Vaillant went out and
spoke to him, but he knew he had deserved punishment, and he would not
come down; so that, at last, his master had to go up the tree and take
him.""No; he was forgiven that time, as he seemed so penitent.There is only
one thing more I can remember about him.An officer who was visiting Le
Vaillant, wishing to try the affection of the baboon for his master,
pretended to strike him.Kees flew into a violent rage, and from that
time could never endure the sight of the officer.If he only saw him at
a distance, he ground his teeth, and used every endeavor to fly at him;
and had he not been chained, he would speedily have revenged the
insult."*       *       *       *       *

"You really must join the Army," said the stern old Puritan to the Lord
Protector."The fate of this fair realm of England depends upon the
promptness with which you assume command."He had laid aside his buff doublet, and had
donned a coat of a thinner material.His sword also was gone, and
hanging by his side was a pair of double spy-glasses--new in those
days--new in very deed."I cannot go," cried the Lord Protector at last, "it would be too great
a sacrifice.""You said not that," pursued IRETON--for it was he--"when you called
upon CHARLES to lose his head.""But in this case, good sooth, I would wish a head to be won, or the
victory to be by a head;" and then the Uncrowned King laughed long and
heartily, as was his wont when some jest tickled him."This is no matter for merriment," exclaimed IRETON sternly."OLIVER,
you are playing the fool.You are sacrificing for pleasure, business,
duty.""Well, I cannot help it," was the response."But mind you, IRETON, it
shall be the last time.""What is it that attracts you so strongly?What is the pleasure that
lures you away from the path of duty?""I will tell you, and then you will pity, perchance forgive me.To-day

SITTING ON OUR SENATE.SIR,--It struck me that the best and simplest way of finding out what
were the intentions of the Government with regard to the veto of the
Peers was to write and ask each individual Member his opinion on the
subject.Accordingly I have done so, and it seems to me that there is a
vast amount of significance in the nature of the replies I have
received, to anyone capable of reading between the lines; or, as most of
the communications only extended to a single line, let us say to anyone
capable of reading beyond the full-stop.Lord ROSEBERY'S Secretary, for
example, writes that "the Prime Minister is at present out of town"--_at
present_, you see, but obviously on the point of coming back, in order
to grapple with my letter and the question generally.Sir WILLIAM
HARCOURT, his Secretary, writes, "is at Wiesbaden, but upon his return
your communication will no doubt receive his attention"--_receive his
attention_, an ominous phrase for the Peers, who seem hardly to realise
that between them and ruin there is only the distance from Wiesbaden to
Downing Street.MORLEY "sees no reason to alter his published
opinion on the subject"--_alter_, how readily, by the prefixing of a
single letter, that word becomes _halter_!I was unable to effect
personal service of my letter on the ATTORNEY-GENERAL, possibly because
I called at his chambers during the Long Vacation; but the fact that a
card should have been attached to his door bearing the words "Back at 2
P.M."surely indicates that Sir JOHN RIGBY will _back up_ his leaders in
any approaching attack on the fortress of feudalism!Then surely the
circumstance that the other Ministers to whom my letters were addressed
_have not as yet sent any answer_ shows how seriously they regard the
situation, and how disinclined they are to commit themselves to a too
hasty reply!In fact, the outlook for the House of Lords, judging from
these Ministerial communications, is decidedly gloomy, and I am inclined
to think that an Autumn Session devoted to abolishing it is a most
probable eventuality.Yours,

  FUSSY-CUSS EXSPECTANS.SIR,--The real way of dealing with the Lords is as follows.The next
time that they want to meet, cut off their gas and water!Tell the
butcher and baker _not_ to call at the House for orders, and dismiss the
charwomen who dust their bloated benches.If _this_ doesn't bring them
to reason, nothing will.HIGH-MINDED DEMOCRAT.*       *       *       *       *

attempt to make such a thoroughly useless, and, indeed, revolutionary
discovery.It is enough to turn anyone into a democrat at once.And what
was Lord SALISBURY, as a Conservative, doing, in allowing such a subject
to be mooted at Oxford?Why did he not at once turn the new gas off at
the meter?*       *       *       *       *

OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.[Illustration]

From HENRY SOTHERAN & CO.(so a worthy Baronite reports) comes a second
edition of _Game Birds and Shooting Sketches_, by JOHN GUILLE MILLAIS.Every sportsman who is something more than a mere bird-killer ought to
buy this beautiful book.MILLAIS' drawings are wonderfully delicate,
and, so far as I can judge, remarkably accurate.He has a fine touch for
plumage, and renders with extraordinary success the bold and resolute
bearing of the British game-bird in the privacy of his own peculiar
haunts.I am glad the public have shown themselves sufficiently
appreciative to warrant Mr.MILLAIS in putting forth a second edition of
a book which is the beautiful and artistic result of very many days of
patient and careful observation.By the way, there is an illustration of
a Blackcock Tournament, which is, for knock-about primitive humour, as
good as a pantomime rally.Are we in future to
spell Capercailzie with an extra l in place of the z, as Mr.Surely it is rather wanton thus to annihilate the pride of
the sportsman who knew what was what, and who never pronounced the z. If
you take away the z you take away all merit from him.MILLAIS will consider the matter in his third edition.*       *       *       *       *

  The people will swear that I don't play the game,
    Oh willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!My spirits are low and my scores are not high,
  But day after day we've soaked turf and grey sky,
  And I shan't have a chance till the wickets get dry,
    Oh willow, wet-willow, wet-willow!!!"*       *       *       *       *

ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P._House of Commons, Monday, August 20._--ASHMEAD-BARTLETT (Knight) is the
CASABIANCA of Front Opposition Bench.Now his
opportunity; will show jealous colleagues, watchful House, and
interested country, how a party should be led.Had an innings on
Saturday, when, in favourite character of Dompter of British and other
Lions, he worried Under Secretaries for Foreign Affairs and the
Colonies.In fact what happened seems to
confirm quaint theory SARK advances.Says he believes those two astute young men, EDWARD GREY and SYDNEY
BUXTON, "control" the Sheffield Knight.Moreover, things are managed so well both at
Foreign Office and Colonial Office that they have no opportunity of
distinguishing themselves.The regular representatives on the Front
Opposition Bench of Foreign Affairs and Colonies say nothing;
patriotically acquiescent in management of concerns in respect of which
it is the high tradition of English statesmanship that the political
game shall not be played.In such circumstances no opening for able
young men.But, suppose they could induce some blatant, irresponsible
person, persistently to put groundless questions, and make insinuations
derogatory to the character of British statesmen at home and British
officials abroad?Then they step in, and, amid applause on both sides of
House, knock over the intruder.Sort of game of House of Commons
nine-pins.Nine-pin doesn't care so that it's noticed; admirable
practice for young Parliamentary Hands._Invaluable to Budding Statesmen._]

This is SARK'S suggestion of explanation of phenomenon.Fancy much
simpler one might be found.To-night BARTLETT-ELLIS in better luck.Turns upon ATTORNEY-GENERAL; darkly hints that escape of JABEZ was a
put-up job, of which Law Officers of the Crown might, an' they would,
disclose some interesting particulars.RIGBY, who, when he bends his
step towards House of Commons, seems to leave all his shrewdness and
knowledge of the world in his chambers, rose to the fly; played
BASHMEAD-ARTLETT'S obvious game by getting angry, and delivering long
speech whilst progress of votes, hitherto going on swimmingly, was
arrested for fully an hour._Business done._--Supply voted with both hands._Tuesday._--A precious sight, one worthy of the painter's or sculptor's
art, to see majestic figure of SQUIRE OF MALWOOD standing between House
of Lords and imminent destruction.Irish members and Radicals opposite
have sworn to have blood of the Peers.SAGE OF QUEEN ANNE'S GATE is
taking the waters elsewhere.Sat up
all last night, the Radicals trying to get at the Lords by the kitchen
entrance; SQUIRE withstanding them till four o'clock in the morning.Education Vote on, involving expenditure of six
millions and welfare of innumerable children.Afterwards the Post Office
Vote, upon which the Postmaster-General, ST.ARNOLD-LE-GRAND, endeavours
to reply to HENNIKER-HEATON without betraying consciousness of bodily
existence of such a person.These matters of great and abiding interest;
but only few members present to discuss them.The rest waiting outside
till the lists are cleared and battle rages once more round citadel of
the Lords sullenly sentineled by detachment from the Treasury Bench.When engagement reopened SQUIRE gone for his holiday trip, postponed by
the all-night sitting, JOHN MORLEY on guard.Breaks force of assault by
protest that the time is inopportune.By-and-by the Lords shall be
handed over to tender mercies of gentlemen below gangway.Not just now,
and not in this particular way.CHIEF SECRETARY remembers famous case of
absentee landlord not to be intimidated by the shooting of his agent.So
Lords, he urges, not to be properly punished for throwing out Evicted
Tenants Bill by having the salaries of the charwomen docked, and BLACK
ROD turned out to beg his bread.Radicals at least not to be denied satisfaction of division.Salaries
of House of Lords staff secured for another year by narrow majority
of 31._Wednesday._--The SQUIRE OF MALWOOD at last got off for his well-earned
holiday.Carries with him consciousness of having done supremely well
amid difficulties of peculiar complication.As JOSEPH in flush of
unexpected and still unexplained frankness testified, the Session will
in its accomplished work beat the record of any in modern times.The
SQUIRE been admirably backed by a rare team of colleagues; but in House
of Commons everything depends on the Leader.Had the Session been a
failure, upon his head would have fallen obloquy.As it has been a
success, his be the praise."Well, good bye," said JOHN MORLEY, tears standing in his tender eyes as
he wrung the hand of the almost Lost Leader."But you know it's not all
over yet.What shall we do if WEIR comes
up on Second Reading?""Oh, dam WEIR," said the SQUIRE.For a moment thought a usually
equable temper had been ruffled by the almost continuous work of twenty
months, culminating in an all-night sitting.On reflection he saw that
the SQUIRE was merely adapting an engineering phrase, describing a
proceeding common enough on river courses.The only point on which
remark open to criticism is that it is tautological._Business done._--Appropriation Bill brought in._Thursday._--GEORGE NEWNES looked in just now; much the same as ever;
the same preoccupied, almost pensive look; a mind weighed down by
ever-multiplying circulation.Troubled with consideration of proposal
made to him to publish special edition of _Strand Magazine_ in tongue
understanded of the majority of the peoples of India.Has conquered
the English-speaking race from Chatham to Chattanooga, from Southampton
to Sydney.The poor Indian brings his annas, and begs a boon.Meanwhile one of the candidates for vacant Poet Laureateship has broken
out into elegiac verse."NEWNES," he exclaims,

  "NEWNES, noble hearted, shine, for ever shine;
  Though not of royal, yet of hallowed line."That sort of thing would make some men vain.There is no couplet to
parallel it since the famous one written by POPE on a place frequented
by a Sovereign whose death is notorious, a place where

  Great ANNA, whom three realms obey,
  Did sometimes counsel take and sometimes tea.The poet, whose volume bears the proudly humble pseudonym "A Village
Peasant," should look in at the House of Commons and continue his
studies.There are a good many of us here worth a poet's attention.SARK
says the thing is easy enough."Toss 'em off in no time," says he."There's the SQUIRE now, who has not lately referred to his Plantagenet
parentage.Apostrophising him in Committee on Evicted Tenants Bill one
might have said:--

  SQUIRE, noble hearted, shine, for ever shine;
  Though not of hallowed yet of royal line."_Business done._--Appropriation Bill read second time.Sir WILFRID LAWSON and others said "Dam."_Saturday._--Appropriation Bill read third time this morning.Prorogation served with five o'clock tea.said one of the House of Commons waiters loitering at the
gateway of Palace Yard and replying to inquiring visitor from the
country.[Illustration: THE IMPERIAL SHEFFIELD NINE-PIN.*       *       *       *       *

  To make sweet hay I was amazed to find
    You absolutely did not know the way,
  Though when you did, it seemed much to your mind

  We made sweet hay.But what will Mother say

[Transcriber's Note:

Alternative spellings retained.But since then they have been left to decay, to the silent sheep
and the screeching ravens, including doubtless that ghostly chough, in
whose shape the soul of King Arthur is believed still to revisit the
familiar scene.We did not see that notable bird--though we watched with interest two
tame and pretty specimens of its almost extinct species walking about
in a flower-garden in the village, and superstitiously cherished there.We were told that to this day no Cornishman likes to shoot a chough
or a raven.So they live and breed in peace among the twin ruins, and
scream contentedly to the noisy stream which dances down the rocky
hollow from Trevena, and leaps into the sea at Porth Hern--the "iron
gate," over against Tintagel.We thought we had seen everything, and come to an end, but at the hotel
we found a party who had just returned from visiting some sea-caves
beyond Tintagel, which they declared were "the finest things they had
found in Cornwall."It was a lovely calm day, and it was our last day.And, I think, the looser grows one's grasp of life, the greater is
one's longing to make the most of it, to see all we can see of this
wonderful, beautiful world.So, after a hasty meal, we found ourselves
once more down at Porth Hern, seeking a boat and man--alas!not John
Curgenven--under whose guidance we might brave the stormy deep.No sooner had we rounded the rock, than the baby
waves of the tiny bay grew into hills and valleys, among which our boat
went dancing up and down like a sea-gull!"Ay, there's some sea on, there always is here, but we'll be through it
presently," indifferently said the elder of the two boatmen; and plied
his oars, as, I think, only these Cornish boatmen can do, talking all
the while.He pointed out a slate quarry, only accessible from the sea,
unless the workmen liked to be let down by ropes, which sometimes had
to be done.We saw them moving about like black emmets among the clefts
of the rocks, and heard plainly above the sound of the sea the click
of their hammers.Strange, lonely, perilous work it must be, even in
summer.In winter--

"Oh, they're used to it; we're all used to it," said our man, who was
intelligent enough, though nothing equal to John Curgenven."Many a
time I've got sea-fowls' eggs on those rocks there," pointing to a
cliff which did not seem to hold footing for a fly.The
gentry buy them, and we're glad of the money.Dangerous?--yes, rather;
but one must earn one's bread, and it's not so bad when you take to it
young."Nevertheless, I think I shall never look at a collection of sea-birds'
eggs without a slight shudder, remembering those awful cliffs."Here you are, ladies, and the sea's down a bit, as I said.Hold on,
mate, the boat will go right into the cave."And before we knew what was happening, we found ourselves floated out
of daylight into darkness--very dark it seemed at first--and rocking
on a mass of heaving waters, shut in between two high walls, so narrow
that it seemed as if every heave would dash us in pieces against them;
while beyond was a dense blackness, from which one heard the beat of
the everlasting waves against a sort of tunnel, a stormy sea-grave from
which no one could ever hope to come out alive."I don't like this at all," said a small voice."Hadn't we better get out again?"But no sooner was this done than the third of the party longed to
return; and begged for "only five minutes" in that wonderful place,
compared to which Dolor Ugo, and the other Lizard caves, became as
nothing.Yet with its
terror was mingled an awful delight."Give me but five, nay, two
minutes more!""Very well, just as you choose," was the response of meek despair.The boatmen were told to row on into
daylight and sunshine--at least as much sunshine as the gigantic
overhanging cliffs permitted.And never, never, never in this world
shall I again behold that wonderful, mysterious sea-cave.But like all things incomplete, resigned, or lost, it has fixed itself
on my memory with an almost painful vividness.However, I promised not
to regret--not to say another word about it; and I will not.I did see
it, for just a glimpse; and that will serve.Two more pictures remain, the last gorgeous sunset, which I watched in
quiet solitude, sitting on a tombstone by Tintagel church--a building
dating from Saxon times, perched on the very edge of a lofty cliff,
and with a sea-view that reaches from Trevose Head on one side to Bude
Haven on the other.Also, our last long dreamy drive; in the mild
September sunshine, across the twenty-one miles of sparsely inhabited
country which lie between Tintagel and Launceston.In the midst of
it, on the top of a high flat of moorland, our driver turned round
and pointed with his whip to a long low mound, faintly visible about
half-a-mile off."There, ladies, that's King Arthur's grave."The third, at least, that we had either seen or heard of.These varied
records of the hero's last resting-place remind one of the three heads,
said to be still extant, of Oliver Cromwell, one when he was a little
boy, one as a young man, and the third as an old man.But after all my last and vividest recollection of King Arthur's
country is that wild sail--so wild that I wished I had taken it
alone--in the solitary boat, up and down the tossing waves in face of
Tintagel rock; the dark, iron-bound coast with its awful caves, the
bright sunshiny land, and ever-threatening sea.Just the region, in
short, which was likely to create a race like that which Arthurian
legend describes, full of passionate love and deadly hate, capable of
barbaric virtues, and equally barbaric crimes.An age in which the mere
idea of such a hero as that ideal knight

  "Who reverenced his conscience as his God:
  Whose glory was redressing human wrong:
  Who spake no slander, no, nor listened to it:
  Who loved one only, and who clave to her--"

rises over the blackness of darkness like a morning star.If Arthur could "come again"--perhaps in the person of one of the
descendants of a prince who was not unlike him, who lived and died
among us in this very nineteenth century--

  "Wearing the white flower of a blameless life--"

if this could be--what a blessing for Arthur's beloved England![Illustration: THE OLD POST-OFFICE, TREVENA.]L'ENVOI


Written more than a year after.The "old hen" and her chickens have
long been safe at home.A dense December fog creeps in everywhere,
choking and blinding, as I finish the history of those fifteen innocent
days, calm as autumn, and bright as spring, when we three took our
Unsentimental Journey together through Cornwall.Many a clever critic,
like Sir Charles Coldstream when he looked into the crater of Vesuvius,
may see "nothing in it"--a few kindly readers looking a little further,
may see a little more: probably the writer only sees the whole.But such as it is, let it stay--simple memorial of what Americans would
call "a good time," the sunshine of which may cast its brightness far
forward, even into that quiet time "when travelling days are done."LONDON:
  R. CLAY, SONS, AND TAYLOR,
  BREAD STREET HILL, E.C.But for Gord's sake get 'em
done as quick as you can.If you could manage to get done by Friday
and come down and help Easton on Saturday, it would be so much the
better.And when you do get a start on the decoratin', I shouldn't
take too much care over it, you know, if I was you, because we 'ad to
take the job for next to nothing or Mr Sweater would never 'ave 'ad it
done at all!'Nimrod now began to crawl about the house, snarling and grumbling at
everyone.he bellowed, 'you seem to
think this is a 'orspital.If some of you don't make a better show
than this, I'll 'ave to 'ave a Alteration!There's plenty of chaps
walkin' about doin' nothin' who'll be only too glad of a job!'He went into the scullery, where Crass was mixing some colour.'I'm not at all satisfied with the way
you're gettin' on with the work.You must push the chaps a bit more
than you're doin'.There's not enough being done, by a long way.We
shall lose money over this job before we're finished!'Crass--whose fat face had turned a ghastly green with fright--mumbled
something about getting on with it as fast as he could.'Well, you'll 'ave to make 'em move a bit quicker than this!'Misery
howled, 'or there'll 'ave to be a ALTERATION!'By an 'alteration' Crass understood that he might get the sack, or that
someone else might be put in charge of the job, and that would of
course reduce him to the ranks and do away with his chance of being
kept on longer than the others.He determined to try to ingratiate
himself with Hunter and appease his wrath by sacrificing someone else.He glanced cautiously into the kitchen and up the passage and then,
lowering his voice, he said:

'They all shapes pretty well, except Newman.I would 'ave told you
about 'im before, but I thought I'd give 'im a fair chance.I've spoke
to 'im several times myself about not doin' enough, but it don't seem
to make no difference.''I've 'ad me eye on 'im meself for some time,' replied Nimrod in the
same tone.'Anybody would think the work was goin' to be sent to a
Exhibition, the way 'e messes about with it, rubbing it with glasspaper
and stopping up every little crack!I can't understand where 'e gets
all the glasspaper FROM.''I know for a fact that
'e bought two 'a'penny sheets of it, last week out of 'is own money!''Oh, 'e did, did 'e?'He went into the hall, where he remained alone for a considerable time,
brooding.At last, with the manner of one who has resolved on a
certain course of action, he turned and entered the room where Philpot
and Harlow were working.'You both get sevenpence an hour, don't you?''I've never worked under price yet,' added Harlow.'Well, of course you can please yourselves,' Hunter continued, 'but
after this week we've decided not to pay more than six and a half.Things is cut so fine nowadays that we can't afford to go on payin'
sevenpence any longer.You can work up till tomorrow night on the old
terms, but if you're not willin' to accept six and a half you needn't
come on Saturday morning.Harlow and Philpot were both too much astonished to say anything in
reply to this cheerful announcement, and Hunter, with the final remark,
'You can think it over,' left them and went to deliver the same
ultimatum to all the other full-price men, who took it in the same way
as Philpot and Harlow had done.Crass and Owen were the only two whose
wages were not reduced.It will be remembered that Newman was one of those who were already
working for the reduced rate.Misery found him alone in one of the
upper rooms, to which he was giving the final coat.The woodwork of the cupboard be was doing was in a rather
damaged condition, and he was facing up the dents with white-lead putty
before painting it.He knew quite well that Hunter objected to any but
very large holes or cracks being stopped, and yet somehow  or other he
could not scamp the work to the extent that he was ordered to; and so,
almost by stealth, he was in the habit of doing it--not properly but as
well as he dared.He even went to the length of occasionally buying a
few sheets of glasspaper with his own money, as Crass had told Hunter.When the latter came into the room he stood with a sneer on his face,
watching Newman for about five minutes before he spoke.The workman
became very nervous and awkward under this scrutiny.'You can make out yer time-sheet and come to the office for yer money
at five o'clock,' said Nimrod at last.'We shan't require your
valuable services no more after tonight.''Oh, it's not wot you've DONE,' replied Misery.'It's wot you've not
done.You've not done enough, that's all!'And
without further parley he turned and went out.Newman stood in the darkening room feeling as if his heart had turned
to lead.There rose before his mind the picture of his home and
family.He could see them as they were at this very moment, the wife
probably just beginning to prepare the evening meal, and the children
setting the cups and saucers and other things on the kitchen table--a
noisy work, enlivened with many a frolic and childish dispute.Even
the two-year-old baby insisted on helping, although she always put
everything in the wrong place and made all sorts of funny mistakes.They had all been so happy lately because they knew that he had work
that would last till nearly Christmas--if not longer.And now this had
happened--to plunge them back into the abyss of wretchedness from which
they had so recently escaped.They still owed several weeks' rent, and
were already so much in debt to the baker and the grocer that it was
hopeless to expect any further credit.said Newman, realizing the almost utter hopelessness of the
chance of obtaining another 'job' and unconsciously speaking aloud.Having accomplished the objects of his visit, Hunter shortly afterwards
departed, possibly congratulating himself that he had not been hiding
his light under a bushel, but that he had set it upon a candlestick and
given light unto all that were within that house.As soon as they knew that he was gone, the men began to gather into
little groups, but in a little while they nearly all found themselves
in the kitchen, discussing the reduction.Sawkins and the other
'lightweights' remained at their work.Some of them got only fourpence
halfpenny--Sawkins was paid fivepence--so none of these were affected
by the change.The other two fresh hands--the journeymen--joined the
crowd in the kitchen, being anxious to conceal the fact that they had
agreed to accept the reduced rate before being 'taken on'.Owen also
was there, having heard the news from Philpot.At first several of them spoke of
'chucking up', at once; but others were more prudent, for they knew
that if they did leave there were dozens of others who would be eager
to take their places.'After all, you know,' said Slyme, who had--stowed away somewhere at
the back of his head--an idea of presently starting business on his own
account: he was only waiting until he had saved enough money, 'after
all, there's something in what 'Unter says.It's very 'ard to get a
fair price for work nowadays.'And who the bloody
'ell is it cuts 'em?Why, sich b--rs as 'Unter and Rushton!If this
firm 'adn't cut this job so fine, some other firm would 'ave 'ad it for
more money.Rushton's cuttin' it fine didn't MAKE this job, did it?It would 'ave been done just the same if they 'adn't tendered for it at
all!The only difference is that we should 'ave been workin' for some
other master.''I don't believe the bloody job's cut fine at all!''Rushton is a pal of Sweater's and they're both members of the Town
Council.''That may be,' replied Slyme; 'but all the same I believe Sweater got
several other prices besides Rushton's--friend or no friend; and you
can't blame 'im: it's only business.But pr'aps Rushton got the
preference--Sweater may 'ave told 'im the others' prices.''Yes, and a bloody fine lot of prices they was, too, if the truth was
known!''There was six other firms after this job to my
knowledge--Pushem and Sloggem, Bluffum and Doemdown, Dodger and
Scampit, Snatcham and Graball, Smeeriton and Leavit, Makehaste and
Sloggitt, and Gord only knows 'ow many more.'He looked so white and upset
that the others involuntarily paused in their conversation.'Well, what do YOU think of it?''Why, didn't 'Unter tell you?'cried several voices, whose owners
looked suspiciously at him.They thought--if Hunter had not spoken to
Newman, it must be because he was already working under price.There
had been a rumour going about the last few days to that effect.They're not goin' to pay more than six and a
half after this week.''That's not what 'e said to me.Said  I
didn't do enough for 'em.'exclaimed Crass, pretending to be overcome with
surprise.Newman's account of what had transpired was listened to in gloomy
silence.'Those who--a few minutes previously--had been talking loudly
of chucking up the job became filled with apprehension that they might
be served in the same manner as he had been.Crass was one of the
loudest in his expression of astonishment and indignation, but he
rather overdid it and only succeeded in confirming the secret suspicion
of the others that he had had something to do with Hunter's action.The result of the discussion was that they decided to submit to
Misery's terms for the time being, until they could see a chance of
getting work elsewhere.As Owen had to go to the office to see the wallpaper spoken of by
Hunter, he accompanied Newman when the latter went to get his wages.Nimrod was waiting for them, and had the money ready in an envelope,
which he handed to Newman, who took it without speaking and went away.Misery had been rummaging amongst the old wallpapers, and had got out a
great heap of odd rolls, which he now submitted to Owen, but after
examining them the latter said that they were unsuitable for the
purpose, so after some argument Misery was compelled to sign an order
for some proper cartridge paper, which Owen obtained at a stationer's
on his way home.The next morning, when Misery went to the 'Cave', he was in a fearful
rage, and he kicked up a terrible row with Crass.He said that Mr
Rushton had been complaining of the lack of discipline on the job, and
he told Crass to tell all the hands that for the future singing in
working hours was strictly forbidden, and anyone caught breaking this
rule would be instantly dismissed.Several times during the following days Nimrod called at Owen's flat to
see how the work was progressing and to impress upon him the necessity
of not taking too much trouble over it.John Starr


'What time is it now, Mum?'asked Frankie as soon as he had finished
dinner on the following Sunday.Only one more hour and Charley will be here!Oh, I wish it
was three o'clock now, don't you, Mother?''You're surely not going to make me wear my velvets, are you, Mum?Can't I go just as I am, in my old clothes?'The'velvets' was a brown suit of that material that Nora had made out
of the least worn parts of an old costume of her own.'Of course not: if you went as you are now, you'd have everyone staring
at you.''Well, I suppose I'll have to put up with it,' said Frankie, resignedly.'And I think you'd better begin to dress me now, don't you?''Oh, there's plenty of time yet; you'd only make yourself untidy and
then I should have the trouble all over again.Play with your toys a
little while, and when I've done the washing up I'll get you ready.'Frankie obeyed, and for about ten minutes his mother heard him in the
next room rummaging in the box where he stored his collection of
'things'.At the end of that time, however, he returned to the
kitchen.'Is it time to dress me yet, Mum?'You needn't be afraid; you'll be ready in plenty
of time.''But I can't help being afraid; you might forget.''Well, you know, I should be much easier in my mind if you would dress
me now, because perhaps our clock's wrong, or p'r'aps when you begin
dressing me you'll find some buttons off or something, and then
there'll be a lot of time wasted sewing them on; or p'r'aps you won't
be able to find my clean stockings or something and then while you're
looking for it Charley might come, and if he sees I'm not ready he
mightn't wait for me.'said Nora, pretending to be alarmed at this appalling list
of possibilities.'I suppose it will be safer to dress you at once.It's very evident you won't let me have much peace until it is done,
but mind when you're dressed you'll have to sit down quietly and wait
till he comes, because I don't want the trouble of dressing you twice.''Oh, I don't mind sitting still,' returned Frankie, loftily.'I don't mind having to take care of my clothes,' said Frankie as his
mother--having washed and dressed him, was putting the finishing
touches to his hair, brushing and combing and curling the long yellow
locks into ringlets round her fingers, 'the only thing I don't like is
having my hair done.I'm sure it would save you a lot of trouble if you wouldn't mind
cutting them off.'Nora did not answer: somehow or other she was unwilling to comply with
this often-repeated entreaty.It seemed to her that when this hair was
cut off the child would have become a different individual--more
separate and independent.'If you don't want to cut it off for your own sake, you might do it for
my sake, because I think it's the reason some of the big boys don't
want to play with me, and some of them shout after me and say I'm a
girl, and sometimes they sneak up behind me and pull it.Only
yesterday I had to have a fight with a boy for doing it: and even
Charley Linden laughs at me, and he's my best friend--except you and
Dad of course.'Why don't you cut it off, Mum?''I am going to cut it as I promised you, after your next birthday.''Then I shall be jolly glad when it comes.Why, what's the
matter, Mum?Frankie was so concerned that
he began to cry also, wondering if he had done or said something wrong.He kissed her repeatedly, stroking her face with his hand.'I was thinking that when you're over seven and you've had your hair
cut short you won't be a baby any more.''Why, I'm not a baby now, am I?He strode over to the wall and, dragging out two chairs, he placed them
in the middle of the room, back to back, about fifteen inches apart,
and before his mother realized what he was doing he had climbed up and
stood with one leg on the back of each chair.'I should like to see a baby who could do this,' he cried, with his
face wet with tears.Babies can't do tricks like these or even wipe up the spoons
and forks or sweep the passage.But you needn't cut it off if you
don't want to.I'll bear it as long as you like.Only don't cry any
more, because it makes me miserable.If I cry when I fall down or when
you pull my hair when you're combing it you always tell me to bear it
like a man and not be a baby, and now you're crying yourself just
because I'm not a baby.You ought to be jolly glad that I'm nearly
grown up into a man, because you know I've promised to build you a
house with the money I earn, and then you needn't do no more work.We'll have a servant the same as the people downstairs, and Dad can
stop at home and sit by the fire and read the paper or play with me and
Maud and have pillow fights and tell stories and--'

'It's all right, dearie,' said Nora, kissing him.'I'm not crying now,
and you mustn't either, or your eyes will be all red and you won't be
able to go with Charley at all.'When she had finished dressing him, Frankie sat for some time in
silence, apparently lost in thought.At last he said:

'Why don't you get a baby, Mother?You could nurse it, and I could
have it to play with instead of going out in the street.''We can't afford to keep a baby, dear.You know, even as it is,
sometimes we have to go without things we want because we haven't the
money to buy them.Babies need many things that cost lots of money.''When I build our house when I'm a man, I'll take jolly good care not
to have a gas-stove in it.That's what runs away with all the money;
we're always putting pennies in the slot.And that reminds me: Charley
said I'll have to take a ha'penny to put in the mishnery box.Oh, dear,
I'm tired of sitting still.Before she could answer both Frankie's anxiety and the painful ordeal
of sitting still were terminated by the loud peal at the bell
announcing Charley's arrival, and Frankie, without troubling to observe
the usual formality of looking out of the window to see if it was a
runaway ring, had clattered half-way downstairs before he heard his
mother calling him to come back for the halfpenny; then he clattered up
again and then down again at such a rate and with so much noise as to
rouse the indignation of all the respectable people in the house.When he arrived at the bottom of the stairs he remembered that he had
omitted to say goodbye, and as it was too far to go up again he rang
the bell and then went into the middle of the road and looked up at the
window that Nora opened.'Tell Dad I forgot to say it before I
came down.'The School was not conducted in the chapel itself, but in a large
lecture hall under it.At one end was a small platform raised about
six inches from the floor; on this was a chair and a small table.A
number of groups of chairs and benches were arranged at intervals round
the sides and in the centre of the room, each group of seats
accommodating a separate class.On the walls--which were painted a
pale green--were a number of  pictures: Moses striking the
Rock, the Israelites dancing round the Golden Calf, and so on.As the
reader is aware, Frankie had never been to a Sunday School of any kind
before, and he stood for a moment looking in at the door and half
afraid to enter.The lessons had already commenced, but the scholars
had not yet settled down to work.The scene was one of some disorder: some of the children talking,
laughing or playing, and the teachers alternately threatening and
coaxing them.The girls' and the very young children's classes were
presided over by ladies: the boys' teachers were men.The reader already has some slight knowledge of a few of these people.There was Mr Didlum, Mr Sweater, Mr Rushton and Mr Hunter and Mrs
Starvem (Ruth Easton's former mistress).On this occasion, in addition
to the teachers and other officials of the Sunday School, there were
also present a considerable number of prettily dressed ladies and a few
gentlemen, who had come in the hope of meeting the Rev.John Starr, the
young clergyman who was going to be their minister for the next few
weeks during the absence of their regular shepherd, Mr Belcher, who was
going away for a holiday for the benefit of his health.Mr Belcher was
not suffering from any particular malady, but was merely 'run down',
and rumour had it that this condition had been brought about by the
rigorous asceticism of his life and his intense devotion to the arduous
labours of his holy calling.Mr Starr had conducted the service in the Shining Light Chapel that
morning, and a great sensation had been produced by the young
minister's earnest and eloquent address, which was of a very different
style from that of their regular minister.Although perhaps they had
not quite grasped the real significance of all that he had said, most
of them had been favourably impressed by the young clergyman's
appearance and manner in the morning: but that might have arisen from
prepossession and force of habit, for they were accustomed, as a matter
of course, to think well of any minister.There were, however, one or
two members of the congregation who were not without some misgivings
and doubts as to the soundness of his doctrines.Mr Starr had promised
that he would look in some time during the afternoon to say a few words
to the Sunday School children, and consequently on this particular
afternoon all the grown-ups were looking forward so eagerly to hearing
him again that not much was done in the way of lessons.Every time a
late arrival entered all eyes were directed towards the door in the
hope and expectation that it was he.When Frankie, standing at the door, saw all the people looking at him
he drew back timidly.'Come on, man,' said Charley.'You needn't be afraid; it's not like a
weekday school; they can't do nothing to us, not even if we don't
behave ourselves.There's our class over in that corner and that's our
teacher, Mr Hunter.Thus encouraged, Frankie followed Charley over to the class, and both
sat down.The teacher was so kind and spoke so gently to the children
that in a few minutes Frankie felt quite at home.When Hunter noticed how well cared for and well dressed he was he
thought the child must belong to well-to-do, respectable parents.Frankie did not pay much attention to the lesson, for he was too much
interested in the pictures on the walls and in looking at the other
children.He also noticed a very fat man who was not teaching at all,
but drifted aimlessly about he room from one class to another.After a
time he came and stood by the class where Frankie was, and, after
nodding to Hunter, remained near, listening and smiling patronizingly
at the children.He was arrayed in a long garment of costly black
cloth, a sort of frock coat, and by the rotundity of his figure he
seemed to be one of those accustomed to sit in the chief places at
feasts.Mr Belcher, minister of the Shining Light
Chapel.His short, thick neck was surrounded by a studless collar, and
apparently buttonless, being fastened in some mysterious way known only
to himself, and he showed no shirt front.The long garment beforementioned was unbuttoned and through the opening
there protruded a vast expanse of waistcoat and trousers, distended
almost to bursting by the huge globe of flesh they contained.A gold
watch-chain with a locket extended partly across the visible portion of
the envelope of the globe.He had very large feet which were carefully
encased in soft calfskin boots.If he had removed the long garment,
this individual would have resembled a balloon: the feet representing
the car and the small head that surmounted the globe, the safety valve;
as it was it did actually serve the purpose of a safety valve, the
owner being, in consequence of gross overfeeding and lack of natural
exercise, afflicted with chronic flatulence, which manifested itself in
frequent belchings forth through the mouth of the foul gases generated
in the stomach by the decomposition of the foods with which it was
generally loaded.Mr Belcher had never been seen with
his coat off, no one ever noticed the resemblance.It was not
necessary for him to take his coat off: his part in life was not to
help to produce, but to help to devour the produce of the labour of
others.After exchanging a few words and grins with Hunter, he moved on to
another class, and presently Frankie with a feeling of awe noticed that
the confused murmuring sound that had hitherto pervaded the place was
hushed.The time allotted for lessons had expired, and the teachers
were quietly distributing hymn-books to the children.Meanwhile the
balloon had drifted up to the end of the hall and had ascended the
platform, where it remained stationary by the side of the table,
occasionally emitting puffs of gas through the safety valve.On the
table were several books, and also a pile of folded cards.These latter
were about six inches by three inches; there was some printing on the
outside: one of them was lying open on the table, showing the inside,
which was ruled and had money columns.Presently Mr Belcher reached out a flabby white hand and, taking up one
of the folded cards, he looked around upon the under-fed, ill-clad
children with a large, sweet, benevolent, fatherly smile, and then in a
drawling voice occasionally broken by explosions of flatulence, he said:

'My dear children.This afternoon as I was standing near Brother
Hunter's class I heard him telling them of the wanderings of the
Children of Israel in the wilderness, and of all the wonderful things
that were done for them; and I thought how sad it was that they were so
ungrateful.'Now those ungrateful Israelites had received many things, but we have
even more cause to be grateful than they had, for we have received even
more abundantly than they did.'(Here the good man's voice was stilled
by a succession of explosions.)'And I am sure,' he resumed, 'that
none of you would like to be even as those Israelites, ungrateful for
all the good things you have received.Oh, how thankful you should be
for having been made happy English children.Now, I am sure that you
are grateful and that you will all be very glad of an opportunity of
showing your gratitude by doing something in return.'Doubtless some of you have noticed the unseemly condition of the
interior of our Chapel.the walls are sadly in need of cleansing and distempering, and they
also need cementing externally to keep out the draught.The seats and
benches and the chairs are also in a most unseemly condition and need
varnishing.'Now, therefore, after much earnest meditation and prayer, it has been
decided to open a Subscription List, and although times are very hard
just now, we believe we shall succeed in getting enough to have the
work done; so I want each one of you to take one of these cards and go
round to all your friends to see how much you can collect.It doesn't
matter how trifling the amounts are, because the smallest donations
will be thankfully received.'Now, I hope you will all do your very best.Ask everyone you know; do
not refrain from asking people because you think that they are too poor
to give a donation, but remind them that if they cannot give their
thousands they can give the widow's mite.First of all
ask those whom you feel certain will give: then ask all those whom you
think may possibly give: and, finally, ask all those whom you feel
certain will not give: and you will be surprised to find that many of
these last will donate abundantly.'If your friends are very poor and unable to give a large donation at
one time, a good plan would be to arrange to call upon them every
Saturday afternoon with your card to collect their donations.And
while you are asking others, do not forget to give what you can
yourselves.Just a little self-denial, and those pennies and
half-pennies which you so often spend on sweets and other unnecessary
things might be given--as a donation--to the good cause.'Here the holy man paused again, and there was a rumbling, gurgling
noise in the interior of the balloon, followed by several escapes of
gas through the safety valve.The paroxysm over, the apostle of
self-denial continued:

'All those who wish to collect donations will stay behind for a few
minutes after school, when Brother Hunter--who has kindly consented to
act as secretary to the fund--will issue the cards.'I would like here to say a few words of thanks to Brother Hunter for
the great interest he has displayed in this matter, and for all the
trouble he is taking to help us to gather in the donations.'This tribute was well deserved; Hunter in fact had originated the whole
scheme in the hope of securing the job for Rushton & Co., and
two-and-a-half per cent of the profits for himself.Mr Belcher now replaced the collecting card on the table and, taking up
one of the hymn-books, gave out the words and afterwards conducted the
singing, flourishing one fat, flabby white hand in the air and holding
the book in the other.As the last strains of the music died away, he closed his eyes and a
sweet smile widened his mouth as he stretched forth his right hand,
open, palm down, with the fingers close together, and said:

'Let us pray.'With much shuffling of feet everyone knelt down.Hunter's lanky form
was distributed over a very large area; his body lay along one of the
benches, his legs and feet sprawled over the floor, and his huge hands
clasped the sides of the seat.His eyes were tightly closed and an
expression of the most intense misery pervaded his long face.Mrs Starvem, being so fat that she knew if she once knelt down she
would never be able to get up again, compromised by sitting on the
extreme edge of her chair, resting her elbows on the back of the seat
in front of her, and burying her face in her hands.It was a very
large face, but her hands were capacious enough to receive it.In a seat at the back of the hall knelt a pale-faced, weary-looking
little woman about thirty-six years of age, very shabbily dressed, who
had come in during the singing.This was Mrs White, the caretaker,
Bert White's mother.When her husband died, the committee of the
Chapel, out of charity, gave her this work, for which they paid her six
shillings a week.Of course, they could not offer her full employment;
the idea was that she could get other work as well, charing and things
of that kind, and do the Chapel work in between.There wasn't much to
do: just the heating furnace to light when necessary; the Chapel,
committee rooms, classrooms and Sunday School to sweep and scrub out
occasionally; the hymn-books to collect, etc.Whenever they had a tea
meeting--which was on an average about twice a week--there were the
trestle tables to fix up, the chairs to arrange, the table to set out,
and then, supervised by Miss Didlum or some other lady, the tea to
make.There was rather a lot to do on the days following these
functions: the washing up, the tables and chairs to put away, the floor
to sweep, and so on; but the extra work was supposed to be compensated
by the cakes and broken victuals generally left over from the feast,
which were much appreciated as a welcome change from the bread and
dripping or margarine that constituted Mrs White's and Bert's usual
fare.There were several advantages attached to the position: the caretaker
became acquainted with the leading members and their wives, some of
who, out of charity, occasionally gave her a day's work as charwoman,
the wages being on about the same generous scale as those she earned at
the Chapel, sometimes supplemented by a parcel of broken victuals or
some castoff clothing.An evil-minded, worldly or unconverted person might possibly sum up the
matter thus: these people required this work done: they employed this
woman to do it, taking advantage of her poverty to impose upon her
conditions of price and labour that they would not have liked to endure
themselves.Although she worked very hard, early and late, the money
they paid her as wages was insufficient to enable her to provide
herself with the bare necessaries of life.Then her employers, being
good, kind, generous, Christian people, came to the rescue and bestowed
charity, in the form of cast-off clothing and broken victuals.Should any such evil-minded, worldly or unconverted persons happen to
read these lines, it is a sufficient answer to their impious and
malicious criticisms to say that no such thoughts ever entered the
simple mind of Mrs White herself: on the contrary, this very afternoon
as she knelt in the Chapel, wearing an old mantle that some years
previously had adorned the obese person of the saintly Mrs Starvem, her
heart was filled with gratitude towards her generous benefactors.During the prayer the door was softly opened: a gentleman in clerical
dress entered on tiptoe and knelt down next to Mr Didlum.He came in
very softly, but all the same most of those present heard him and
lifted their heads or peeped through their fingers to see who it was,
and when they recognized him a sound like a sigh swept through the hall.At the end of the prayer, amid groans and cries of 'Amen', the balloon
slowly descended from the platform, and collapsed into one of the
seats, and everyone rose up from the floor.When all were seated and
the shuffling, coughing and blowing of noses had ceased Mr Didlum stood
up and said:

'Before we sing the closin' 'ymn, the gentleman hon my left, the Rev.Mr John Starr, will say a few words.'An expectant murmur rippled through the hall.The ladies lifted their
eyebrows and nodded, smiled and whispered to each other; the gentlemen
assumed various attitudes and expressions; the children were very
quiet.Everyone was in a state of suppressed excitement as John Starr
rose from his seat and, stepping up on to the platform, stood by the
side of the table, facing them.He was about twenty-six years of age, tall and slenderly built.His
clean-cut, intellectual face, with its lofty forehead, and his air of
refinement and culture were in striking contrast to the coarse
appearance of the other adults in the room: the vulgar, ignorant,
uncultivated crowd of profit-mongers and hucksters in front of him.But
it was not merely his air of good breeding and the general comeliness
of his exterior that attracted and held one.There was an indefinable
something about him--an atmosphere of gentleness and love that seemed
to radiate from his whole being, almost compelling confidence and
affection from all those with whom he came in contact.As he stood
there facing the others with an inexpressibly winning smile upon his
comely face, it seemed impossible that there could be any fellowship
between him and them.There was nothing in his appearance to give anyone even an inkling of
the truth, which was: that he was there for the purpose of bolstering
up the characters of the despicable crew of sweaters and slave-drivers
who paid his wages.He did not give a very long address this afternoon--only just a Few
Words; but they were very precious, original and illuminating.He told
them of certain Thoughts that had occurred to his mind on his way there
that afternoon; and as they listened, Sweater, Rushton, Didlum, Hunter,
and the other disciples exchanged significant looks and gestures.In fact, as they
afterwards modestly admitted to each other, it was so profound that
even they experienced great difficulty in fathoming the speaker's
meaning.As for the ladies, they were motionless and dumb with admiration.They
sat with flushed faces, shining eyes and palpitating hearts, looking
hungrily at the dear man as he proceeded:

'Unfortunately, our time this afternoon does not permit us to dwell at
length upon these Thoughts.Perhaps at some future date we may have
the blessed privilege of so doing; but this afternoon I have been asked
to say a Few Words on another subject.The failing health of your dear
minister has for some time past engaged the anxious attention of the
congregation.'Sympathetic glances were directed towards the interesting invalid; the
ladies murmured, 'Poor dear!''Although naturally robust,' continued Starr, 'long, continued
Overwork, the loving solicitude for Others that often prevented him
taking even necessary repose, and a too rigorous devotion to the
practice of Self-denial have at last brought about the inevitable
Breakdown, and rendered a period of Rest absolutely imperative.'The orator paused to take breath, and the silence that ensued was
disturbed only by faint rumblings in the interior of the ascetic victim
of overwork.'With this laudable object,' proceeded Starr, 'a Subscription List was
quietly opened about a month ago, and those dear children who had cards
and assisted in the good work of collecting donations will be pleased
to hear that altogether a goodly sum was gathered, but as it was not
quite enough, the committee voted a further amount out of the General
Fund, and at a special meeting held last Friday evening, your dear
Shepherd was presented with an illuminated address, and a purse of gold
sufficient to defray the expenses of a month's holiday in the South of
France.'Although, of course, he regrets being separated from you even for such
a brief period he feels that in going he is choosing the lesser of two
evils.It is better to go to the South of France for a month than to
continue Working in spite of the warnings of exhausted nature and
perhaps be taken away from you altogether--to Heaven.'fervently ejaculated several disciples, and a ghastly
pallor overspread the features of the object of their prayers.'Even as it is there is a certain amount of danger.Let us hope and
pray for the best, but if the worst should happen and he is called upon
to Ascend, there will be some satisfaction in knowing that you have
done what you could to avert the dreadful calamity.'Here, probably as a precaution against the possibility of an
involuntary ascent, a large quantity of gas was permitted to escape
through the safety valve of the balloon.'He sets out on his pilgrimage tomorrow,' concluded Starr, 'and I am
sure he will be followed by the good wishes and prayers of all the
members of his flock.'The reverend gentleman resumed his seat, and almost immediately it
became evident from the oscillations of the balloon that Mr Belcher was
desirous of rising to say a Few Words in acknowledgement, but he was
restrained by the entreaties of those near him, who besought him not to
exhaust himself.He afterwards said that he would not have been able
to say much even if they had permitted him to speak, because he felt
too full.'During the absence of our beloved pastor,' said Brother Didlum, who
now rose to give out the closing hymn, 'his flock will not be left
hentirely without a shepherd, for we 'ave arranged with Mr Starr to
come and say a Few Words to us hevery Sunday.'From the manner in which they constantly referred to themselves, it
might have been thought that they were a flock of sheep instead of
being what they really were--a pack of wolves.When they heard Brother Didlum's announcement a murmur of intense
rapture rose from the ladies, and Mr Starr rolled his eyes and smiled
sweetly.Brother Didlum did not mention the details of the
'arrangement', to have done so at that time would have been most
unseemly, but the following extract from the accounts of the chapel
will not be out of place here: 'Paid to Rev.14--L4.4.0 per the treasurer.'It was not a large sum considering
the great services rendered by Mr Starr, but, small as it was, it is to
be feared that many worldly, unconverted persons will think it was far
too much to pay for a Few Words, even such wise words as Mr John
Starr's admittedly always were.But the Labourer is worthy of his hire.After the'service' was over, most of the children, including Charley
and Frankie, remained to get collecting cards.Mr Starr was surrounded
by a crowd of admirers, and a little later, when he rode away with Mr
Belcher and Mr Sweater in the latter's motor car, the ladies looked
hungrily after that conveyance, listening to the melancholy 'pip, pip'
of its hooter and trying to console themselves with the reflection that
they would see him again in a few hours' time at the evening service.Chapter 18

The Lodger


In accordance with his arrangement with Hunter, Owen commenced the work
in the drawing-room on the Monday morning.Harlow and Easton were
distempering some of the ceilings, and about ten o'clock they went down
to the scullery to get some more whitewash.Crass was there as usual,
pretending to be very busy mixing colours.'Well, wot do you think of it?'he said as he served them with what
they required.'Why, hour speshul hartist,' replied Crass with a sneer.'Do you think
'e's goin' to get through with it?''Shouldn't like to say,' replied Easton guardedly.'You know it's one thing to draw on a bit of paper and colour it with a
penny box of paints, and quite another thing to do it on a wall or
ceiling,' continued Crass.'Yes; that's true enough,' said Harlow.'Do you believe they're 'is own designs?''Be rather 'ard to tell,' remarked Easton, embarrassed.Neither Harlow nor Easton shared Crass's sentiments in this matter, but
at the same time they could not afford to offend him by sticking up for
Owen.'If you was to ast me, quietly,' Crass added, 'I should be more
inclined to say as 'e copied it all out of some book.''That's just about the size of it, mate,' agreed Harlow.'It would be a bit of all right if 'e was to make a bloody mess of it,
wouldn't it?'Crass continued with a malignant leer.When the two men regained the upper landing on which they were working
they exchanged significant glances and laughed quietly.Hearing these
half-suppressed sounds of merriment, Philpot, who was working alone in
a room close by, put his head out of the doorway.'Ole Crass ain't arf wild about Owen doin' that room,' replied Harlow,
and repeated the substance of Crass's remarks.'It is a bit of a take-down for the bleeder, ain't it, 'avin' to play
second fiddle,' said Philpot with a delighted grin.''E's opin' Owen'll make a mess of it,' Easton whispered.'Well, 'e'll be disappointed, mate,' answered Philpot.'I was workin'
along of Owen for Pushem and Sloggem about two year ago, and I seen 'im
do a job down at the Royal 'Otel--the smokin'-room ceilin' it was--and
I can tell you it looked a bloody treat!''I've heard tell of it,' said Harlow.'There's no doubt Owen knows 'is work,' remarked Easton, 'although 'e
is a bit orf is onion about Socialism.''I don't know so much about that, mate,' returned Philpot.'I agree
with a lot that 'e ses.I've often thought the same things meself, but
I can't talk like 'im, 'cause I ain't got no 'ead for it.''I agree with some of it too,' said Harlow with a laugh, 'but all the
same 'e does say some bloody silly things, you must admit.For
instance, that stuff about money bein' the cause of poverty.'I can't exactly see that meself,' agreed Philpot.'We must tackle 'im about that at dinner-time,' said Harlow.'I should
rather like to 'ear 'ow 'e makes it out.''For Gord's sake don't go startin' no arguments at dinner-time,' said
Easton.'Leave 'im alone when 'e is quiet.''Yes; let's 'ave our dinner in peace, if possible,' said Philpot.he added, hoarsely, suddenly holding up his hand warningly.It was evident from the creaking of the stairs that
someone was crawling up them.Harlow
lifted up the pail of whitewash and set it down again noisily.'I think we'd better 'ave the steps and the plank over this side,
Easton,' he said in a loud voice.I think that'll be the best way,' replied Easton.While they were arranging their scaffold to do the ceiling Crass
arrived on the landing.He made no remark at first, but walked into
the room to see how many ceilings they had done.'You'd better look alive, you chaps, he said as he went downstairs
again.'If we don't get these ceilings finished by dinner-time,
Nimrod's sure to ramp.''All right,' said Harlow, gruffly.'We'll bloody soon slosh 'em over.''Slosh' was a very suitable word; very descriptive of the manner in
which the work was done.The cornices of the staircase ceilings were
enriched with plaster ornaments.These ceilings were supposed to have
been washed off, but as the men who were put to do that work had not
been allowed sufficient time to do it properly, the crevices of the
ornaments were still filled up with old whitewash, and by the time
Harlow and Easton had'sloshed' a lot more whitewash on to them they
were mere formless unsightly lumps of plaster.The 'hands' who did the
'washing off' were not to blame.They had been hunted away from the
work before it was half done.While Harlow and Easton were distempering these ceilings, Philpot and
the other hands were proceeding with the painting in different parts of
the inside of the house, and Owen, assisted by Bert, was getting on
with the work in the drawing-room, striking chalk lines and measuring
and setting out the different panels.There were no 'political' arguments that day at dinner-time, to the
disappointment of Crass, who was still waiting for an opportunity to
produce the Obscurer cutting.After dinner, when the others had all
gone back to their work, Philpot unobtrusively returned to the kitchen
and gathered up the discarded paper wrappers in which some of the men
had brought their food.Spreading one of these open, he shook the
crumbs from the others upon it.In this way and by picking up
particles of bread from the floor, he collected a little pile of crumbs
and crusts.To these he added some fragments that he had left from his
own dinner.He then took the parcel upstairs and opening one of the
windows threw the crumbs on to the roof of the portico.He had
scarcely closed the window when two starlings fluttered down and began
to eat.Philpot watching them furtively from behind the shutter.From one till five seemed a very long
time to most of the hands, but to Owen and his mate, who were doing
something in which they were able to feel some interest and pleasure,
the time passed so rapidly that they both regretted the approach of
evening.'Other days,' remarked Bert, 'I always keeps on wishin' it was time to
go 'ome, but today seems to 'ave gorn like lightnin'!'After leaving off that night, all the men kept together till they
arrived down town, and then separated.Owen went by himself: Easton,
Philpot, Crass and Bundy adjourned to the 'Cricketers Arms' to have a
drink together before going home, and Slyme, who was a teetotaler, went
by himself, although he was now lodging with Easton.'Don't wait for me,' said the latter as he went off with Crass and the
others.'I shall most likely catch you up before you get there.'This evening Slyme did not take the direct road home.He turned into
the main street, and, pausing before the window of a toy shop, examined
the articles displayed therein attentively.After some minutes he
appeared to have come to a decision, and entering the shop he purchased
a baby's rattle for fourpence halfpenny.It was a pretty toy made of
white bone and  wool, with a number of little bells hanging
upon it, and a ring of white bone at the end of the handle.When he came out of the shop Slyme set out for home, this time walking
rapidly.When he entered the house Ruth was sitting by the fire with
the baby on her lap.She looked up with an expression of
disappointment as she perceived that he was alone.'He's gone to 'ave a drink with some of the chaps.He said he wouldn't
be long,' replied Slyme as he put his food basket on the dresser and
went upstairs to his room to wash and to change his clothes.When he came down again, Easton had not yet arrived.'Everything's ready, except just to make the tea,' said Ruth, who was
evidently annoyed at the continued absence of Easton,'so you may as
well have yours now.'I'll wait a little and see if he comes.'If you're sure you don't mind, I shall be glad if you will wait,' said
Ruth, 'because it will save me making two lots of tea.'They waited for about half an hour, talking at intervals in a
constrained, awkward way about trivial subjects.Then as Easton did
not come, Ruth decided to serve Slyme without waiting any longer.With
this intention she laid the baby in its cot, but the child resented
this arrangement and began to cry, so she had to hold him under her
left arm while she made the tea.Seeing her in this predicament, Slyme
exclaimed, holding out his hands:

'Here, let me hold him while you do that.'said Ruth, who, in spite of her instinctive dislike of the
man, could not help feeling gratified with this attention.'Well, mind
you don't let him fall.'But the instant Slyme took hold of the child it began to cry even
louder than it did when it was put into the cradle.'He's always like that with strangers,' apologized Ruth as she took him
back again.'Wait a minute,' said Slyme, 'I've got something upstairs in my pocket
that will keep him quiet.He went up to his room and presently returned with the rattle.When
the baby saw the bright colours and heard the tinkling of the bells he
crowed with delight, and reached out his hands eagerly towards it and
allowed Slyme to take him without a murmur of protest.Before Ruth had
finished making and serving the tea the man and child were on the very
best of terms with each other, so much so indeed that when Ruth had
finished and went to take him again, the baby seemed reluctant to part
from Slyme, who had been dancing him in the air and tickling him in the
most delightful way.Ruth, too, began to have a better opinion of Slyme, and felt inclined
to reproach herself for having taken such an unreasonable dislike of
him at first.He was evidently a very good sort of fellow after all.The baby had by this time discovered the use of the bone ring at the
end of the handle of the toy and was biting it energetically.'It's a very beautiful rattle,' said Ruth.'I heard you say the other day that he wanted something of the kind to
bite on to help his teeth through,' answered Slyme, 'and when I
happened to notice that in the shop I remembered what you said and
thought I'd bring it home.'The baby took the ring out of its mouth and shaking the rattle
frantically in the air laughed and crowed merrily, looking at Slyme.'That's not your Dad, you silly boy,' she said, kissing the child as
she spoke.'Your dad ought to be ashamed of himself for staying out
like this.We'll give him dad, dad, dad, when he does come home, won't
we?'But the baby only shook the rattle and rang the bells and laughed and
crowed and laughed again, louder than ever.Chapter 19

The Filling of the Tank


Viewed from outside, the 'Cricketers Arms' was a pretentious-looking
building with plate-glass windows and a profusion of gilding.The
pilasters were painted in imitation of different marbles and the doors
grained to represent costly woods.There were panels containing
painted advertisements of wines and spirits and beer, written in gold,
and ornamented with gaudy colours.On the lintel over the principal
entrance was inscribed in small white letters:

'A.Licensed to sell wines, spirits and malt liquor by retail
to be consumed either on or off the premises.'The bar was arranged in the usual way, being divided into several
compartments.First there was the 'Saloon Bar': on the glass of the
door leading into this was fixed a printed bill: 'No four ale served in
this bar.'Next to the saloon bar was the jug and bottle department,
much appreciated by ladies who wished to indulge in a drop of gin on
the quiet.There were also two small 'private' bars, only capable of
holding two or three persons, where nothing less than fourpennyworth of
spirits or glasses of ale at threepence were served.Finally, the
public bar, the largest compartment of all.At each end, separating it
from the other departments, was a wooden partition, painted and
varnished.Wooden forms fixed across the partitions and against the walls under
the windows provided seating accommodation for the customers.A large
automatic musical instrument--a 'penny in the slot'
polyphone--resembling a grandfather's clock in shape--stood against one
of the partitions and close up to the counter, so that those behind the
bar could reach to wind it up.Hanging on the partition near the
polyphone was a board about fifteen inches square, over the surface of
which were distributed a number of small hooks, numbered.At the
bottom of the board was a net made of fine twine, extended by means of
a semi-circular piece of wire.In this net several india-rubber rings
about three inches in diameter were lying.There was no table in the
place but jutting out from the other partition was a hinged flap about
three feet long by twenty inches wide, which could be folded down when
not in use.This was the shove-ha'penny board.The coins--old French
pennies--used in playing this game were kept behind the bar and might
be borrowed on application.On the partition, just above the
shove-ha'penny board was a neatly printed notice, framed and glazed:

                                 NOTICE

              Gentlemen using this house are requested to
                 refrain from using obscene language.Alongside this notice were a number of gaudily- bills
advertising the local theatre and the music-hall, and another of a
travelling circus and menagerie, then visiting the town and encamped on
a piece of waste ground about half-way on the road to Windley.The
fittings behind the bar, and the counter, were of polished mahogany,
with silvered plate glass at the back of the shelves.On the shelves
were rows of bottles and cut-glass decanters, gin, whisky, brandy and
wines and liqueurs of different kinds.When Crass, Philpot, Easton and Bundy entered, the landlord, a
well-fed, prosperous-looking individual in white shirt-sleeves, and a
bright maroon fancy waistcoat with a massive gold watch-chain and a
diamond ring, was conversing in an affable, friendly way with one of
his regular customers, who was sitting on the end of the seat close to
the counter, a shabbily dressed, bleary-eyed, degraded, beer-sodden,
trembling wretch, who spent the greater part of every day, and all his
money, in this bar.He was a miserable-looking wreck of a man about
thirty years of age, supposed to be a carpenter, although he never
worked at that trade now.It was commonly said that some years
previously he had married a woman considerably his senior, the landlady
of a third-rate lodging-house.This business was evidently
sufficiently prosperous to enable him to exist without working and to
maintain himself in a condition of perpetual semi-intoxication.This
besotted wretch practically lived at the 'Cricketers'.He came
regularly very morning and sometimes earned a pint of beer by assisting
the barman to sweep up the sawdust or clean the windows.He usually
remained in the bar until closing time every night.He was a very good
customer; not only did he spend whatever money he could get hold of
himself, but he was the cause of others spending money, for he was
acquainted with most of the other regular customers, who, knowing his
impecunious condition, often stood him a drink 'for the good of the
house'.The only other occupant of the public bar--previous to the entrance of
Crass and his mates--was a semi-drunken man, who appeared to be a
house-painter, sitting on the form near the shove-ha'penny board.He
was wearing a battered bowler hat and the usual shabby clothes.This
individual had a very thin, pale face, with a large, high-bridged nose,
and bore a striking resemblance to the portraits of the first Duke of
Wellington.He was not a regular customer here, having dropped in
casually about two o'clock and had remained ever since.He was
beginning to show the effects of the drink he had taken during that
time.As Crass and the others came in they were hailed with enthusiasm by the
landlord and the Besotted Wretch, while the semi-drunk workman regarded
them with fishy eyes and stupid curiosity.said the landlord, affably, addressing Crass, and
nodding familiarly to the others.'A.1,' replied the 'Old Dear', getting up from his chair in readiness
to execute their orders.'Well, wot's it to be?''Mine's a pint o' beer,' said Crass.'Half o' beer for me too,' replied Easton.'That's one pint, two 'arves, and a pint o' porter for meself,' said
Philpot, turning and addressing the Old Dear.While the landlord was serving these drinks the Besotted Wretch
finished his beer and set the empty glass down on the counter, and
Philpot observing this, said to him:

''Ave one along o' me?''I don't mind if I do,' replied the other.When the drinks were served, Philpot, instead of paying for them,
winked significantly at the landlord, who nodded silently and
unobtrusively made an entry in an account book that was lying on one of
the shelves.Although it was only Monday and he had been at work all
the previous week, Philpot was already stony broke.This was accounted
for by the fact that on Saturday he had paid his landlady something on
account of the arrears of board and lodging money that had accumulated
while he was out of work; and he had also paid the Old Dear four
shillings for drinks obtained on tick during the last week.'Well, 'ere's the skin orf yer nose,' said Crass, nodding to Philpot,
and taking a long pull at the pint glass which the latter had handed to
him.Similar appropriate and friendly sentiments were expressed by the
others and suitably acknowledged by Philpot, the founder of the feast.The Old Dear now put a penny in the slot of the polyphone, and winding
it up started it playing.It was some unfamiliar tune, but when the
Semi-drunk Painter heard it he rose unsteadily to his feet and began
shuffling and dancing about, singing:

                'Oh, we'll inwite you to the wedding,
                   An' we'll 'ave a glorious time!Where the boys an' girls is a-dancing,
                  An' we'll all get drunk on wine.''We
don't want that row 'ere.'The Semi-drunk stopped, and looking stupidly at the Old Dear, sank
abashed on to the seat again.'Well, we may as well sit as stand--for a few minutes,' remarked Crass,
suiting the action to the word.At frequent intervals the bar was entered by fresh customers, most of
them working men on their way home, who ordered and drank their pint or
half-pint of ale or porter and left at once.Bundy began reading the
advertisement of the circus and menageries and a conversation ensued
concerning the wonderful performances of the trained animals.The Old
Dear said that some of them had as much sense as human beings, and the
manner with which he made this statement implied that he thought it was
a testimonial to the sagacity of the brutes.He further said that he
had heard--a little earlier in the evening--a rumour that one of the
wild animals, a bear or something, had broken loose and was at present
at large.This was what he had heard--he didn't know if it were true
or not.For his own part he didn't believe it, and his hearers agreed
that it was highly improbable.Nobody ever knew how these silly yarns
got about.Presently the Besotted Wretch got up and, taking the india-rubber rings
out of the net with a trembling hand, began throwing them one at a time
at the hooks on the board.The rest of the company watched him with
much interest, laughing when he made a very bad shot and applauding
when he scored.''E's a bit orf tonight,' remarked Philpot aside to Easton, 'but as a
rule 'e's a fair knockout at it.The Semidrunk regarded the proceedings of the Besotted Wretch with an
expression of profound contempt.'You can't play for nuts,' he said scornfully.For a moment the Besotted Wretch hesitated.He had not money enough to
pay for drinks round.However, feeling confident of winning, he
replied:

'Come on then.Fifty or a 'undred or a bloody million!''All right,' agreed the Semi-drunk, anxious to distinguish himself.Holding the six rings in his left hand, the man stood in the middle of
the floor at a distance of about three yards from the board, with his
right foot advanced.Taking one of the rings between the forefinger
and thumb of his right hand, and closing his left eye, he carefully
'sighted' the centre hook, No.13; then he slowly extended his arm to
its full length in the direction of the board: then bending his elbow,
he brought his hand back again until it nearly touched his chin, and
slowly extended his arm again.He repeated these movements several
times, whilst the others watched with bated breath.Getting it right
at last he suddenly shot the ring at the board, but it did not go on
No.13; it went over the partition into the private bar.This feat was greeted with a roar of laughter.The player stared at
the board in a dazed way, wondering what had become of the ring.When
someone in the next bar threw it over the partition again, he realized
what had happened and, turning to the company with a sickly smile,
remarked:

'I ain't got properly used to this board yet: that's the reason of it.'He now began throwing the other rings at the board rather wildly,
without troubling to take aim.One struck the partition to the right
of the board: one to the left: one underneath: one went over the
counter, one on the floor, the other--the last--hit the board, and amid
a shout of applause, caught on the centre hook No.13, the highest
number it was possible to score with a single throw.'I shall be all right now that I've got the range,' observed the
Semi-drunk as he made way for his opponent.'You'll see something now,' whispered Philpot to Easton.'This bloke is
a dandy!'The Besotted Wretch took up his position and with an affectation of
carelessness began throwing the rings.It was really a remarkable
exhibition, for notwithstanding the fact that his hand trembled like
the proverbial aspen leaf, he succeeded in striking the board almost in
the centre every time; but somehow or other most of them failed to
catch on the hooks and fell into the net.When he finished his
innings, he had only scored 4, two of the rings having caught on the
No.''Ard lines,' remarked Bundy as he finished his beer and put the glass
down on the counter.'Drink up and 'ave another,' said Easton as he drained his own glass.'I don't mind if I do,' replied Crass, pouring what remained of the
pint down his throat.Philpot's glass had been empty for some time.'Same again,' said Easton, addressing the Old Dear and putting six
pennies on the counter.By this time the Semi-drunk had again opened fire on the board, but he
seemed to have lost the range, for none of the rings scored.They flew all over the place, and he finished his innings without
increasing his total.The Besotted Wretch now sailed in and speedily piled up 37.Then the
Semi-drunk had another go, and succeeded in getting 8.His case
appeared hopeless, but his opponent in his next innings seemed to go
all to pieces.Twice he missed the board altogether, and when he did
hit it he failed to score, until the very last throw, when he made 1.Then the Semi-drunk went in again and got 10.The scores were now:

        Besotted Wretch........................ 42
        Semi-drunk............................. 31

So far it was impossible to foresee the end.Crass became so excited that he absentmindedly opened his mouth and
shot his second pint down into his stomach with a single gulp, and
Bundy also drained his glass and called upon Philpot and Easton to
drink up and have another, which they accordingly did.While the Semi-drunk was having his next innings, the Besotted Wretch
placed a penny on the counter and called for a half a pint, which he
drank in the hope of steadying his nerves for a great effort.His
opponent meanwhile threw the rings at the board and missed it every
time, but all the same he scored, for one ring, after striking the
partition about a foot above the board, fell down and caught on the
hook.The other man now began his innings, playing very carefully, and nearly
every ring scored.As he played, the others uttered exclamations of
admiration and called out the result of every throw.The Semi-drunk accepted his defeat with a good grace, and after
explaining that he was a bit out of practice, placed a shilling on the
counter and invited the company to give their orders.Everyone asked
for 'the same again,' but the landlord served Easton, Bundy and the
Besotted Wretch with pints instead of half-pints as before, so there
was no change out of the shilling.'You know, there's a great deal in not bein' used to the board,' said
the Semi-drunk.'There's no disgrace in bein' beat by a man like 'im, mate,' said
Philpot.'Yes, there's no mistake about it.The Semi-drunk, though beaten, was not
disgraced: and he was so affected by the good feeling manifested by the
company that he presently produced a sixpence and insisted on paying
for another half-pint all round.Crass had gone outside during this conversation, but he returned in a
few minutes.'I feel a bit easier now,' he remarked with a laugh as he
took the half-pint glass that the Semi-drunk passed to him with a
shaking hand.One after the other, within a few minutes, the rest
followed Crass's example, going outside and returning almost
immediately: and as Bundy, who was the last to return, came back he
exclaimed:

'Let's 'ave a game of shove-'a'penny.''All right,' said Easton, who was beginning to feel reckless.'But
drink up first, and let's 'ave another.'He had only sevenpence left, just enough to pay for another pint for
Crass and half a pint for everyone else.The shove-ha'penny table was a planed mahogany board with a number of
parallel lines scored across it.The game is played by placing the
coin at the end of the board--the rim slightly overhanging the
edge--and striking it with the back part of the palm of the hand,
regulating the force of the blow according to the distance it is
desired to drive the coin.inquired Philpot of the landlord whilst
Easton and Bundy were playing.''E's doing a bit of a job down in the cellar; some of the valves gone
a bit wrong.But the missus is comin' down to lend me a hand
presently.The landlady--who at this moment entered through the door at the back
of the bar--was a large woman with a highly- countenance and a
tremendous bust, incased in a black dress with a shot silk blouse.She
had several jewelled gold rings on the fingers of each fat white hand,
and a long gold watch guard hung round her fat neck.She greeted Crass
and Philpot with condescension, smiling affably upon them.Meantime the game of shove-ha'penny proceeded merrily, the Semi-drunk
taking a great interest in it and tendering advice to both players
impartially.Bundy was badly beaten, and then Easton suggested that it
was time to think of going home.This proposal--slightly modified--met
with general approval, the modification being suggested by Philpot, who
insisted on standing one final round of drinks before they went.While they were pouring this down their throats, Crass took a penny
from his waistcoat pocket and put it in the slot of the polyphone.The
landlord put a fresh disc into it and wound it up and it began to play
'The Boys of the Bulldog Breed.'The Semi-drunk happened to know the
words of the chorus of this song, and when he heard the music he
started unsteadily to his feet and with many fierce looks and gestures
began to roar at the top of his voice:

        'They may build their ships, my lads,
        And try to play the game,
        But they can't build the boys of the Bulldog breed,
        Wot made ole Hingland's--'

''Ere!'I told you
once before that I don't allow that sort of thing in my 'ouse!''I don't mean no 'arm,' he said unsteadily, appealing to the company.'I don't want no chin from you!'said the Old Dear with a ferocious
scowl.'If you want to make that row you can go somewheres else, and
the sooner you goes the better.The man had been there long enough to spend every penny
he had been possessed of when he first came: he had no money left now,
a fact that the observant and experienced landlord had divined some
time ago.He therefore wished to get rid of the fellow before the
drink affected him further and made him helplessly drunk.The
Semi-drunk listened with indignation and wrath to the landlord's
insulting words.'I shall go when the bloody 'ell I like!''I shan't ask
you nor nobody else!It's orf the likes of me that you gets your bloody livin'!I
shall stop 'ere as long as I bloody well like, and if you don't like it
you can go to 'ell!'And, opening the door at the back of the bar, he roared out:

'Alf!''Yes, sir,' replied a voice, evidently from the basement.'All right,' replied the voice, and footsteps were heard ascending some
stairs.'You'll see some fun in a minute,' gleefully remarked Crass to Easton.The polyphone continued to play 'The Boys of the Bulldog Breed.'Philpot crossed over to the Semi-drunk.'Look 'ere, old man,' he
whispered, 'take my tip and go 'ome quietly.You'll only git the worse
of it, you know.''Not me, mate,' replied the other, shaking his head doggedly.''Ere I
am, and 'ere I'm goin' to bloody well stop.''No, you ain't,' replied Philpot coaxingly.I'll tell you
wot we'll do.You 'ave just one more 'arf-pint along of me, and then
we'll both go 'ome together.'Do
you think I'm drunk or wot?''You're all right, as
right as I am myself.You
don't want to stop 'ere all night, do you?'By this time Alf had arrived at the door of the back of the bar.He
was a burly young man about twenty-two or twenty-three years of age.'Put it outside,' growled the landlord, indicating the culprit.The barman instantly vaulted over the counter, and, having opened wide
the door leading into the street, he turned to the half-drunken man
and, jerking his thumb in the direction of the door, said:

'Are yer goin'?''I'm goin' to 'ave 'arf a pint along of this genelman first--'

'Yes.It's all right,' said Philpot to the landlord.'Let's 'ave two
'arf-pints, and say no more about it.''You mind your own business,' shouted the landlord, turning savagely on
him.I don't want no drunken men in my
'ouse.exclaimed the barman to the cause of the trouble, 'Outside!''Not before I've 'ad my 'arf--'

But before he could conclude, the barman had clutched him by the
collar, dragged him violently to the door and shot him into the middle
of the road, where he fell in a heap almost under the wheels of a
brewer's dray that happened to be passing.This accomplished, Alf shut
the door and retired behind the counter again.'Serve 'im bloody well right,' said Crass.'I couldn't 'elp laughin' when I seen 'im go flyin' through the bloody
door,' said Bundy.'You oughter 'ave more sense than to go interferin' like that,' said
Crass to Philpot.He was standing with his back to the others,
peeping out into the street over the top of the window casing.Then he
opened the door and went out into the street.Crass and the
others--through the window--watched him assist the Semi-drunk to his
feet and rub some of the dirt off his clothes, and presently after some
argument they saw the two go away together arm in arm.Crass and the others laughed, and returned to their half-finished
drinks.'Why, old Joe ain't drunk 'ardly 'arf of 'is!'cried Easton, seeing
Philpot's porter on the counter.'More fool 'im,' growled Crass.'There was no need for it: the man's
all right.'The Besotted Wretch gulped his beer down as quickly as he could, with
his eyes fixed greedily on Philpot's glass.He had just finished his
own and was about to suggest that it was a pity to waste the porter
when Philpot unexpectedly reappeared.'I think 'e'll be all right,' replied Philpot.'He wouldn't let me go
no further with 'im: said if I didn't go away, 'e'd go for me!But I
believe 'e'll be all right.I think the fall sobered 'im a bit.''Oh, 'e's all right,' said Crass offhandedly.'There's nothing the
matter with 'im.'Philpot now drank his porter, and bidding 'good night' to the Old Dear,
the landlady and the Besotted Wretch, they all set out for home.As
they went along the dark and lonely thoroughfare that led over the hill
to Windley, they heard from time to time the weird roaring of the wild
animals in the menagerie that was encamped in the adjacent field.Just
as they reached a very gloomy and deserted part, they suddenly observed
a dark object in the middle of the road some distance in front of them.It seemed to be a large animal of some kind and was coming slowly and
stealthily towards them.They stopped, peering in a half-frightened way through the darkness.Bundy stooped down to the ground,
groping about in search of a stone, and--with the exception of Crass,
who was too frightened to move--the others followed his example.They
found several large stones and stood waiting for the creature--whatever
it was--to come a little nearer so as to get a fair shot at it.They
were about to let fly when the creature fell over on its side and
moaned as if in pain.Observing this, the four men advanced cautiously
towards it.Bundy struck a match and held it over the prostrate
figure.After parting from Philpot, the poor wretch had managed to walk all
right for some distance.As Philpot had remarked, the fall had to some
extent sobered him; but he had not gone very far before the drink he
had taken began to affect him again and he had fallen down.Finding it
impossible to get up, he began crawling along on his hands and knees,
unconscious of the fact that he was travelling in the wrong direction.Even this mode of progression failed him at last, and he would probably
have been run over if they had not found him.They raised him up, and
Philpot, exhorting him to 'pull himself together' inquired where he
lived.The man had sense enough left to be able to tell them his
address, which was fortunately at Windley, where they all resided.Bundy and Philpot took him home, separating from Crass and Easton at
the corner of the street where both the latter lived.Crass felt very full and satisfied with himself.He had had six and a
half pints of beer, and had listened to two selections on the polyphone
at a total cost of one penny.Easton had but a few yards to go before reaching his own house after
parting from Crass, but he paused directly he heard the latter's door
close, and leaning against a street lamp yielded to the feeling of
giddiness and nausea that he had been fighting against all the way
home.All the inanimate objects around him seemed to be in motion.The
lights of the distant street lamps appeared to be floating about the
pavement and the roadway rose and fell like the surface of a troubled
sea.He searched his pockets for his handkerchief and having found it
wiped his mouth, inwardly congratulating himself that Crass was not
there to see him.Resuming his walk, after a few minutes he reached
his own home.As he passed through, the gate closed of itself after
him, clanging loudly.He went rather unsteadily up the narrow path
that led to his front door and entered.Slyme had gone up to his own room,
and Ruth was sitting sewing by the fireside.The table was still set
for two persons, for she had not yet taken her tea.he cried, throwing his
dinner basket carelessly on the floor with an affectation of joviality
and resting his hands on the table to support himself.'I've come at
last, you see.'Ruth left off sewing, and, letting her hands fall into her lap, sat
looking at him.His face was
ghastly pale, the eyes bloodshot and red-rimmed, the lips tremulous and
moist, and the ends of the hair of his fair moustache, stuck together
with saliva and stained with beer, hung untidily round his mouth in
damp clusters.Perceiving that she did not speak or smile, Easton concluded that she
was angry and became grave himself.'I've come at last, you see, my dear; better late than never.'He found it very difficult to speak plainly, for his lips trembled and
refused to form the words.'I don't know so much about that,' said Ruth, inclined to cry and
trying not to let him see the pity she could not help feeling for him.Easton shook his head and laughed foolishly.He walked clumsily towards her, still leaning on the table to steady
himself.'Don't be angry,' he mumbled as he stooped over her, putting his arm
round her neck and his face close to hers.'It's no good being angry,
you know, dear.'She shrank away, shuddering with involuntary disgust as he pressed his
wet lips and filthy moustache upon her mouth.His fetid breath, foul
with the smell of tobacco and beer, and the odour of the stale tobacco
smoke that exuded from his clothes filled her with loathing.He kissed
her repeatedly and when at last he released her she hastily wiped her
face with her handkerchief and shivered.Easton said he did not want any tea, and went upstairs to bed almost
immediately.Ruth did not want any tea either now, although she had
been very hungry before he came home.She sat up very late, sewing,
and when at length she did go upstairs she found him lying on his back,
partly undressed on the outside of the bedclothes, with his mouth wide
open, breathing stertorously.The Battle: Brigands versus Bandits


This is an even more unusually dull and uninteresting chapter, and
introduces several matters that may appear to have nothing to do with
the case.The reader is nevertheless entreated to peruse it, because
it contains certain information necessary to an understanding of this
history.The town of Mugsborough was governed by a set of individuals called the
Municipal Council.Most of these'representatives of the people' were
well-to-do or retired tradesmen.In the opinion of the inhabitants of
Mugsborough, the fact that a man had succeeded in accumulating money in
business was a clear demonstration of his fitness to be entrusted with
the business of the town.Consequently, when that very able and successful man of business Mr
George Rushton was put up for election to the Council he was returned
by a large majority of the votes of the working men who thought him an
ideal personage...

These Brigands did just as they pleased.They never consulted the ratepayers in any way.Even at
election time they did not trouble to hold meetings: each one of them
just issued a kind of manifesto setting forth his many noble qualities
and calling upon the people for their votes: and the latter never
failed to respond.They elected the same old crew time after time...

The Brigands committed their depredations almost unhindered, for the
voters were engaged in the Battle of Life.Like so many swine around a trough--they were so busily
engaged in this battle that most of them had no time to go to the park,
or they might have noticed that there were not so many costly plants
there as there should have been.And if they had inquired further they
would have discovered that nearly all the members of the Town Council
had very fine gardens.There was reason for these gardens being so
grand, for the public park was systematically robbed of its best to
make them so.There was a lake in the park where large numbers of ducks and geese
were kept at the ratepayers' expense.In addition to the food provided
for these fowl with public money, visitors to the park used to bring
them bags of biscuits and bread crusts.When the ducks and geese were
nicely fattened the Brigands used to carry them off and devour them at
home.When they became tired of eating duck or goose, some of the
Councillors made arrangements with certain butchers and traded away the
birds for meat.One of the most energetic members of the Band was Mr Jeremiah Didlum,
the house-furnisher, who did a large hire system trade.He had an
extensive stock of second-hand furniture that he had resumed possession
of when the unfortunate would-be purchasers failed to pay the
instalments regularly.Other of the second-hand things had been
purchased for a fraction of their real value at Sheriff's sales or from
people whom misfortune or want of employment had reduced to the
necessity of selling their household possessions.Another notable member of the Band was Mr Amos Grinder, who had
practically monopolized the greengrocery trade and now owned nearly all
the fruiterers' shops in the town.As for the other shops, if they did
not buy their stocks from him--or, rather, the company of which he was
managing director and principal shareholder--if these other fruiterers
and greengrocers did not buy their stuff from his company, he tried to
smash them by opening branches in their immediate neighbourhood and
selling below cost.He was a self-made man: an example of what may be
accomplished by cunning and selfishness.Then there was the Chief of the Band--Mr Adam Sweater, the Mayor.He
was always the Chief, although he was not always Mayor, it being the
rule that the latter 'honour' should be enjoyed by all the members of
the Band in turn.A bright 'honour', forsooth!to be the first citizen
in a community composed for the most part of ignorant semi-imbeciles,
slaves, slave-drivers and psalm-singing hypocrites.Mr Sweater was the
managing director and principal shareholder of a large drapery business
in which he had amassed a considerable fortune.This was not very
surprising, considering that he paid none of his workpeople fair wages
and many of them no wages at all.He employed a great number of girls
and young women who were supposed to be learning dressmaking,
mantle-making or millinery.These were all indentured apprentices,
some of whom had paid premiums of from five to ten pounds.They were
'bound' for three years.For the first two years they received no
wages: the third year they got a shilling or eightpence a week.At the
end of the third year they usually got the sack, unless they were
willing to stay on as improvers at from three shillings to four and
sixpence per week.They worked from half past eight in the morning till eight at night,
with an interval of an hour for dinner, and at half past four they
ceased work for fifteen minutes for tea.This was provided by the
firm--half a pint for each girl, but they had to bring their own milk
and sugar and bread and butter.Few of the girls ever learned their trades thoroughly.Some were
taught to make sleeves; others cuffs or button-holes, and so on.The
result was that in a short time each one became very expert and quick
at one thing; and although their proficiency in this one thing would
never enable them to earn a decent living, it enabled Mr Sweater to
make money during the period of their apprenticeship, and that was all
he cared about.Occasionally a girl of intelligence and spirit would insist on the
fulfilment of the terms of her indentures, and sometimes the parents
would protest.If this were persisted in those girls got on better:
but even these were turned to good account by the wily Sweater, who
induced the best of them to remain after their time was up by paying
them what appeared--by contrast with the others girls' money--good
wages, sometimes even seven or eight shillings a week!These girls then became a sort of
reserve who could be called up to crush any manifestation of discontent
on the part of the leading hands.The greater number of the girls, however, submitted tamely to the
conditions imposed upon them.They were too young to realize the wrong
that was being done them.As for their parents, it never occurred to
them to doubt the sincerity of so good a man as Mr Sweater, who was
always prominent in every good and charitable work.At the expiration of the girl's apprenticeship, if the parents
complained of her want of proficiency, the pious Sweater would
attribute it to idleness or incapacity, and as the people were
generally poor he seldom or never had any trouble with them.This was
how he fulfilled the unctuous promise made to the confiding parents at
the time the girl was handed over to his tender mercy--that he would
'make a woman of her'.This method of obtaining labour by false pretences and without payment,
which enabled him to produce costly articles for a mere fraction of the
price for which they were eventually sold, was adopted in other
departments of his business.He procured shop assistants of both sexes
on the same terms.A youth was indentured, usually for five years, to
be 'Made a Man of and 'Turned out fit to take a Position in any House'.If possible, a premium, five, ten, or twenty pounds--according to their
circumstances--would be extracted from the parents.For the first
three years, no wages: after that, perhaps two or three shillings a
week.At the end of the five years the work of 'Making a Man of him' would be
completed.Mr Sweater would then congratulate him and assure him that
he was qualified to assume a 'position' in any House but regret that
there was no longer any room for him in his.Still, if the Man wished he might stay on until he secured a better
'position' and, as a matter of generosity, although he did not really
need the Man's services, he would pay him ten shillings per week!Provided he was not addicted to drinking, smoking, gambling or the
Stock Exchange, or going to theatres, the young man's future was thus
assured.Even if he were unsuccessful in his efforts to obtain another
position he could save a portion of his salary and eventually commence
business on his own account.However, the branch of Mr Sweater's business to which it is desired to
especially direct the reader's attention was the Homeworkers
Department.He employed a large number of women making ladies'
blouses, fancy aprons and children's pinafores.Most of these articles
were disposed of wholesale in London and elsewhere, but some were
retailed at 'Sweaters' Emporium' in Mugsborough and at the firm's other
retail establishments throughout the county.Many of the women workers
were widows with children, who were glad to obtain any employment that
did not take them away from their homes and families.The blouses were paid for at the rate of from two shillings to five
shillings a dozen, the women having to provide their own machine and
cotton, besides calling for and delivering the work.These poor women
were able to clear from six to eight shillings a week: and to earn even
that they had to work almost incessantly for fourteen or sixteen hours
a day.There was no time for cooking and very little to cook, for they
lived principally on bread and margarine and tea.Their homes were
squalid, their children half-starved and raggedly clothed in grotesque
garments hastily fashioned out of the cast-off clothes of charitable
neighbours.But it was not in vain that these women toiled every weary day until
exhaustion compelled them to cease.It was not in vain that they passed
their cheerless lives bending with aching shoulders over the thankless
work that barely brought them bread.It was not in vain that they and
their children went famished and in rags, for after all, the principal
object of their labour was accomplished: the Good Cause was advanced.Mr Sweater waxed rich and increased in goods and respectability.Of course, none of those women were COMPELLED to engage in that
glorious cause.No one is compelled to accept any particular set of
conditions in a free country like this.Mr Trafaim--the manager of
Sweater's Homework Department--always put the matter before them in the
plainest, fairest possible way.There was the work: that was the
figure!And those who didn't like it could leave it.Sometimes some perverse creature belonging to that numerous class who
are too lazy to work DID leave it!But as the manager said, there were
plenty of others who were only too glad to take it.In fact, such was
the enthusiasm amongst these women--especially such of them as had
little children to provide for--and such was their zeal for the Cause,
that some of them have been known to positively beg to be allowed to
work!By these and similar means Adam Sweater had contrived to lay up for
himself a large amount of treasure upon earth, besides attaining
undoubted respectability; for that he was respectable no one
questioned.He went to chapel twice every Sunday, his obese figure
arrayed in costly apparel, consisting--with other things--of grey
trousers, a long garment called a frock-coat, a tall silk hat, a
quantity of jewellery and a morocco-bound gilt-edged Bible.He was an
official of some sort of the Shining Light Chapel.His name appeared
in nearly every published list of charitable subscriptions.No
starving wretch had ever appealed to him in vain for a penny soup
ticket.Small wonder that when this good and public-spirited man offered his
services to the town--free of charge--the intelligent working men of
Mugsborough accepted his offer with enthusiastic applause.The fact
that he had made money in business was a proof of his intellectual
capacity.His much-advertised benevolence was a guarantee that his
abilities would be used to further not his own private interests, but
the interests of every section of the community, especially those of
the working classes, of whom the majority of his constituents was
composed.As for the shopkeepers, they were all so absorbed in their own
business--so busily engaged chasing their employees, adding up their
accounts, and dressing themselves up in feeble imitation of the
'Haristocracy'--that they were incapable of taking a really intelligent
interest in anything else.They thought of the Town Council as a kind
of Paradise reserved exclusively for jerry-builders and successful
tradesmen.Possibly, some day, if they succeeded in making money, they
might become town councillors themselves!but in the meantime public
affairs were no particular concern of theirs.So some of them voted
for Adam Sweater because he was a Liberal and some of them voted
against him for the same'reason'.Now and then, when details of some unusually scandalous proceeding of
the Council's leaked out, the townspeople--roused for a brief space
from their customary indifference--would discuss the matter in a
casual, half-indignant, half-amused, helpless sort of way; but always
as if it were something that did not directly concern them.It was
during some such nine days' wonder that the title of 'The Forty
Thieves' was bestowed on the members of the Council by their
semi-imbecile constituents, who, not possessing sufficient intelligence
to devise means of punishing the culprits, affected to regard the
manoeuvres of the Brigands as a huge joke.There was only one member of the Council who did not belong to the
Band--Councillor Weakling, a retired physician; but unfortunately he
also was a respectable man.When he saw something going forwards that
he did not think was right, he protested and voted against it and
then--he collapsed!There was nothing of the low agitator about HIM.As for the Brigands, they laughed at his protests and his vote did not
matter.With this one exception, the other members of the band were very
similar in character to Sweater, Rushton, Didlum and Grinder.They had
all joined the Band with the same objects, self-glorification and the
advancement of their private interests.These were the real reasons
why they besought the ratepayers to elect them to the Council, but of
course none of them ever admitted that such was the case.When
these noble-minded altruists offered their services to the town they
asked the people to believe that they were actuated by a desire to give
their time and abilities for the purpose of furthering the interests of
Others, which was much the same as asking them to believe that it is
possible for the leopard to change his spots.Owing to the extraordinary apathy of the other inhabitants, the
Brigands were able to carry out their depredations undisturbed.For many years these Brigands had looked with greedy eyes upon the huge
profits of the Gas Company.They thought it was a beastly shame that
those other bandits should be always raiding the town and getting clear
away with such rich spoils.At length--about two years ago--after much study and many private
consultations, a plan of campaign was evolved; a secret council of war
was held, presided over by Mr Sweater, and the Brigands formed
themselves into an association called 'The Mugsborough Electric Light
Supply and Installation Coy.', and bound themselves by a solemn
oath to do their best to drive the Gas Works Bandits out of the town
and to capture the spoils at present enjoyed by the latter for
themselves.There was a large piece of ground, the property of the town, that was a
suitable site for the works; so in their character of directors of the
Electric Light Coy.they offered to buy this land from the
Municipality--or, in other words, from themselves--for about half its
value.At the meeting of the Town Council when this offer was considered, all
the members present, with the solitary exception of Dr Weakling, being
shareholders in the newly formed company, Councillor Rushton moved a
resolution in favour of accepting it.He said that every encouragement
should be given to the promoters of the Electric Light Coy., those
public-spirited citizens who had come forward and were willing to risk
their capital in an undertaking that would be a benefit to every class
of residents in the town that they all loved so well.There could be no doubt that the introduction of the electric light
would be a great addition to the attractions of Mugsborough, but there
was another and more urgent reason that disposed him to do whatever he
could to encourage the Company to proceed with this work.Unfortunately, as was usual at that time of the year (Mr Rushton's
voice trembled with emotion) the town was full of unemployed.(The
Mayor, Alderman Sweater, and all the other Councillors shook their
heads sadly; they were visibly affected.)There was no doubt that the
starting of that work at that time would be an inestimable boon to the
working-classes.As the representative of a working-class ward he was
in favour of accepting the offer of the Company.In his opinion, it would be nothing short
of a crime to oppose anything that would provide work for the
unemployed.Councillor Weakling moved that the offer be refused.He
admitted that the electric light would be an improvement to the town,
and in view of the existing distress he would be glad to see the work
started, but the price mentioned was altogether too low.It was not
more than half the value of the land.Councillor Grinder said he was astonished at the attitude taken up by
Councillor Weakling.In his (Grinder's) opinion it was disgraceful
that a member of the council should deliberately try to wreck a project
which would do so much towards relieving the unemployed.The Mayor, Alderman Sweater, said that he could not allow the amendment
to be discussed until it was seconded: if there were no seconder he
would put the original motion.There was no seconder, because everyone except Weakling was in favour
of the resolution, which was carried amid loud cheers, and the
representatives of the ratepayers proceeded to the consideration of the
next business.Councillor Didlum proposed that the duty on all coal brought into the
borough be raised from two shillings to three shillings per ton.The largest consumer of coal was the Gas
Coy., and, considering the great profits made by that company, they
were quite justified in increasing the duty to the highest figure the
Act permitted.After a feeble protest from Weakling, who said it would only increase
the price of gas and coal without interfering with the profits of the
Gas Coy., this was also carried, and after some other business had been
transacted, the Band dispersed.That meeting was held two years ago, and since that time the Electric
Light Works had been built and the war against the gasworks carried on
vigorously.After several encounters, in which they lost a few
customers and a portion of the public lighting, the Gasworks Bandits
retreated out of the town and entrenched themselves in a strong
position beyond the borough boundary, where they erected a number of
gasometers.They were thus enabled to pour gas into the town at long
range without having to pay the coal dues.This masterly stratagem created something like a panic in the ranks of
the Forty Thieves.At the end of two years they found themselves
exhausted with the protracted campaign, their movements hampered by a
lot of worn-out plant and antiquated machinery, and harassed on every
side by the lower charges of the Gas Coy.They were reluctantly
constrained to admit that the attempt to undermine the Gasworks was a
melancholy failure, and that the Mugsborough Electric Light and
Installation Coy.They began to ask
themselves what they should do with it; and some of them even urged
unconditional surrender, or an appeal to the arbitration of the
Bankruptcy Court.In the midst of all the confusion and demoralization there was,
however, one man who did not lose his presence of mind, who in this
dark hour of disaster remained calm and immovable, and like a vast
mountain of flesh reared his head above the storm, whose mighty
intellect perceived a way to turn this apparently hopeless defeat into
a glorious victory.That man was Adam Sweater, the Chief of the Band.The Great Money Trick


During the next four weeks the usual reign of terror continued at 'The
Cave'.The men slaved like so many convicts under the vigilant
surveillance of Crass, Misery and Rushton.No one felt free from
observation for a single moment.It happened frequently that a man who
was working alone--as he thought--on turning round would find Hunter or
Rushton standing behind him: or one would look up from his work to
catch sight of a face watching him through a door or a window or over
the banisters.If they happened to be working in a room on the ground
floor, or at a window on any floor, they knew that both Rushton and
Hunter were in the habit of hiding among the trees that surrounded the
house, and spying upon them thus.There was a plumber working outside repairing the guttering that ran
round the bottom edge of the roof.This poor wretch's life was a
perfect misery: he fancied he saw Hunter or Rushton in every bush.He
had two ladders to work from, and since these ladders had been in use
Misery had thought of a new way of spying on the men.Finding that he
never succeeded in catching anyone doing anything wrong when he entered
the house by one of the doors, Misery adopted the plan of crawling up
one of the ladders, getting in through one of the upper windows and
creeping softly downstairs and in and out of the rooms.Even then he
never caught anyone, but that did not matter, for he accomplished his
principal purpose--every man seemed afraid to cease working for even an
instant.The result of all this was, of course, that the work progressed rapidly
towards completion.The hands grumbled and cursed, but all the same
every man tore into it for all he was worth.Although he did next to
nothing himself, Crass watched and urged on the others.He was 'in
charge of the job': he knew that unless he succeeded in making this
work pay he would not be put in charge of another job.On the other
hand, if he did make it pay he would be given the preference over
others and be kept on as long as the firm had any work.The firm would
give him the preference only as long as it paid them to do so.As for the hands, each man knew that there was no chance of obtaining
work anywhere else at present; there were dozens of men out of
employment already.Besides, even if there had been a chance of getting
another job somewhere else, they knew that the conditions were more or
less the same on every firm.Each
man knew that unless he did as much as ever he could, Crass would
report him for being slow.They knew also that when the job began to
draw to a close the number of men employed upon it would be reduced,
and when that time came the hands who did the most work would be kept
on and the slower ones discharged.It was therefore in the hope of
being one of the favoured few that while inwardly cursing the rest for
'tearing into it', everyone as a matter of self-preservation went and
'tore into it' themselves.They all cursed Crass, but most of them would have been very glad to
change places with him: and if any one of them had been in his place
they would have been compelled to act in the same way--or lose the job.They all reviled Hunter, but most of them would have been glad to
change places with him also: and if any one of them had been in his
place they would have been compelled to do the same things, or lose the
job.Yet if they had been in Rushton's
place they would have been compelled to adopt the same methods, or
become bankrupt: for it is obvious that the only way to compete
successfully against other employers who are sweaters is to be a
sweater yourself.Therefore no one who is an upholder of the present
system can consistently blame any of these men.If you, reader, had been one of the hands, would you have slogged?Or
would you have preferred to starve and see your family starve?If you
had been in Crass's place, would you have resigned rather than do such
dirty work?If you had had Hunter's berth, would you have given it up
and voluntarily reduced yourself to the level of the hands?If you had
been Rushton, would you rather have become bankrupt than treat your
'hands' and your customers in the same way as your competitors treated
theirs?It may be that, so placed, you--being the noble-minded paragon
that you are--would have behaved unselfishly.But no one has any right
to expect you to sacrifice yourself for the benefit of other people who
would only call you a fool for your pains.It may be true that if any
one of the hands--Owen, for instance--had been an employer of labour,
he would have done the same as other employers.Some people seem to
think that proves that the present system is all right!But really it
only proves that the present system compels selfishness.One must
either trample upon others or be trampled upon oneself.Happiness
might be possible if everyone were unselfish; if everyone thought of
the welfare of his neighbour before thinking of his own.But as there
is only a very small percentage of such unselfish people in the world,
the present system has made the earth into a sort of hell.Under the
present system there is not sufficient of anything for everyone to have
enough.Consequently there is a fight--called by Christians the
'Battle of Life'.In this fight some get more than they need, some
barely enough, some very little, and some none at all.The more
aggressive, cunning, unfeeling and selfish you are the better it will
be for you.As long as this 'Battle of Life' System endures, we have
no right to blame other people for doing the same things that we are
ourselves compelled to do.But that IS just what the hands did not do.They blamed each other;
they blamed Crass, and Hunter, and Rushton, but with the Great System
of which they were all more or less the victims they were quite
content, being persuaded that it was the only one possible and the best
that human wisdom could devise.The reason why they all believed this
was because not one of them had ever troubled to inquire whether it
would not be possible to order things differently.If they had not been content they would have
been anxious to find some way to alter it.But they had never taken
the trouble to seriously inquire whether it was possible to find some
better way, and although they all knew in a hazy fashion that other
methods of managing the affairs of the world had already been proposed,
they neglected to inquire whether these other methods were possible or
practicable, and they were ready and willing to oppose with ignorant
ridicule or brutal force any man who was foolish or quixotic enough to
try to explain to them the details of what he thought was a better way.They accepted the present system in the same way as they accepted the
alternating seasons.They knew that there was spring and summer and
autumn and winter.As to how these different seasons came to be, or
what caused them, they hadn't the remotest notion, and it is extremely
doubtful whether the question had ever occurred to any of them: but
there is no doubt whatever about the fact that none of them knew.From
their infancy they had been trained to distrust their own intelligence,
and to leave the management of the affairs of the world--and for that
matter of the next world too--to their betters; and now most of them
were absolutely incapable of thinking of any abstract subject whatever.Nearly all their betters--that is, the people who do nothing--were
unanimous in agreeing that the present system is a very good one and
that it is impossible to alter or improve it.Therefore Crass and his
mates, although they knew nothing whatever about it themselves,
accepted it as an established, incontrovertible fact that the existing
state of things is immutable.They believed it because someone else
told them so.They would have believed anything: on one
condition--namely, that they were told to believe it by their betters.They said it was surely not for the Like of Them to think that they
knew better than those who were more educated and had plenty of time to
study.As the work in the drawing-room proceeded, Crass abandoned the hope
that Owen was going to make a mess of it.Some of the rooms upstairs
being now ready for papering, Slyme was started on that work, Bert
being taken away from Owen to assist Slyme as paste boy, and it was
arranged that Crass should help Owen whenever he needed someone to lend
him a hand.Sweater came frequently during these four weeks, being interested in
the progress of the work.On these occasions Crass always managed to
be present in the drawing-room and did most of the talking.Owen was
very satisfied with this arrangement, for he was always ill at ease
when conversing with a man like Sweater, who spoke in an offensively
patronizing way and expected common people to kowtow to and 'Sir' him
at every second word.Crass however, seemed to enjoy doing that kind
of thing.He did not exactly grovel on the floor, when Sweater spoke
to him, but he contrived to convey the impression that he was willing
to do so if desired.Outside the house Bundy and his mates had dug deep trenches in the damp
ground in which they were laying new drains.This work, like that of
the painting of the inside of the house, was nearly completed.Owing to the fact that there had been a spell of bad
weather the ground was sodden with rain and there was mud everywhere,
the men's clothing and boots being caked with it.But the worst thing
about the job was the smell.For years the old drain-pipes had been
defective and leaky.The ground a few feet below the surface was
saturated with fetid moisture and a stench as of a thousand putrefying
corpse emanated from the opened earth.The clothing of the men who
were working in the trenches became saturated with this fearful odour,
and for that matter, so did the men themselves.They said they could smell and taste it all the time, even when they
were away from the work at home, and when they were at meals.Although
they smoked their pipes all the time they were at work, Misery having
ungraciously given them permission, several times Bundy and one or
other of his mates were attacked with fits of vomiting.But, as they began to realize that the finish of the job was in sight,
a kind of panic seized upon the hands, especially those who had been
taken on last and who would therefore be the first to be'stood still'.Easton, however, felt pretty confident that Crass would do his best to
get him kept on till the end of the job, for they had become quite
chummy lately, usually spending a few evenings together at the
Cricketers every week.'There'll be a bloody slaughter 'ere soon,' remarked Harlow to Philpot
one day as they were painting the banisters of the staircase.'I
reckon next week will about finish the inside.''And the outside ain't goin' to take very long, you know,' replied
Philpot.'They ain't got no other work in, have they?''Not that I knows of,' replied Philpot gloomily; 'and I don't think
anyone else has either.''You know that little place they call the "Kiosk" down the Grand
Parade, near the bandstand,' asked Harlow after a pause.'Yes; it belongs to the Corporation, you know.''It's been closed up lately, ain't it?''Yes; the people who 'ad it couldn't make it pay; but I 'eard last
night that Grinder the fruit-merchant is goin' to open it again.If
it's true, there'll be a bit of a job there for someone, because it'll
'ave to be done up.''Well, I hope it does come orf replied Philpot.'It'll be a job for
some poor b--rs.''I wonder if they've started anyone yet on the venetian blinds for this
'ouse?''I don't know,' replied Philpot.'I don't know 'ow
you feel, but I begin to want my dinner.''That's just what I was thinking; it can't be very far off it now.It's
nearly 'arf an hour since Bert went down to make the tea.It seems a
'ell of a long morning to me.''So it does to me,' said Philpot; 'slip upstairs and ask Slyme what
time it is.'Harlow laid his brush across the top of his paint-pot and went
upstairs.He was wearing a pair of cloth slippers, and walked softly,
not wishing that Crass should hear him leaving his work, so it happened
that without any intention of spying on Slyme, Harlow reached the door
of the room in which the former was working without being heard and,
entering suddenly, surprised Slyme--who was standing near the
fireplace--in the act of breaking a whole roll of wallpaper across his
knee as one might break a stick.On the floor beside him was what had
been another roll, now broken into two pieces.When Harlow came in,
Slyme started, and his face became crimson with confusion.He hastily
gathered the broken rolls together and, stooping down, thrust the
pieces up the flue of the grate and closed the register.Slyme laughed with an affectation of carelessness, but his hands
trembled and his face was now very pale.'We must get our own back somehow, you know, Fred,' he said.After puzzling over it
for a few minutes, he gave it up.'Fifteen minutes to twelve,' said Slyme and added, as Harlow was going
away: 'Don't mention anything about that paper to Crass or any of the
others.''I shan't say nothing,' replied Harlow.Gradually, as he pondered over it, Harlow began to comprehend the
meaning of the destruction of the two rolls of paper.Slyme was doing
the paperhanging piecework--so much for each roll hung.Four of the
rooms upstairs had been done with the same pattern, and Hunter--who was
not over-skilful in such matters--had evidently sent more paper than
was necessary.By getting rid of these two rolls, Slyme would be able
to make it appear that he had hung two rolls more than was really the
case.He had broken the rolls so as to be able to take them away from
the house without being detected, and he had hidden them up the chimney
until he got an opportunity of so doing.Harlow had just arrived at
this solution of the problem when, hearing the lower flight of stairs
creaking, he peeped over and observed Misery crawling up.He had come
to see if anyone had stopped work before the proper time.Passing the
two workmen without speaking, he ascended to the next floor, and
entered the room where Slyme was.'You'd better not do this room yet,' said Hunter.'There's to be a new
grate and mantelpiece put in.'He crossed over to the fireplace and stood looking at it thoughtfully
for a few minutes.'It's not a bad little grate, you know, is it?''We'll be
able to use it somewhere or other.''Yes; it's all right,' said Slyme, whose heart was beating like a
steam-hammer.'Do for a front room in a cottage,' continued Misery, stooping down to
examine it more closely.'There's nothing broke that I can see.'He put his hand against the register and vainly tried to push it open.'H'm, there's something wrong 'ere,' he remarked, pushing harder.'Most likely a brick or some plaster fallen down,' gasped Slyme, coming
to Misery's assistance.'Don't trouble,' replied Nimrod, rising to his feet.'It's most likely
what you say.I'll see that the new grate is sent up after dinner.Bundy can fix it this afternoon and then you can go on papering as soon
as you like.'With this, Misery went out of the room, downstairs and away from the
house, and Slyme wiped the sweat from his forehead with his
handkerchief.Then he knelt down and, opening the register, he took
out the broken rolls of paper and hid them up the chimney of the next
room.While he was doing this the sound of Crass's whistle shrilled
through the house.exclaimed Philpot fervently as he laid his brushes on the
top of his pot and joined in the general rush to the kitchen.The
scene here is already familiar to the reader.For seats, the two pairs
of steps laid on their sides parallel to each other, about eight feet
apart and at right angles to the fireplace, with the long plank placed
across; and the upturned pails and the drawers of the dresser.The
floor unswept and littered with dirt, scraps of paper, bits of plaster,
pieces of lead pipe and dried mud; and in the midst, the steaming
bucket of stewed tea and the collection of cracked cups, jam-jam and
condensed milk tins.And on the seats the men in their shabby and in
some cases ragged clothing sitting and eating their coarse food and
cracking jokes.It was a pathetic and wonderful and at the same time a despicable
spectacle.Pathetic that human beings should be condemned to spend the
greater part of their lives amid such surroundings, because it must be
remembered that most of their time was spent on some job or other.When 'The Cave' was finished they would go to some similar 'job', if
they were lucky enough to find one.Wonderful, because although they
knew that they did more than their fair share of the great work of
producing the necessaries and comforts of life, they did not think they
were entitled to a fair share of the good things they helped to create!And despicable, because although they saw their children condemned to
the same life of degradation, hard labour and privation, yet they
refused to help to bring about a better state of affairs.Most of them
thought that what had been good enough for themselves was good enough
for their children.It seemed as if they regarded their own children with a kind of
contempt, as being only fit to grow up to be the servants of the
children of such people as Rushton and Sweater.But it must be
remembered that they had been taught self-contempt when they were
children.In the so-called 'Christian' schools they attended then
they were taught to 'order themselves lowly and reverently towards
their betters', and they were now actually sending their own children
to learn the same degrading lessons in their turn!They had a vast
amount of consideration for their betters, and for the children of
their betters, but very little for their own children, for each other,
or for themselves.That was why they sat there in their rags and ate their coarse food,
and cracked their coarser jokes, and drank the dreadful tea, and were
content!So long as they had Plenty of Work and plenty
of--Something--to eat, and somebody else's cast-off clothes to wear,
they were content!They agreed and assured each other that the good things of life were
not intended for the 'Likes of them', or their children.asked the gentleman who sat on the
upturned pail in the corner, referring to Owen, who had not yet come
down from his work.'P'raps 'e's preparing 'is sermon,' remarked Harlow with a laugh.'We ain't 'ad no lectures from 'im lately, since 'e's been on that
room,' observed Easton.'It gives me the pip to 'ear
'im, the same old thing over and over again.''Poor ole Frank,' remarked Harlow.''E does upset 'isself about
things, don't 'e?''I'll take bloody good care I don't go
worryin' myself to death like 'e's doin', about such dam rot as that.''I do believe that's wot makes 'im look so bad as 'e does,' observed
Harlow.'Several times this morning I couldn't help noticing the way
'e kept on coughing.''I thought 'e seemed to be a bit better lately,' Philpot observed;
'more cheerful and happier like, and more inclined for a bit of fun.''He's a funny sort of chap, ain't he?''One day quite
jolly, singing and cracking jokes and tellin' yarns, and the next you
can't hardly get a word out of 'im.''Bloody rot, I call it,' chimed in the man on the pail.'Wot the
'ell's the use of the likes of us troublin' our 'eads about politics?''We've got votes and we're
really the people what control the affairs of the country, so I reckon
we ought to take SOME interest in it, but at the same time I can't see
no sense in this 'ere Socialist wangle that Owen's always talkin'
about.''Nor nobody else neither,' said Crass with a jeering laugh.'Even if all the bloody money in the world WAS divided out equal,' said
the man on the pail, profoundly, 'it wouldn't do no good!In six
months' time it would be all back in the same 'ands again.''But 'e 'ad a cuff the other day about money bein' no good at all!''Don't you remember 'e said as money was the
principal cause of poverty?''So it is the principal cause of poverty,' said Owen, who entered at
that moment.shouted Philpot, leading off a cheer which the others took
up.'The Professor 'as arrived and will now proceed to say a few
remarks.'A roar of merriment greeted this sally.'Let's 'ave our bloody dinner first, for Christ's sake,' appealed
Harlow, with mock despair.As Owen, having filled his cup with tea, sat down in his usual place,
Philpot rose solemnly to his feet, and, looking round the company, said:

'Genelmen, with your kind permission, as soon as the Professor 'as
finished 'is dinner 'e will deliver 'is well-known lecture, entitled,
"Money the Principal Cause of being 'ard up", proving as money ain't no
good to nobody.At the hend of the lecture a collection will be took
up to provide the lecturer with a little encouragement.'Philpot
resumed his seat amid cheers.As soon as they had finished eating, some of the men began to make
remarks about the lecture, but Owen only laughed and went on reading
the piece of newspaper that his dinner had been wrapped in.Usually
most of the men went out for a walk after dinner, but as it happened to
be raining that day they were determined, if possible, to make Owen
fulfill the engagement made in his name by Philpot.'Let's 'oot 'im,' said Harlow, and the suggestion was at once acted
upon; howls, groans and catcalls filled the air, mingled with cries of
'Fraud!''Come on 'ere,' cried Philpot, putting his hand on Owen's shoulder.'Prove that money is the cause of poverty.''It's one thing to say it and another to prove it,' sneered Crass, who
was anxious for an opportunity to produce the long-deferred Obscurer
cutting.'Money IS the real cause of poverty,' said Owen.'Money is the cause of poverty because it is the device by which those
who are too lazy to work are enabled to rob the workers of the fruits
of their labours.'Owen slowly folded up the piece of newspaper he had been reading and
put it into his pocket.'I'll show you how the Great Money Trick is
worked.'Owen opened his dinner basket and took from it two slices of bread but
as these were not sufficient, he requested that anyone who had some
bread left would give it to him.They gave him several pieces, which
he placed in a heap on a clean piece of paper, and, having borrowed the
pocket knives they used to cut and eat their dinners with from Easton,
Harlow and Philpot, he addressed them as follows:

'These pieces of bread represent the raw materials which exist
naturally in and on the earth for the use of mankind; they were not
made by any human being, but were created by the Great Spirit for the
benefit and sustenance of all, the same as were the air and the light
of the sun.''You're about as fair-speakin' a man as I've met for some time,' said
Harlow, winking at the others.'Now,' continued Owen, 'I am a capitalist; or, rather, I represent the
landlord and capitalist class.That is to say, all these raw materials
belong to me.It does not matter for our present argument how I
obtained possession of them, or whether I have any real right to them;
the only thing that matters now is the admitted fact that all the raw
materials which are necessary for the production of the necessaries of
life are now the property of the Landlord and Capitalist class.I am
that class: all these raw materials belong to me.''Now you three represent the Working class: you have nothing--and for
my part, although I have all these raw materials, they are of no use to
me--what I need is--the things that can be made out of these raw
materials by Work: but as I am too lazy to work myself, I have invented
the Money Trick to make you work FOR me.But first I must explain that
I possess something else beside the raw materials.These three knives
represent--all the machinery of production; the factories, tools,
railways, and so forth, without which the necessaries of life cannot be
produced in abundance.And these three coins'--taking three
halfpennies from his pocket--'represent my Money Capital.''But before we go any further,' said Owen, interrupting himself, 'it is
most important that you remember that I am not supposed to be merely
"a" capitalist.You are not
supposed to be just three workers--you represent the whole Working
Class.''All right, all right,' said Crass, impatiently, 'we all understand
that.Owen proceeded to cut up one of the slices of bread into a number of
little square blocks.'These represent the things which are produced by labour, aided by
machinery, from the raw materials.We will suppose that three of these
blocks represent--a week's work.We will suppose that a week's work is
worth--one pound: and we will suppose that each of these ha'pennies is
a sovereign.We'd be able to do the trick better if we had real
sovereigns, but I forgot to bring any with me.''I'd lend you some,' said Philpot, regretfully, 'but I left me purse on
our grand pianner.'As by a strange coincidence nobody happened to have any gold with them,
it was decided to make shift with the halfpence.'Now this is the way the trick works--'

'Before you goes on with it,' interrupted Philpot, apprehensively,
'don't you think we'd better 'ave someone to keep watch at the gate in
case a Slop comes along?We don't want to get runned in, you know.''I don't think there's any need for that,' replied Owen, 'there's only
one slop who'd interfere with us for playing this game, and that's
Police Constable Socialism.''Never mind about Socialism,' said Crass, irritably.Owen now addressed himself to the working classes as represented by
Philpot, Harlow and Easton.'You say that you are all in need of employment, and as I am the
kind-hearted capitalist class I am going to invest all my money in
various industries, so as to give you Plenty of Work.I shall pay each
of you one pound per week, and a week's work is--you must each produce
three of these square blocks.For doing this work you will each
receive your wages; the money will be your own, to do as you like with,
and the things you produce will of course be mine, to do as I like
with.You will each take one of these machines and as soon as you have
done a week's work, you shall have your money.'The Working Classes accordingly set to work, and the Capitalist class
sat down and watched them.As soon as they had finished, they passed
the nine little blocks to Owen, who placed them on a piece of paper by
his side and paid the workers their wages.'These blocks represent the necessaries of life.You can't live
without some of these things, but as they belong to me, you will have
to buy them from me: my price for these blocks is--one pound each.'As the working classes were in need of the necessaries of life and as
they could not eat, drink or wear the useless money, they were
compelled to agree to the kind Capitalist's terms.They each bought
back and at once consumed one-third of the produce of their labour.The
capitalist class also devoured two of the square blocks, and so the net
result of the week's work was that the kind capitalist had consumed two
pounds worth of the things produced by the labour of the others, and
reckoning the squares at their market value of one pound each, he had
more than doubled his capital, for he still possessed the three pounds
in money and in addition four pounds worth of goods.As for the
working classes, Philpot, Harlow and Easton, having each consumed the
pound's worth of necessaries they had bought with their wages, they
were again in precisely the same condition as when they started
work--they had nothing.This process was repeated several times: for each week's work the
producers were paid their wages.They kept on working and spending all
their earnings.The kind-hearted capitalist consumed twice as much as
any one of them and his pile of wealth continually increased.In a
little while--reckoning the little squares at their market value of one
pound each--he was worth about one hundred pounds, and the working
classes were still in the same condition as when they began, and were
still tearing into their work as if their lives depended upon it.After a while the rest of the crowd began to laugh, and their merriment
increased when the kind-hearted capitalist, just after having sold a
pound's worth of necessaries to each of his workers, suddenly took
their tools--the Machinery of Production--the knives away from them,
and informed them that as owing to Over Production all his store-houses
were glutted with the necessaries of life, he had decided to close down
the works.'Well, and wot the bloody 'ell are we to do now?''That's not my business,' replied the kind-hearted capitalist.'I've
paid you your wages, and provided you with Plenty of Work for a long
time past.I have no more work for you to do at present.Come round
again in a few months' time and I'll see what I can do for you.''But what about the necessaries of life?''Of course you must,' replied the capitalist, affably; 'and I shall be
very pleased to sell you some.''But we ain't got no bloody money!''Well, you can't expect me to give you my goods for nothing!You
didn't work for me for nothing, you know.I paid you for your work and
you should have saved something: you should have been thrifty like me.Look how I have got on by being thrifty!'The unemployed looked blankly at each other, but the rest of the crowd
only laughed; and then the three unemployed began to abuse the
kind-hearted Capitalist, demanding that he should give them some of the
necessaries of life that he had piled up in his warehouses, or to be
allowed to work and produce some more for their own needs; and even
threatened to take some of the things by force if he did not comply
with their demands.But the kind-hearted Capitalist told them not to
be insolent, and spoke to them about honesty, and said if they were not
careful he would have their faces battered in for them by the police,
or if necessary he would call out the military and have them shot down
like dogs, the same as he had done before at Featherstone and Belfast.'Of course,' continued the kind-hearted capitalist, 'if it were not for
foreign competition I should be able to sell these things that you have
made, and then I should be able to give you Plenty of Work again: but
until I have sold them to somebody or other, or until I have used them
myself, you will have to remain idle.''Well, this takes the bloody biskit, don't it?''The only thing as I can see for it,' said Philpot mournfully, 'is to
'ave a unemployed procession.''That's the idear,' said Harlow, and the three began to march about the
room in Indian file, singing:

        'We've got no work to do-oo-oo'
        We've got no work to do-oo-oo!Just because we've been workin' a dam sight too hard,
        Now we've got no work to do.'As they marched round, the crowd jeered at them and made offensive
remarks.Crass said that anyone could see that they were a lot of
lazy, drunken loafers who had never done a fair day's work in their
lives and never intended to.'We shan't never get nothing like this, you know,' said Philpot.cried Philpot after a moment's deliberation.The three unemployed accordingly resumed their march round the room,
singing mournfully and imitating the usual whine of street-singers:

        'Trim your fee-bil lamp me brither-in,
        Some poor sail-er tempest torst,
        Strugglin' 'ard to save the 'arb-er,
        Hin the dark-niss may be lorst,
        So let try lower lights be burning,
        Send 'er gleam acrost the wave,
        Some poor shipwrecked, struggling seaman,
        You may rescue, you may save.''Kind frens,' said Philpot, removing his cap and addressing the crowd,
'we're hall honest British workin' men, but we've been hout of work for
the last twenty years on account of foreign competition and
over-production.We don't come hout 'ere because we're too lazy to
work; it's because we can't get a job.If it wasn't for foreign
competition, the kind'earted Hinglish capitalists would be able to sell
their goods and give us Plenty of Work, and if they could, I assure you
that we should hall be perfectly willing and contented to go on workin'
our bloody guts out for the benefit of our masters for the rest of our
lives.We're quite willin' to work: that's hall we arst for--Plenty of
Work--but as we can't get it we're forced to come out 'ere and arst you
to spare a few coppers towards a crust of bread and a night's lodgin'.'As Philpot held out his cap for subscriptions, some of them attempted
to expectorate into it, but the more charitable put in pieces of cinder
or dirt from the floor, and the kind-hearted capitalist was so affected
by the sight of their misery that he gave them one of the sovereigns he
had in us pocket: but as this was of no use to them they immediately
returned it to him in exchange for one of the small squares of the
necessaries of life, which they divided and greedily devoured.And
when they had finished eating they gathered round the philanthropist
and sang, 'For he's a jolly good fellow,' and afterwards Harlow
suggested that they should ask him if he would allow them to elect him
to Parliament.Chapter 22

The Phrenologist


The following morning--Saturday--the men went about their work in
gloomy silence; there were but few attempts at conversation and no
jests or singing.The tenor of the impending slaughter pervaded the
house.Even those who were confident of being spared and kept on till
the job was finished shared the general depression, not only out of
sympathy for the doomed, but because they knew that a similar fate
awaited themselves a little later on.They all waited anxiously for Nimrod to come, but hour after hour
dragged slowly by and he did not arrive.At half past eleven some of
those who had made up their minds that they were to be'stood still'
began to hope that the slaughter was to be deferred for a few days:
after all, there was plenty of work still to be done: even if all hands
were kept on, the job could scarcely be finished in another week.Anyhow, it would not be very long now before they would know one way or
the other.If he did not come before twelve, it was all right: all the
hands were paid by the hour and were therefore entitled to an hour's
notice.Easton and Harlow were working together on the staircase, finishing the
doors and other woodwork with white enamel.The men had not been
allowed to spend the time necessary to prepare this work in a proper
manner, it had not been rubbed down smooth or properly filled up, and
it had not had a sufficient number of coats of paint to make it solid
white.Now that the glossy enamel was put on, the work looked rather
rough and shady.'It ain't 'arf all right, ain't it?'remarked Harlow, sarcastically,
indicating the door he had just finished.Easton laughed: 'I can't understand how people pass such work,' he said.'Old Sweater did make some remark about it the other day,' replied
Harlow, 'and I heard Misery tell 'im it was impossible to make a
perfect job of such old doors.''I believe that man's the biggest liar Gord ever made,' said Easton, an
opinion in which Harlow entirely concurred.'I don't know exactly,' replied Easton, 'but it can't be far off
twelve.'''E don't seem to be comin', does 'e?''No: and I shouldn't be surprised if 'e didn't turn up at all, now.P'raps 'e don't mean to stop nobody today after all.'They spoke in hushed tones and glanced cautiously about them fearful of
being heard or observed.'This is a bloody life, ain't it?''Workin' our
guts out like a lot of slaves for the benefit of other people, and then
as soon as they've done with you, you're chucked aside like a dirty
rag.''Yes: and I begin to think that a great deal of what Owen says is true.But for my part I can't see 'ow it's ever goin' to be altered, can you?'But whether it can be altered or not, there's
one thing very certain; it won't be done in our time.'Neither of them seemed to think that if the 'alteration' they spoke of
were to be accomplished at all they themselves would have to help to
bring it about.'I wonder what they're doin' about the venetian blinds?''Is there anyone doin' em yet?''I don't know; ain't 'eard nothing about 'em since the boy took 'em to
the shop.'There was quite a mystery about these blinds.About a month ago they
were taken to the paint-shop down at the yard to be repainted and
re-harnessed, and since then nothing had been heard of them by the men
working at the 'Cave'.'P'hap's a couple of us will be sent there to do 'em next week,'
remarked Harlow.Most likely they'll 'ave to be done in a bloody 'urry at
the last minute.'Presently Harlow--who was very anxious to know what time it was--went
downstairs to ask Slyme.From the window of the room where Slyme was papering, one could see
into the front garden.Harlow paused a moment to watch Bundy and the
labourers, who were still working in the trenches at the drains, and as
he looked out he saw Hunter approaching the house.Harlow drew back
hastily and returned to his work, and as he went he passed the word to
the other men, warning them of the approach of Misery.Hunter entered in his usual manner and, after crawling quietly about
the house for about ten minutes, he went into the drawing room.'I see you're putting the finishing touches on at last,' he said.'I've only got this bit of outlining to do now.''Ah, well, it looks very nice, of course,' said Misery in a voice of
mourning, 'but we've lost money over it.It's taken you a week longer
to do than we allowed for; you said three weeks and it's taken you a
month; and we only allowed for fifteen books of gold, but you've been
and used twenty-three.''You can hardly blame me for that, you know,' answered Owen.'I could
have got it done in the three weeks, but Mr Rushton told me not to
hurry for the sake of a day or two, because he wanted a good job.He
said he would rather lose a little over it than spoil it; and as for
the extra gold, that was also his order.''Well, I suppose it can't be helped,' whined Misery.'Anyhow, I'm very
glad it's done, because this kind of work don't pay.We'll 'ave you
back on the brush on Monday morning; we want to get outside done next
week if it keeps fine.'The 'brush' alluded to by Nimrod was the large 'pound' brush used in
ordinary painting.Misery now began wandering about the house, in and out of the rooms,
sometimes standing for several minutes silently watching the hands as
they worked.As he watched them the men became nervous and awkward,
each one dreading that he might be one of those who were to be paid off
at one o'clock.At about five minutes to twelve Hunter went down to the paint-shop--the
scullery--where Crass was mixing some colour, and getting ready some
'empties' to be taken to the yard.'I suppose the b--r's gone to ask Crass which of us is the least use,'
whispered Harlow to Easton.'I wouldn't be surprised if it was you and me, for two,' replied the
latter in the same tone.'You can't trust Crass you know, for all 'e
seems so friendly to our faces.You never know what 'e ses behind our
backs.''You may be sure it won't be Sawkins or any of the other light-weights,
because Nimrod won't want to pay us sixpence ha'penny for painting
guttering and rainpipes when THEY can do it near enough for fourpence
ha'penny and fivepence.They won't be able to do the sashes, though,
will they?''I don't know so much about that,' replied Easton.'Anything seems to
be good enough for Hunter.'said Harlow, and they both relapsed into
silence and busied themselves with their work.Misery stood watching
them for some time without speaking, and then went out of the house.They crept cautiously to the window of a room that overlooked the
garden and, peeping furtively out, they saw him standing on the brink
of one of the trenches, moodily watching Bundy and his mates as they
toiled at the drains.Then, to their surprise and relief, he turned
and went out of the gate!They just caught sight of one of the wheels
of his bicycle as he rode away.The slaughter was evidently to be put off until next week!'P'hap's 'e's left a message for some of us with Crass?''I don't think it's likely, but it's just possible.''Well, I'm goin' down to ask 'im,' said Harlow, desperately.'We may
as well know the worst at once.'He returned in a few minutes with the information that Hunter had
decided not to stop anyone that day because he wanted to get the
outside finished during the next week, if possible.The hands received this intelligence with mixed feelings, because
although it left them safe for the present, it meant that nearly
everybody would certainly be stopped next Saturday, if not before;
whereas if a few had been sacked today it would have made it all the
better for the rest.Still, this aspect of the business did not
greatly interfere with the relief that they all felt at knowing that
the immediate danger was over; and the fact that it was
Saturday--pay-day--also served to revive their drooping spirits.They
all felt pretty certain that Misery would return no more that day, and
presently Harlow began to sing the old favourite.the refrain of which was soon taken up by nearly everyone
in the house:

        'Work!for the night is coming,
        Work in the morning hours.for the night is coming,
        Work'mid springing flowers.'Work while the dew is sparkling,
        Work in the noonday sun!for the night is coming
        When man's work is done!'When this hymn was finished, someone else, imitating the whine of a
street-singer, started, 'Oh, where is my wandering boy tonight?'and
then Harlow--who by some strange chance had a penny--took it out of his
pocket and dropped it on the floor, the ringing of the coin being
greeted with shouts of 'Thank you, kind lady,' from several of the
singers.This little action of Harlow's was the means of bringing a
most extraordinary circumstance to light.Although it was Saturday
morning, several of the others had pennies or half-pence!and at the
conclusion of each verse they all followed Harlow's example and the
house resounded with the ringing of falling coins, cries of 'Thank you,
kind lady,' 'Thank you, sir,' and 'Gord bless you,' mingled with shouts
of laughter.'My wandering boy' was followed by a choice selection of choruses of
well-known music-hall songs, including 'Goodbye, my Bluebell', 'The
Honeysuckle and the Bee', 'I've got 'em!'and 'The Church Parade', the
whole being tastefully varied and interspersed with howls, shrieks,
curses, catcalls, and downward explosions of flatulence.In the midst of the uproar Crass came upstairs.Suppose Nimrod
was to come back!''Oh, he ain't comin' any more today,' said Harlow, recklessly.'Besides, what if 'e does come?''Well, we never know; and for that matter Rushton or Sweater might come
at any minit.'With this, Crass went muttering back to the scullery, and the men
relapsed into their usual silence.At ten minutes to one they all ceased work, put away their colours and
locked up the house.There were a number of 'empties' to be taken away
and left at the yard on their way to the office; these Crass divided
amongst the others--carrying nothing himself--and then they all set out
for the office to get their money, cracking jokes as they went along.Harlow and Easton enlivened the journey by coughing significantly
whenever they met a young woman, and audibly making some complimentary
remark about her personal appearance.If the girl smiled, each of them
eagerly claimed to have'seen her first', but if she appeared offended
or'stuck up', they suggested that she was cross-cut or that she had
been eating vinegar with a fork.Now and then they kissed their hands
affectionately to servant-girls whom they saw looking out of windows.Some of these girls laughed, others looked indignant, but whichever way
they took it was equally amusing to Crass and the rest, who were like a
crowd of boys just let out of school.It will be remembered that there was a back door to Rushton's office;
in this door was a small sliding panel or trap-door with a little shelf
at the bottom.The men stood in the road on the pavement outside the
closed door, their money being passed out to them through the sliding
panel.As there was no shelter, when it rained they occasionally got
wet through while waiting to be paid.With some firms it is customary
to call out the names of the men and pay them in order of seniority or
ability, but there was no such system here; the man who got to the
aperture first was paid first, and so on.The result was that there
was always a sort of miniature 'Battle of Life', the men pushing and
struggling against each other as if their lives depended upon their
being paid by a certain time.On the ledge of the little window through which their money was passed
there was always a Hospital collection-box.Every man put either a
penny or twopence into this box.Of course, it was not compulsory to
do so, but they all did, because they felt that any man who omitted to
contribute might be'marked'.They did not all agree with contributing
to the Hospital, for several reasons.They knew that the doctors at
the Hospital made a practice of using the free patients to make
experiments upon, and they also knew that the so-called 'free' patients
who contribute so very largely directly to the maintenance of such
institutions, get scant consideration when they apply for the 'free'
treatment, and are plainly given to understand that they are receiving
'charity'.Some of the men thought that, considering the extent to
which they contributed, they should be entitled to attention as a right.After receiving their wages, Crass, Easton, Bundy, Philpot, Harlow and
a few others adjourned to the Cricketers for a drink.Owen went away
alone, and Slyme also went on by himself.There was no use waiting for
Easton to come out of the public house, because there was no knowing
how long he would be; he might stay half an hour or two hours.On his way home, in accordance with his usual custom, Slyme called at
the Post Office to put some of his wages in the bank.Like most other
'Christians', he believed in taking thought for the morrow, what he
should eat and drink and wherewithal he was to be clothed.He thought
it wise to layup for himself as much treasure upon earth as possible.The fact that Jesus said that His disciples were not to do these things
made no more difference to Slyme's conduct than it does to the conduct
of any other 'Christian'.They are all agreed that when Jesus said
this He meant something else: and all the other inconvenient things
that Jesus said are disposed of in the same way.For instance, these
'disciples' assure us that when Jesus said, 'Resist not evil', 'If a
man smite thee upon he right cheek turn unto him also the left', He
really meant 'Turn on to him a Maxim gun; disembowel him with a bayonet
or batter in his skull with the butt end of a rifle!'When He said,
'If one take thy coat, give him thy cloak also,' the 'Christians' say
that what He really meant was: 'If one take thy coat, give him six
months' hard labour.A few of the followers of Jesus admit that He
really did mean just what He said, but they say that the world would
never be able to go on if they followed out His teachings!It is probably the effect that Jesus intended His teachings to
produce.It is altogether improbable that He wished the world to
continue along its present lines.But, if these pretended followers
really think--as they say that they do--that the teachings of Jesus are
ridiculous and impracticable, why continue the hypocritical farce of
calling themselves 'Christians' when they don't really believe in or
follow Him at all?As Jesus himself pointed out, there's no sense in calling Him 'Lord,
Lord' when they do not the things that He said.This banking transaction finished, Slyme resumed his homeward way,
stopping only to purchase some sweets at a confectioner's.He spent a
whole sixpence at once in this shop on a glass jar of sweets for the
baby.Ruth was not surprised when she saw him come in alone; it was the usual
thing since Easton had become so friendly with Crass.She made no reference to his absence, but Slyme noticed with secret
chagrin that she was annoyed and disappointed.She was just finishing
scrubbing the kitchen floor and little Freddie was sitting up in a
baby's high chair that had a little shelf or table fixed in front of
it.To keep him amused while she did her work, Ruth had given him a
piece of bread and raspberry jam, which the child had rubbed all over
his face and into his scalp, evidently being under the impression that
it was something for the improvement of the complexion, or a cure for
baldness.He now looked as if he had been in a fight or a railway
accident.The child hailed the arrival of Slyme with enthusiasm, being
so overcome with emotion that he began to shed tears, and was only
pacified when the man gave him the jar of sweets and took him out of
the chair.Slyme's presence in the house had not proved so irksome as Easton and
Ruth had dreaded it would be.Indeed, at first, he made a point of
retiring to his own room after tea every evening, until they invited
him to stay downstairs in the kitchen.Nearly every Wednesday and
Saturday he went to a meeting, or an open-air preaching, when the
weather permitted, for he was one of a little zealous band of people
connected with the Shining Light Chapel who carried on the 'open-air'
work all the year round.After a while, the Eastons not only became
reconciled to his presence in the house, but were even glad of it.Ruth
especially would often have been very lonely if he had not been there,
for it had lately become Easton's custom to spend a few evenings every
week with Crass at the Cricketers.When at home Slyme passed his time playing a mandolin or making
fretwork photo frames.Ruth had the baby's photograph taken a few
weeks after Slyme came, and the frame he made for it was now one of the
ornaments of the sitting-room.The instinctive, unreasoning aversion
she had at first felt for him had passed away.In a quiet, unobtrusive
manner he did her so many little services that she found it impossible
to dislike him.At first, she used to address him as 'Mr' but after a
time she fell naturally into Easton's practice of calling him by his
first name.As for the baby, he made no secret of his affection for the lodger, who
nursed and played with him for hours at a stretch.'I'll serve your dinner now, Alf,' said Ruth when she had finished
scrubbing the floor, 'but I'll wait for mine for a little while.'I'm in no hurry,' replied Slyme.'I'll go and have a wash; he may be
here then.'As he spoke, Slyme--who had been sitting by the fire nursing the
baby--who was trying to swallow the jar of sweets--put the child back
into the high chair, giving him one of the sticks of sweet out of the
jar to keep him quiet; and went upstairs to his own room.He came down
again in about a quarter of an hour, and Ruth proceeded to serve his
dinner, for Easton was still absent.'If I was you, I wouldn't wait for Will,' said Slyme, 'he may not come
for another hour or two.It's after two o'clock now, and I'm sure you
must be hungry.''I suppose I may as well,' replied Ruth, hesitatingly.'He'll most
likely get some bread and cheese at the "Cricketers", same as he did
last Saturday.'The baby had had his face washed while Slyme was upstairs.Directly he
saw his mother eating he threw away the sugar-stick and began to cry,
holding out his arms to her.She had to take him on her lap whilst she
ate her dinner, and feed him with pieces from her plate.Slyme talked all the time, principally about the child.He was very
fond of children, he said, and always got on well with them, but he had
really never known such an intelligent child--for his age--as Freddie.His fellow-workmen would have been astonished had they been present to
hear him talking about the shape of the baby's head.They would have
been astonished at the amount of knowledge he appeared to possess of
the science of Phrenology.Ruth, at any rate, thought he was very
clever.After a time the child began to grow fretful and refused to eat; when
his mother gave him a fresh piece of sugar-stick out of the jar he
threw it peevishly on the floor and began to whimper, rubbing his face
against his mother's bosom and pulling at her dress with his hands.When Slyme first came Ruth had made a practice of withdrawing from the
room if he happened to be present when she wanted to nurse the child,
but lately she had been less sensitive.She was sitting with her back
to the window and she partly covered the baby's face with a light shawl
that she wore.By the time they finished dinner the child had dozed
off to sleep.Slyme got up from his chair and stood with his back to
the fire, looking down at them; presently he spoke, referring, of
course, to the baby:

'He's very like you, isn't he?'Slyme moved a little closer, bending down to look at the slumbering
infant.'You know, at first I thought he was a girl,' he continued after a
pause.'He seems almost too pretty for a boy, doesn't he?''People always take him for a girl at first,' she said.'Yesterday I took him with me to the Monopole Stores to buy some
things, and the manager would hardly believe it wasn't a girl.'The man reached out his hand and stroked the baby's face.Although Slyme's behaviour had hitherto always been very correct, yet
there was occasionally an indefinable something in his manner when they
were alone that made Ruth feel conscious and embarrassed.Now, as she
glanced up at him and saw the expression on his face she crimsoned with
confusion and hastily lowered her eyes without replying to his last
remark.He did not speak again either, and they remained for several
minutes in silence, as if spellbound, Ruth oppressed with instinctive
dread, and Slyme scarcely less agitated, his face flushed and his heart
beating wildly.He trembled as he stood over her, hesitating and afraid.And then the silence was suddenly broken by the creaking and clanging
of the front gate, heralding the tardy coming of Easton.Slyme went
out into the scullery and, taking down the blacking brushes from the
shelf, began cleaning his boots.It was plain from Easton's appearance and manner that he had been
drinking, but Ruth did not reproach him in any way; on the contrary,
she seemed almost feverishly anxious to attend to his comfort.When Slyme finished cleaning his boots he went upstairs to his room,
receiving a careless greeting from Easton as he passed through the
kitchen.He felt nervous and apprehensive that Ruth might say
something to Easton, and was not quite able to reassure himself with
the reflection that, after all, there was nothing to tell.As for
Ruth, she had to postpone the execution of her hastily formed
resolution to tell her husband of Slyme's strange behaviour, for Easton
fell asleep in his chair before he had finished his dinner, and she had
some difficulty in waking him sufficiently to persuade him to go
upstairs to bed, where he remained until tea-time.Probably he would
not have come down even then if it had not been for the fact that he
had made an appointment to meet Crass at the Cricketers.Whilst Easton was asleep, Slyme had been downstairs in the kitchen,
making a fretwork frame.He played with Freddie while Ruth prepared
the tea, and he appeared to her to be so unconscious of having done
anything unusual that she began to think that she must have been
mistaken in imagining that he had intended anything wrong.After tea, Slyme put on his best clothes to go to his usual 'open-air'
meeting.As a rule Easton and Ruth went out marketing together every
Saturday night, but this evening he could not wait for her because he
had promised to meet Crass at seven o'clock; so he arranged to see her
down town at eight.Chapter 23

The 'Open-air'


During the last few weeks ever since he had been engaged on the
decoration of the drawing-room, Owen had been so absorbed in his work
that he had no time for other things.Of course, all he was paid for
was the time he actually worked, but really every waking moment of his
time was given to the task.Now that it was finished he felt something
like one aroused from a dream to the stern realities and terrors of
life.By the end of next week, the inside of the house and part of the
outside would be finished, and as far as he knew the firm had nothing
else to do at present.Most of the other employers in the town were in
the same plight, and it would be of no use to apply even to such of
them as had something to do, for they were not likely to take on a
fresh man while some of their regular hands were idle.For the last month he had forgotten that he was ill; he had forgotten
that when the work at 'The Cave' was finished he would have to stand
off with the rest of the hands.In brief, he had forgotten for the
time being that, like the majority of his fellow workmen, he was on the
brink of destitution, and that a few weeks of unemployment or idleness
meant starvation.As far as illness was concerned, he was even worse
off than most others, for the greater number of them were members of
some sick benefit club, but Owen's ill-health rendered him ineligible
for membership of such societies.As he walked homewards after being paid, feeling unutterably depressed
and weary, he began once more to think of the future; and the more he
thought of it the more dreadful it appeared.Even looking at it in the
best possible light--supposing he did not fall too ill to work, or lose
his employment from some other cause--what was there to live for?These few coins that he held in his
hand were the result, and he laughed bitterly as he thought of all they
had to try to do with this money, and of all that would have to be left
undone.As he turned the corner of Kerk Street he saw Frankie coming to meet
him, and the boy catching sight of him at the same moment began running
and leapt into his arms with a joyous whoop.'Mother told me to tell you to buy something for dinner before you come
home, because there's nothing in the house.''Did she tell you what I was to get?'She did tell me something, but I forget what it was.But I know she
said to get anything you like if you couldn't get what she told me to
tell you.''Well, we'll go and see what we can find,' said Owen.'If I were you, I'd get a tin of salmon or some eggs and bacon,'
suggested Frankie as he skipped along holding his father's hand.'We
don't want anything that's a lot of trouble to cook, you know, because
Mum's not very well today.'She's been up all the morning, but she's lying down now.We've done
all the work, though.While she was making the beds I started washing
up the cups and saucers without telling her, but when she came in and
saw what a mess I'd made on the floor, she had to stop me doing it, and
she had to change nearly all my clothes as well, because I was almost
wet through; but I managed the wiping up all right when she did the
washing, and I swept the passage and put all my things tidy and made
the cat's bed.And that just reminds me: will you please give me my
penny now?I promised the cat that I'd bring him back some meat.'Owen complied with the boy's request, and while the latter went to the
butcher's for the meat, Owen went into the grocer's to get something
for dinner, it being arranged that they were to meet again at the
corner of the street.Owen was at the appointed place first and after
waiting some time and seeing no sign of the boy he decided to go
towards the butcher's to meet him.When he came in sight of the shop
he saw the boy standing outside in earnest conversation with the
butcher, a jolly-looking stoutly built man, with a very red face.Owen
perceived at once that the child was trying to explain something,
because Frankie had a habit of holding his head sideways and
supplementing his speech by spreading out his fingers and making quaint
gestures with his hands whenever he found it difficult to make himself
understood.The boy was doing this now, waving one hand about with the
fingers and thumb extended wide, and with the other flourishing a paper
parcel which evidently contained the pieces of meat.Presently the man
laughed heartily and after shaking hands with Frankie went into the
shop to attend to a customer, and Frankie rejoined his father.'That butcher's a very decent sort of chap, you know, Dad,' he said.'He wouldn't take a penny for the meat.''Is that what you were talking to him about?'You see, this is the second time
he wouldn't take the money, and the first time he did it I thought he
must be a Socialist, but I didn't ask him then.But when he did it
again this time I asked him if he was.He said he
wasn't quite mad yet.So I said, "If you think that Socialists are all
mad, you're very much mistaken, because I'm a Socialist myself, and I'm
quite sure I'M not mad."So he said he knew I was all right, but he
didn't understand anything about Socialism himself--only that it meant
sharing out all the money so that everyone could have the same.So
then I told him that's not Socialism at all!And when I explained it
to him properly and advised him to be one, he said he'd think about it.So I said if he'd only do that he'd be sure to change over to our side;
and then he laughed and promised to let me know next time he sees me,
and I promised to lend him some literature.You won't mind, will you,
Dad?''Of course not; when we get home we'll have a look through what we've
got and you can take him some of them.'He knew that these were 'two of the best' because he had often heard
his father and mother say so, and he had noticed that whenever a
Socialist friend came to visit them, he was also of the same opinion.As a rule on Saturday evenings they all three went out together to do
the marketing, but on this occasion, in consequence of Nora being
unwell, Owen and Frankie went by themselves.The frequent recurrence
of his wife's illness served to increase Owen's pessimism with regard
to the future, and the fact that he was unable to procure for her the
comforts she needed was not calculated to dispel the depression that
filled his mind as he reflected that there was no hope of better times.In the majority of cases, for a workman there is no hope of
advancement.After he has learnt his trade and become a 'journeyman'
all progress ceases.After he has been working ten
or twenty years he commands no more than he did at first--a bare living
wage--sufficient money to purchase fuel to keep the human machine
working.As he grows older he will have to be content with even less;
and all the time he holds his employment at the caprice and by the
favour of his masters, who regard him merely as a piece of mechanism
that enables them to accumulate money--a thing which they are justified
in casting aside as soon as it becomes unprofitable.And the workman
must not only be an efficient money-producing machine, but he must also
be the servile subject of his masters.If he is not abjectly civil and
humble, if he will not submit tamely to insult, indignity, and every
form of contemptuous treatment that occasion makes possible, he can be
dismissed, and replaced in a moment by one of the crowd of unemployed
who are always waiting for his job.This is the status of the majority
of the 'Heirs of all the ages' under the present system.As he walked through the crowded streets holding Frankie by the hand,
Owen thought that to voluntarily continue to live such a life as this
betokened a degraded mind.To allow one's child to grow up to suffer
it in turn was an act of callous, criminal cruelty.In this matter he held different opinions from most of his fellow
workmen.The greater number of them were quite willing and content
that their children should be made into beasts of burden for the
benefit of other people.As he looked down upon the little, frail
figure trotting along by his side, Owen thought for the thousandth time
that it would be far better for the child to die now: he would never be
fit to be a soldier in the ferocious Christian Battle of Life.Although she was always brave, and never
complained, he knew that her life was one of almost incessant physical
suffering; and as for himself he was tired and sick of it all.He had
been working like a slave all his life and there was nothing to show
for it--there never would be anything to show for it.He thought of
the man who had killed his wife and children.The jury had returned
the usual verdict, 'Temporary Insanity'.It never seemed to occur to
these people that the truth was that to continue to suffer hopelessly
like this was evidence of permanent insanity.But supposing that bodily death was not the end.Suppose there was
some kind of a God?If there were, it wasn't unreasonable to think
that the Being who was capable of creating such a world as this and who
seemed so callously indifferent to the unhappiness of His creatures,
would also be capable of devising and creating the other Hell that most
people believed in.Although it was December the evening was mild and clear.The full moon
deluged the town with silvery light, and the cloudless sky was jewelled
with myriads of glittering stars.Looking out into the unfathomable infinity of space, Owen wondered what
manner of Being or Power it was that had originated and sustained all
this?Considered as an explanation of the existence of the universe,
the orthodox Christian religion was too absurd to merit a second
thought.But then, every other conceivable hypothesis was
also--ultimately--unsatisfactory and even ridiculous.To believe that
the universe as it is now has existed from all eternity without any
Cause is surely ridiculous.But to say that it was created by a Being
who existed without a Cause from all eternity is equally ridiculous.In fact, it was only postponing the difficulty one stage.Evolution
was not more satisfactory, because although it was undoubtedly true as
far as it went, it only went part of the way, leaving the great
question still unanswered by assuming the existence--in the
beginning--of the elements of matter, without a cause!The question
remained unanswered because it was unanswerable.Regarding this
problem man was but--

        'An infant crying in the night,
        An infant crying for the light
        And with no language but a cry.'All the same, it did not follow, because one could not explain the
mystery oneself, that it was right to try to believe an unreasonable
explanation offered by someone else.But although he reasoned like this, Owen could not help longing for
something to believe, for some hope for the future; something to
compensate for the unhappiness of the present.In one sense, he
thought, how good it would be if Christianity were true, and after all
the sorrow there was to be an eternity of happiness such as it had
never entered into the heart of man to conceive?If only that were
true, nothing else would matter.How contemptible and insignificant the
very worst that could happen here would be if one knew that this life
was only a short journey that was to terminate at the beginning of an
eternity of joy?But no one really believed this; and as for those who
pretended to do so--their lives showed that they did not believe it at
all.Their greed and inhumanity--their ferocious determination to
secure for themselves the good things of THIS world--were conclusive
proofs of their hypocrisy and infidelity.'Dad,' said Frankie, suddenly, 'let's go over and hear what that man's
saying.'He pointed across the way to where--a little distance back
from the main road, just round the corner of a side street--a group of
people were standing encircling a large lantern fixed on the top of a
pole about seven feet high, which was being held by one of the men.A
bright light was burning inside this lantern and on the pane of white,
obscured glass which formed the sides, visible from where Owen and
Frankie were standing, was written in bold plain letters that were
readable even at that distance, the text:

        'Be not deceived: God is not mocked!'The man whose voice had attracted Frankie's attention was reading out a
verse of a hymn:

        'I heard the voice of Jesus say,
        Behold, I freely give,
        The living water, thirsty one,
        Stoop down and drink, and live.I came to Jesus and I drank
        Of that life giving stream,
        My thirst was quenched,
        My soul revived,
        And now I live in Him.'The individual who gave out this hymn was a tall, thin man whose
clothes hung loosely on the angles of his round-shouldered, bony form.His long, thin legs--about which the baggy trousers hung in ungraceful
folds--were slightly knock-kneed, and terminated in large, flat feet.His arms were very long even for such a tall man, and the huge, bony
hands were gnarled and knotted.Regardless of the season, he had
removed his bowler hat, revealing his forehead, which was high, flat
and narrow.His nose was a large, fleshy, hawklike beak, and from the
side of each nostril a deep indentation extended downwards until it
disappeared in the drooping moustache that concealed his mouth when he
was not speaking, but the vast extent of which was perceptible now as
he opened it to call out the words of the hymn.His chin was large and
extraordinarily long: the eyes were pale blue, very small and close
together, surmounted by spare, light-, almost invisible
eyebrows with a deep vertical cleft between them over the nose.His
head--covered with thick, coarse brown hair--was very large, especially
at the back; the ears were small and laid close to the head.If one
were to make a full-face drawing of his cadaverous visage, it would be
found that the outline resembled that of the lid of a coffin.As Owen and Frankie drew near, the boy tugged at his father's hand and
whispered: 'Dad!that's the teacher at the Sunday School where I went
that day with Charley and Elsie.'Owen looked quickly and saw that it was Hunter.As Hunter ceased reading out the words of the hymn, the little company
of evangelists began to sing, accompanied by the strains of a small but
peculiarly sweet-toned organ.A few persons in the crowd joined in,
the words being familiar to them.During the singing their faces were
a study, they all looked so profoundly solemn and miserable, as if they
were a gang of condemned criminals waiting to be led forth to
execution.The great number of the people standing around appeared to
be listening more out of idle curiosity than anything else, and two
well-dressed young men--evidently strangers and visitors to the
town--amused themselves by making audible remarks about the texts on
the lantern.There was also a shabbily dressed, semi-drunken man in a
battered bowler hat who stood on the inner edge of the crowd, almost in
the ring itself, with folded arms and an expression of scorn.He had a
very thin, pale face with a large, high-bridged nose, and bore a
striking resemblance to the First Duke of Wellington.As the singing proceeded, the scornful expression faded from the visage
of the Semi-drunk, and he not only joined in, but unfolded his arms and
began waving them about as if he were conducting the music.By the time the singing was over a considerable crowd had gathered, and
then one of the evangelists, the same man who had given out the hymn,
stepped into the middle of the ring.He had evidently been offended by
the unseemly conduct of the two well-dressed young men, for after a
preliminary glance round upon the crowd, he fixed his gaze upon the
pair, and immediately launched out upon a long tirade against what he
called 'Infidelity'.Then, having heartily denounced all those who--as
he put it--'refused' to believe, he proceeded to ridicule those
half-and-half believers, who, while professing to believe the Bible,
rejected the doctrine of Hell.That the existence of a place of
eternal torture is taught in the Bible, he tried to prove by a long
succession of texts.As he proceeded he became very excited, and the
contemptuous laughter of the two unbelievers seemed to make him worse.He shouted and raved, literally foaming at the mouth and glaring in a
frenzied manner around upon the faces of the crowd.'And understand this clearly--"The
wicked shall be turned into hell"--"He that believeth not shall be
damned."''Well, then, you'll stand a very good chance of being damned also,'
exclaimed one of the two young men.demanded the preacher, wiping the froth from
his lips and the perspiration from his forehead with his handkerchief.'Why, because you don't believe the Bible yourselves.'Nimrod and the other evangelists laughed, and looked pityingly at the
young man.'Ah, my dear brother,' said Misery.I thank
God I do believe it, every word!''Amen,' fervently ejaculated Slyme and several of the other disciples.'Oh no, you don't,' replied the other.'Prove it, then,' said Nimrod.'Read out the 17th and 18th verses of the XVIth chapter of Mark,' said
the disturber of the meeting.The crowd began to close in on the
centre, the better to hear the dispute.Misery, standing close to the
lantern, found the verse mentioned and read aloud as follows:

'And these signs shall follow them that believe.In my name shall they
cast out devils: they shall speak with new tongues.They shall take up
serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them:
they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.''Well, you can't heal the sick, neither can you speak new languages or
cast out devils: but perhaps you can drink deadly things without
suffering harm.'The speaker here suddenly drew from his waistcoat
pocket a small glass bottle and held it out towards Misery, who shrank
from it with horror as he continued: 'I have here a most deadly poison.There is in this bottle sufficient strychnine to kill a dozen
unbelievers.And if it doesn't harm you, we'll know that
you really are a believer and that what you believe is the truth!'said the Semi-drunk, who had listened to the progress of
the argument with great interest.Some of the people in the crowd began to laugh, and voices were heard
from several quarters calling upon Misery to drink the strychnine.'Now, if you'll allow me, I'll explain to you what that there verse
means,' said Hunter.'If you read it carefully--WITH the context--'

'I don't want you to tell me what it means,' interrupted the other.'I
am able to read for myself.Whatever you may say, or pretend to think
it means, I know what it says.''Hear, Hear,' shouted several voices, and angry cries of 'Why don't you
drink the poison?'began to be heard from the outskirts of the crowd.'Are you going to drink it or not?'retorted Misery, fiercely, and a loud shout
of laughter broke from the crowd.''P'haps some of the other "believers" would like to,' said the young
man sneeringly, looking round upon the disciples.As no one seemed
desirous of availing himself of this offer, the man returned the bottle
regretfully to his pocket.'I suppose,' said Misery, regarding the owner of the strychnine with a
sneer, 'I suppose you're one of them there hired critics wot's goin'
about the country doin' the Devil's work?''Wot I wants to know is this 'ere,' said the Semi-drunk, suddenly
advancing into the middle of the ring and speaking in a loud voice.'Where did Cain get 'is wife from?''Don't answer 'im, Brother 'Unter,' said Mr Didlum, one of the
disciples.This was rather an unnecessary piece of advice, because
Misery did not know the answer.An individual in a long black garment--the'minister'--now whispered
something to Miss Didlum, who was seated at the organ, whereupon she
began to play, and the 'believers' began to sing, as loud as they could
so as to drown the voices of the disturbers of the meeting, a song
called 'Oh, that will be Glory for me!'After this hymn the'minister' invited a shabbily dressed 'brother'--a
working-man member of the PSA, to say a 'few words', and the latter
accordingly stepped into the centre of the ring and held forth as
follows:

'My dear frens, I thank Gord tonight that I can stand 'ere tonight,
hout in the hopen hair and tell hall you dear people tonight of hall
wot's been done for ME.Ho my dear frens hi ham so glad tonight as I
can stand 'ere tonight and say as hall my sins is hunder the blood
tonight and wot 'E's done for me 'E can do for you tonight.If you'll
honly do as I done and just acknowledge yourself a lost sinner--'

'Yes!'Amen,' cried all the other believers.

'--If you'll honly come to 'im tonight in the same way as I done you'll
see wot 'E's done for me 'E can do for you.Ho my dear frens, don't go
puttin' it orf from day to day like a door turnin' on its 'inges, don't
put orf to some more convenient time because you may never 'ave another
chance.'Im that bein' orfen reproved 'ardeneth 'is neck shall be
suddenly cut orf and that without remedy.Ho come to 'im tonight, for
'Is name's sake and to 'Im we'll give hall the glory.'Amen,' said the believers, fervently, and then the man who was dressed
in the long garment entreated all those who were not yet true
believers--and doers--of the word to join earnestly and MEANINGLY in
the singing of the closing hymn, which he was about to read out to them.The Semi-drunk obligingly conducted as before, and the crowd faded away
with the last notes of the music.Chapter 24

Ruth


As has already been stated, hitherto Slyme had passed the greater
number of his evenings at home, but during the following three weeks a
change took place in his habits in this respect.He now went out
nearly every night and did not return until after ten o'clock.On
meeting nights he always changed his attire, dressing himself as on
Sundays, but on the other occasions he went out in his week-day
clothes.Ruth often wondered where he went on those nights, but he
never volunteered the information and she never asked him.Easton had chummed up with a lot of the regular customers at the
'Cricketers', where he now spent most of his spare time, drinking beer,
telling yarns or playing shove-ha'penny or hooks and rings.When he had
no cash the Old Dear gave him credit until Saturday.At first, the
place had not had much attraction for him, and he really went there
only for the purpose of 'keeping in' with Crass: but after a time he
found it a very congenial way of passing his evenings...

One evening, Ruth saw Slyme meet Crass as if by appointment and as the
two men went away together she returned to her housework wondering what
it meant.Meantime, Crass and Slyme proceeded on their way down town.It was
about half past six o'clock: the shops and streets were brilliantly
lighted, and as they went along they saw numerous groups of men talking
together in a listless way.Most of them were artisans and labourers
out of employment and evidently in no great hurry to go home.Some of
them had neither tea nor fire to go to, and stayed away from home as
long as possible so as not to be compelled to look upon the misery of
those who were waiting for them there.Others hung about hoping
against all probability that they might even yet--although it was so
late--hear of some job to be started somewhere or other.As they passed one of these groups they recognized and nodded to Newman
and old Jack Linden, and the former left the others and came up to
Crass and Slyme, who did not pause, so Newman walked along with them.'No; we ain't got 'ardly anything,' replied Crass.'I reckon we shall
finish up at "The Cave" next week, and then I suppose we shall all be
stood orf.We've got several plumbers on, and I believe there's a
little gas-fitting work in, but next to nothing in our line.''I suppose you don't know of any other firm what's got anything?'Between you and me, I don't think any of 'em has;
they're all in about the same fix.''I've not done anything since I left, you know,' said Newman, 'and
we've just about got as far as we can get, at home.'Slyme and Crass said nothing in reply to this.They wished that Newman
would take himself off, because they did not want him to know where
they were going.However, Newman continued to accompany them and an awkward silence
succeeded.He seemed to wish to say something more, and they both
guessed what it was.So they walked along as rapidly as possible in
order not to give him any encouragement.At last Newman blurted out:

'I suppose--you don't happen--either of you--to have a tanner you could
lend me?I'll let you have it back--when I get a job.''I ain't mate,' replied Crass.'I'm sorry; if I 'ad one on me, you
should 'ave it, with pleasure.'Slyme also expressed his regret that he had no money with him, and at
the corner of the next street Newman--ashamed of having asked--wished
them 'good night' and went away.Slyme and Crass hurried along and presently arrived at Rushton & Co.The windows were lit up with electric light, displaying an
assortment of wallpapers, gas and electric light fittings, glass
shades, globes, tins of enamel, paint and varnish.Several framed
show-cards--'Estimates Free', 'First class work only, at moderate
charges', 'Only First Class Workmen Employed' and several others of the
same type.On one side wall of the window was a large shield-shaped
board covered with black velvet on which a number of brass fittings for
coffins were arranged.The shield was on an oak mount with the
inscription: 'Funerals conducted on modern principles'.Slyme waited outside while Crass went in.Mr Budd, the shopman, was
down at the far end near the glazed partition which separated Mr
Rushton's office from the front shop.As Crass entered, Budd--who was
a pale-faced, unhealthy-looking, undersized youth about twenty years of
age--looked round and, with a grimace, motioned him to walk softly.Crass paused, wondering what the other meant; but the shopman beckoned
him to advance, grinning and winking and jerking his thumb over his
shoulder in the direction of the office.Crass hesitated, fearing that
possibly the miserable Budd had gone--or been driven--out of his mind;
but as the latter continued to beckon and grin and point towards the
office Crass screwed up his courage and followed him behind one of the
showcases, and applying his eye to a crack in the woodwork of the
partition indicated by Budd, he could see Mr Rushton in the act of
kissing and embracing Miss Wade, the young lady clerk.Crass watched
them for some time and then whispered to Budd to call Slyme, and when
the latter came they all three took turns at peeping through the crack
in the partition.When they had looked their fill they came out from behind the showcase,
almost bursting with suppressed merriment.Budd reached down a key
from where it was hanging on a hook on the wall and gave it to Crass
and the two resumed their interrupted journey.But before they had
proceeded a dozen yards from the shop, they were accosted by a short,
elderly man with grey hair and a beard.This man looked about
sixty-five years of age, and was very shabbily dressed.The ends of
the sleeves of his coat were frayed and ragged, and the elbows were
worn threadbare.His boots were patched, broken, and down at heel, and
the knees and bottoms of the legs of his trousers were in the same
condition as the sleeves of his coat.This man's name was Latham; he
was a venetian blind maker and repairer.With his son, he was supposed
to be 'in business' on his own account, but as most of their work was
done for 'the trade', that is, for such firms as Rushton & Co., they
would be more correctly described as men who did piecework at home.He had been 'in business'--as he called it--for about forty years
working, working, always working; and ever since his son became old
enough to labour he had helped his father in the philanthropic task of
manufacturing profits for the sweaters who employed them.They had
been so busy running after work, and working for the benefit of others,
that they had overlooked the fact that they were only earning a bare
living for themselves and now, after forty years' hard labour, the old
man was clothed in rags and on the verge of destitution.'Yes, I think so,' replied Crass, attempting to pass on; but the old
man detained him.'He promised to let us know about them blinds for "The Cave".We gave
'im a price for 'em about a month ago.In fact, we gave 'im two
prices, because he said the first was too high.Five and six a set I
asked 'im!take 'em right through the 'ole 'ouse!Two coats of paint, and new tapes and cords.'No,' said Crass, walking on; 'that was cheap enough!'HE said it was too much,' continued Latham.'Said as 'e could get 'em
done cheaper!But I say as no one can't do it and make a living.'As he walked along, talking, between Crass and Slyme, the old man
became very excited.'But we 'adn't nothing to do to speak of, so my son told 'im we'd do
'em for five bob a set, and 'e said 'e'd let us know, but we ain't
'eard nothing from 'im yet, so I thought I'd try and see 'im tonight.'Well, you'll find 'im in there now,' said Slyme with a peculiar look,
and walking faster.'I won't take 'em on for no less!'cried the old man as he turned back.I've got my livin' to get, and my son's got 'is wife and little 'uns to
keep.'Certainly not,' said Crass, glad to get away at last.'Good night,
and good luck to you.'As soon as they were out of hearing, they both burst out laughing at
the old man's vehemence.'Seemed quite upset about it,' said Slyme; and they laughed again.They now left the main road and pursued their way through a number of
badly lighted, mean-looking streets, and finally turning down a kind of
alley, arrived at their destination.On one side of this street was a
row of small houses; facing these were a number of buildings of a
miscellaneous description--sheds and stables; and beyond these a plot
of waste ground on which could be seen, looming weirdly through the
dusk, a number of empty carts and waggons with their shafts resting on
the ground or reared up into the air.Threading their way carefully
through these and avoiding as much as possible the mud, pools of water,
and rubbish which covered the ground, they arrived at a large gate
fastened with a padlock.Applying the key, Crass swung back the gate
and they found themselves in a large yard filled with building
materials and plant, ladders, huge tressels, planks and beams of wood,
hand-carts, and wheelbarrows, heaps of sand and mortar and innumerable
other things that assumed strange fantastic shapes in the
semi-darkness.Crates and packing cases, lengths of iron guttering and
rain-pipes, old door-frames and other woodwork that had been taken from
buildings where alterations had been made.And over all these things,
a gloomy, indistinct and shapeless mass, rose the buildings and sheds
that comprised Rushton & Co.Crass struck a match, and Slyme, stooping down, drew a key from a
crevice in the wall near one of the doors, which he unlocked, and they
entered.Crass struck another match and lit the gas at the jointed
bracket fixed to the wall.At one end was a
fireplace without a grate but with an iron bar fixed across the
blackened chimney for the purpose of suspending pails or pots over the
fire, which was usually made of wood on the hearthstone.All round the
walls of the shop--which had once been whitewashed, but were now
covered with smears of paint of every colour where the men had 'rubbed
out' their brushes--were rows of shelves with kegs of paint upon them.In front of the window was a long bench covered with an untidy litter
of dirty paint-pots, including several earthenware mixing vessels or
mortars, the sides of these being thickly coated with dried paint.Scattered about the stone floor were a number of dirty pails, either
empty or containing stale whitewash; and standing on a sort of low
platform or shelf at one end of the shop were four large round tanks
fitted with taps and labelled 'Boiled Oil', 'Turps', 'Linseed Oil',
'Turps Substitute'.The lower parts of the walls were discoloured with
moisture.The atmosphere was cold and damp and foul with the sickening
odours of the poisonous materials.It was in this place that Bert--the apprentice--spent most of his time,
cleaning out pots and pails, during slack periods when there were no
jobs going on outside.In the middle of the shop, under a two-armed gas pendant, was another
table or bench, also thickly coated with old, dried paint, and by the
side of this were two large stands on which were hanging up to dry some
of the lathes of the venetian blinds belonging to 'The Cave', which
Crass and Slyme were painting--piecework--in their spare time.The
remainder of the lathes were leaning against the walls or piled in
stacks on the table.Crass shivered with cold as he lit the two gas-jets.'Make a bit of a
fire, Alf, he said, 'while I gets the colour ready.'Slyme went outside and presently returned with his arms full of old
wood, which he smashed up and threw into the fireplace; then he took an
empty paint-pot and filled it with turpentine from the big tank and
emptied it over the wood.Amongst the pots on the mixing bench he
found one full of old paint, and he threw this over the wood also, and
in a few minutes he had made a roaring fire.Meantime, Crass had prepared the paint and brushes and taken down the
lathes from the drying frames.The two men now proceeded with the
painting of the blinds, working rapidly, each lathe being hung on the
wires of the drying frame after being painted.They talked freely as
they worked, having no fear of being overheard by Rushton or Nimrod.This job was piecework, so it didn't matter whether they talked or not.They waxed hilarious over Old Latham's discomfiture and wondered what
he would say if he could see them now.Then the conversation drifted
to the subject of the private characters of the other men who were
employed by Rushton & Co., and an impartial listener--had there been
one there--would have been forced to come to the same conclusion as
Crass and Slyme did: namely, that they themselves were the only two
decent fellows on the firm.There was something wrong or shady about
everybody else.That bloke Barrington, for instance--it was a very
funny business, you know, for a chap like 'im to be workin' as a
labourer, it looked very suspicious.Nobody knowed exactly who 'e was
or where 'e come from, but anyone could tell 'e'd been a toff.It was
very certain 'e'd never bin brought up to work for 'is livin'.The
most probable explanation was that 'e'd committed some crime and bin
disowned by 'is family--pinched some money, or forged a cheque or
something like that.It was a well-known fact that he used to go round to
Misery's house nearly every night to tell him every little thing that
had happened on the job during the day!As for Payne, the foreman
carpenter, the man was a perfect fool: he'd find out the difference if
ever he got the sack from Rushton's and went to work for some other
firm!He didn't understand his trade, and he couldn't make a coffin
properly to save 'is life!Then there was that rotter Owen; there was
a bright specimen for yer!didn't believe in no God or
Devil or nothing else.A pretty state of things there would be if
these Socialists could have their own way: for one thing, nobody would
be allowed to work overtime!Crass and Slyme worked and talked in this manner till ten o'clock, and
then they extinguished the fire by throwing some water on it--put out
the gas and locked up the shop and the yard, dropping the key of the
latter into the letter-box at Rushton's office on their way home.In this way they worked at the blinds nearly every night for three
weeks.When Saturday arrived the men working at 'The Cave' were again
surprised that nobody was sacked, and they were divided in opinion as
to the reason, some thinking that Nimrod was determined to keep them
all on till the job was finished, so as to get it done as quickly as
possible; and others boldly asserting the truth of a rumour that had
been going about for several days that the firm had another big job in.Mr Sweater had bought another house; Rushton had to do it up, and they
were all to be kept on to start this other work as soon as 'The Cave'
was finished.Crass knew no more than anyone else and he maintained a
discreet silence, but the fact that he did not contradict the rumour
served to strengthen it.The only foundation that existed for this
report was that Rushton and Misery had been seen looking over the
garden gate of a large empty house near 'The Cave'.But although it
had such an insignificant beginning, the rumour had grown and increased
in detail and importance day by day.That very morning at
breakfast-time, the man on the pail had announced that he had heard on
the very best authority that Mr Sweater had sold all his interest in
the great business that bore his name and was about to retire into
private life, and that he intended to buy up all the house property in
the neighbourhood of 'The Cave'.Another individual--one of the new
hands--said that he had heard someone else--in a public house--say that
Rushton was about to marry one of Sweater's daughters, and that Sweater
intended to give the couple a house to live in, as a wedding present:
but the fact that Rushton was already married and the father of four
children, rather knocked the bottom out of this story, so it was
regretfully dismissed.Whatever the reason, the fact remained that
nobody had been discharged, and when pay-time arrived they set out for
the office in high spirits.That evening, the weather being fine, Slyme went out as usual to his
open-air meeting, but Easton departed from HIS usual custom of rushing
off to the 'Cricketers' directly he had had his tea, having on this
occasion promised to wait for Ruth and to go with her to do the
marketing.The baby was left at home alone, asleep in the cradle.By the time they had made all their purchases they had a fairly heavy
load.Easton carried the string-bag containing the potatoes and other
vegetables, and the meat, and Ruth, the groceries.On their way home,
they had to pass the 'Cricketers' and just before they reached that
part of their journey they met Mr and Mrs Crass, who were also out
marketing.They both insisted on Easton and Ruth going in to have a
drink with them.Ruth did not want to go, but she allowed herself to
be persuaded for she could see that Easton was beginning to get angry
with her for refusing.Crass had on a new overcoat and a new hat, with
dark grey trousers and yellow boots, and a'stand-up' collar with a
bright blue tie.His wife--a fat, vulgar-looking, well-preserved woman
about forty--was arrayed in a dark red'motor' costume, with hat to
match.Both Easton and Ruth--whose best clothes had all been pawned to
raise the money to pay the poor rate--felt very mean and shabby before
them.When they got inside, Crass paid for the first round of drinks, a pint
of Old Six for himself; the same for Easton, half a pint for Mrs Easton
and threepenny-worth of gin for Mrs Crass.The Besotted Wretch was there, just finishing a game of hooks and rings
with the Semi-drunk--who had called round on the day after he was
thrown out, to apologize for his conduct to the Old Dear, and had since
then become one of the regular customers.He had
been there that afternoon, so the Old Dear said, but he had gone home
about five o'clock, and had not been back since.He was almost sure to
look in again in the course of the evening.Although the house was not nearly so full as it would have been if
times had been better, there was a large number of people there, for
the 'Cricketers' was one of the most popular houses in the town.Another thing that helped to make them busy was the fact that two other
public houses in the vicinity had recently been closed up.There were
people in all the compartments.Some of the seats in the public bar
were occupied by women, some young and accompanied by their husbands,
some old and evidently sodden with drink.In one corner of the public
bar, drinking beer or gin with a number of young fellows, were three
young girls who worked at a steam laundry in the neighbourhood.Two
large, fat, gipsy-looking women: evidently hawkers, for on the floor
beside them were two baskets containing bundles of
flowers--chrysanthemums and Michaelmas daisies.There were also two
very plainly and shabbily dressed women about thirty-five years of age,
who were always to be found there on Saturday nights, drinking with any
man who was willing to pay for them.The behaviour of these two women
was very quiet and their manners unobtrusive.They seemed to realize
that they were there only on sufferance, and their demeanour was
shamefaced and humble.The floor was sprinkled with
sawdust which served to soak up the beer that slopped out of the
glasses of those whose hands were too unsteady to hold them upright.The air was foul with the smell of beer, spirits and tobacco smoke, and
the uproar was deafening, for nearly everyone was talking at the same
time, their voices clashing discordantly with the strains of the
Polyphone, which was playing 'The Garden of Your Heart'.In one corner
a group of men convulsed with laughter at the details of a dirty story
related by one of their number.Several impatient customers were
banging the bottoms of their empty glasses or pewters on the counter
and shouting their orders for more beer.Oaths, curses and obscene
expressions resounded on every hand, coming almost as frequently from
the women as the men.And over all the rattle of money, the ringing of
the cash register.The clinking and rattling of the glasses and pewter
pots as they were being washed, and the gurgling noise made by the beer
as it poured into the drinking vessels from the taps of the beer
engine, whose handles were almost incessantly manipulated by the
barman, the Old Dear and the glittering landlady, whose silken blouse,
bejewelled hair, ears, neck and fingers scintillated gloriously in the
blaze of the gaslight.The scene was so novel and strange to Ruth that she felt dazed and
bewildered.Previous to her marriage she had been a total abstainer,
but since then she had occasionally taken a glass of beer with Easton
for company's sake with their Sunday dinner at home; but it was
generally Easton who went out and bought the beer in a jug.Once or
twice she had bought it herself at an Off Licence beer-shop near where
they lived, but she had never before been in a public house to drink.She was so confused and ill at ease that she scarcely heard or
understood Mrs Crass, who talked incessantly, principally about their
other residents in North Street where they both resided; and about Mr
Crass.She also promised Ruth to introduce her presently--if he came
in, as he was almost certain to do--to Mr Partaker, one of her two
lodgers a most superior young man, who had been with them now for over
three years and would not leave on any account.In fact, he had been
their lodger in their old house, and when they moved he came with them
to North Street, although it was farther away from his place of
business than their former residence.Mrs Crass talked a lot more of
the same sort of stuff, to which Ruth listened like one in a dream, and
answered with an occasional yes or no.Meantime, Crass and Easton--the latter had deposited the string-bag on
the seat at Ruth's side--and the Semi-drunk and the Besotted Wretch,
arranged to play a match of Hooks and Rings, the losers to pay for
drinks for all the party, including the two women.Crass and the
Semi-drunk tossed up for sides.Crass won and picked the Besotted
Wretch, and the game began.It was a one-sided affair from the first,
for Easton and the Semi-drunk were no match for the other two.The end
of it was that Easton and his partner had to pay for the drinks.The
four men had a pint each of four ale, and Mrs Crass had another
threepennyworth of gin.Ruth protested that she did not want any more
to drink, but the others ridiculed this, and both the Besotted Wretch
and the Semi-drunk seemed to regard her unwillingness as a personal
insult, so she allowed them to get her another half-pint of beer, which
she was compelled to drink, because she was conscious that the others
were watching her to see that she did so.The Semi-drunk now suggested a return match.He was a little out of practice, he said, and was only just
getting his hand in as they were finishing the other game.Crass and
his partner readily assented, and in spite of Ruth's whispered entreaty
that they should return home without further delay, Easton insisted on
joining the game.Although they played more carefully than before, and notwithstanding
the fact that the Besotted Wretch was very drunk, Easton and his
partner were again beaten and once more had to pay for the drinks.The
men had a pint each as before.Mrs Crass--upon whom the liquor so far
seemed to have no effect--had another threepennyworth of gin; and Ruth
consented to take another glass of beer on condition that Easton would
come away directly their drinks were finished.Easton agreed to do so,
but instead of keeping his word he began to play a four-handed game of
shove-ha'penny with the other three, the sides and stakes being
arranged as before.The liquor was by this time beginning to have some effect upon Ruth:
she felt dizzy and confused.Whenever it was necessary to reply to Mrs
Crass's talk she found some difficulty in articulating the words and
she knew she was not answering very intelligently.Even when Mrs Crass
introduced her to the interesting Mr Partaker, who arrived about this
time, she was scarcely able to collect herself sufficiently to decline
that fascinating gentleman's invitation to have another drink with
himself and Mrs Crass.After a time a kind of terror took possession of her, and she resolved
that if Easton would not come when he had finished the game he was
playing, she would go home without him.Meantime the game of shove-ha'penny proceeded merrily, the majority of
the male guests crowding round the board, applauding or censuring the
players as occasion demanded.The Semi-drunk was in high glee, for
Crass was not much of a hand at this game, and the Besotted Wretch,
although playing well, was not able to make up for his partner's want
of skill.As the game drew near its end and it became more and more
certain that his opponents would be defeated, the joy of the Semi-drunk
was unbounded, and he challenged them to make it double or quits--a
generous offer which they wisely declined, and shortly afterwards,
seeing that their position was hopeless, they capitulated and prepared
to pay the penalty of the vanquished.Crass ordered the drinks and the Besotted Wretch paid half the damage--a
pint of four ale for each of the men and the same as before for the
ladies.The Old Dear executed the order, but by mistake, being very
busy, he served two 'threes' of gin instead of one.Ruth did not want
any more at all, but she was afraid to say so, and she did not like to
make any fuss about it being the wrong drink, especially as they all
assured her that the spirits would do her more good than beer.She did
not want either; she wanted to get away, and would have liked to empty
the stuff out of the glass on the floor, but she was afraid that Mrs
Crass or one of the others might see her doing so, and there might be
some trouble about it.Anyway, it seemed easier to drink this small
quantity of spirits and water than a big glass of beer, the very
thought of which now made her feel ill.She drank the stuff which
Easton handed to her at a single draught and, handing back the empty
glass with a shudder, stood up resolutely.'All right: presently,' replied Easton.'There's plenty of time; it's
not nine yet.''That doesn't matter; it's quite late enough.You know we've left the
child at home alone in the house.You promised you'd come as soon as
you'd finished that other game.''All right, all right,' answered Easton impatiently.'Just wait a
minute, I want to see this, and then I'll come.''This' was a most interesting problem propounded by Crass, who had
arranged eleven matches side by side on the shove-ha'penny board.The
problem was to take none away and yet leave only nine.Nearly all the
men in the bar were crowding round the shove-ha'penny board, some with
knitted brows and drunken gravity trying to solve the puzzle and others
waiting curiously for the result.Easton crossed over to see how it
was done, and as none of the crowd were able to do the trick, Crass
showed that it could be accomplished by simply arranging the eleven
matches so as to form the word NINE.Everybody said it was very good
indeed, very clever and interesting.But the Semi-drunk and the
Besotted Wretch were reminded by this trick of several others equally
good, and they proceeded to do them; and then the men had another pint
each all round as a reviver after the mental strain of the last few
minutes.Easton did not know any tricks himself, but he was an interested
spectator of those done by several others until Ruth came over and
touched his arm.'I don't want to stay here any longer,' said Ruth, hysterically.'You
said you'd come as soon as you saw that trick.If you don't come, I
shall go home by myself.I don't want to stay in this place any
longer.''Well, go by yourself if you want to!'shouted Easton fiercely, pushing
her away from him.'I shall stop 'ere as long as I please, and if you
don't like it you can do the other thing.'Ruth staggered and nearly fell from the force of the push he gave her,
and the man turned again to the table to watch the Semi-drunk, who was
arranging six matches so as to form the numeral XII, and who said he
could prove that this was equal to a thousand.Ruth waited a few minutes longer, and then as Easton took no further
notice of her, she took up the string-bag and the other parcels, and
without staying to say good night to Mrs Crass--who was earnestly
conversing with the interesting Partaker--she with some difficulty
opened the door and went out into the street.The cold night air felt
refreshing and sweet after the foul atmosphere of the public house, but
after a little while she began to feel faint and dizzy, and was
conscious also that she was walking unsteadily, and she fancied that
people stared at her strangely as they passed.The parcels felt very
heavy and awkward to carry, and the string-bag seemed as if it were
filled with lead.Although under ordinary circumstances it was only about ten minutes'
walk home from here, she resolved to go by one of the trams which
passed by the end of North Street.With this intention, she put down
her bag on the pavement at the stopping-place, and waited, resting her
hand on the iron pillar at the corner of the street, where a little
crowd of people were standing evidently with the same object as
herself.Two trains passed without stopping, for they were already
full of passengers, a common circumstance on Saturday nights.The next
one stopped, and several persons alighted, and then ensued a fierce
struggle amongst the waiting crowd for the vacant seats.Men and women
pushed, pulled and almost fought, shoving their fists and elbows into
each other's sides and breasts and faces.Ruth was quickly thrust
aside and nearly knocked down, and the tram, having taken aboard as
many passengers as it had accommodation for, passed on.She waited for
the next one, and the same scene was enacted with the same result for
her, and then, reflecting that if she had not stayed for these trams
she might have been home by now, she determined to resume her walk.The parcels felt heavier than ever, and she had not proceeded very far
before she was compelled to put the bag down again upon the pavement,
outside an empty house.Leaning against the railings, she felt very tired and ill.Everything
around her--the street, the houses, the traffic--seemed vague and
shadowy and unreal.Several people looked curiously at her as they
passed, but by this time she was scarcely conscious of their scrutiny.Slyme had gone that evening to the usual 'open-air' conducted by the
Shining Light Mission.The weather being fine, they had a most
successful meeting, the disciples, including Hunter, Rushton, Sweater,
Didlum, and Mrs Starvem--Ruth's former mistress--assembled in great
force so as to be able to deal more effectively with any infidels or
hired critics or drunken scoffers who might try to disturb the
proceedings; and--possibly as an evidence of how much real faith there
was in them--they had also arranged to have a police officer in
attendance, to protect them from what they called the 'Powers of
Darkness'.One might be excused for thinking that--if they really
believed--they would have relied rather upon those powers of Light
which they professed to represent on this planet to protect them
without troubling to call in the aid of such a 'worldly' force as the
police.However, it came to pass that on this occasion the only
infidels present were those who were conducting the meeting, but as
these consisted for the most part of members of the chapel, it will be
seen that the infidel fraternity was strongly represented.On his way home after the meeting Slyme had to pass by the 'Cricketers'
and as he drew near the place he wondered if Easton was there, but he
did not like to go and look in, because he was afraid someone might see
him coming away and perhaps think he had been in to drink.Just as he
arrived opposite the house another man opened the door of the public
bar and entered, enabling Slyme to catch a momentary glimpse of the
interior, where he saw Easton and Crass with a number of others who
were strangers to him, laughing and drinking together.Slyme hurried away; it had turned very cold, and he was anxious to get
home.As he approached the place where the trams stopped to take up
passengers and saw that there was a tram in sight he resolved to wait
for it and ride home: but when the tram arrived and there were only one
or two seats vacant, and although he did his best to secure one of
these he was unsuccessful, and after a moment's hesitation he decided
that it would be quicker to walk than to wait for the next one.He
accordingly resumed his journey, but he had not gone very far when he
saw a small crowd of people on the pavement on the other side of the
road outside an unoccupied house, and although he was in a hurry to get
home he crossed over to see what was the matter.There were about
twenty people standing there, and in the centre close to the railing
there were three or four women whom Slyme could not see although he
could hear their voices.he inquired of a man on the edge of the crowd.'Oh, nothing much,' returned the other.'Some young woman; she's
either ill, come over faint, or something--or else she's had a drop too
much.''Quite a respectable-looking young party, too,' said another man.Several young fellows in the crowd were amusing themselves by making
suggestive jokes about the young woman and causing some laughter by the
expressions of mock sympathy.'Doesn't anyone know who she is?'said the second man who had spoken in
reply to Slyme's inquiry.'No,' said a woman who was standing a little nearer the middle of the
crowd.'And she won't say where she lives.''She'll be all right now she's had that glass of soda,' said another
man, elbowing his way out of the crowd.As this individual came out,
Slyme managed to work himself a little further into the group of
people, and he uttered an involuntary cry of astonishment as he caught
sight of Ruth, very pale, and looking very ill, as she stood clasping
one of the railings with her left hand and holding the packages of
groceries in the other.She had by this time recovered sufficiently to
feel overwhelmed with shame and confusion before the crowd of strangers
who hemmed her in on every side, and some of whom she could hear
laughing and joking about her.It was therefore with a sensation of
intense relief and gratitude that she saw Slyme's familiar face and
heard his friendly voice as he forced his way through to her side.'I can walk home all right now,' she stammered in reply to his anxious
questioning.'If you wouldn't mind carrying some of these things for
me.'He insisted on taking all the parcels, and the crowd, having jumped to
the conclusion that he was the young woman's husband began to dwindle
away, one of the jokers remarking 'It's all over!'in a loud voice as
he took himself off.It was only about seven minutes' walk home from there, and as the
streets along which they had to pass were not very brilliantly lighted,
Ruth was able to lean on Slyme's arm most of the way.When they
arrived home, after she had removed her hat, he made her sit down in
the armchair by the fire, which was burning brightly, and the kettle
was singing on the hob, for she had banked up the fire with cinders and
small coal before she went out.The baby was still asleep in the cradle, but his slumbers had evidently
not been of the most restful kind, for he had kicked all the bedclothes
off him and was lying all uncovered.Ruth obeyed passively when Slyme
told her to sit down, and, lying back languidly in the armchair, she
watched him through half-closed eyes and with a slight flush on her
face as he deftly covered the sleeping child with the bedclothes and
settled him more comfortably in the cot.Slyme now turned his attention to the fire, and as he placed the kettle
upon it he remarked: 'As soon as the water boils I'll make you some
strong tea.'During their walk home she had acquainted Slyme with the cause of her
being in the condition in which he found her in the street, and as she
reclined in the armchair, drowsily watching him, she wondered what
would have happened to her if he had not passed by when he did.I feel quite well now; but I'm afraid I've given you a
lot of trouble.'Nothing I can do for you is a trouble to me.But
don't you think you'd better take your jacket off?It took a very long time to get this jacket off, because whilst he was
helping her, Slyme kissed her repeatedly and passionately as she lay
limp and unresisting in his arms.Chapter 25

The Oblong


During the following week the work at 'The Cave' progressed rapidly
towards completion, although, the hours of daylight being so few, the
men worked only from 8 A.M.and they had their breakfasts
before they came.This made 40 hours a week, so that those who were
paid sevenpence an hour earned L1.3.4.Those who got
sixpence-halfpenny drew L1.1.8.Those whose wages were fivepence an
hour were paid the princely sum of 16/8d.for their week's hard labour,
and those whose rate was fourpence-halfpenny 'picked up' 15/-.And yet there are people who have the insolence to say that Drink is
the cause of poverty.And many of the persons who say this, spend more money than that on
drink themselves--every day of their useless lives.By Tuesday night all the inside was finished with the exception of the
kitchen and scullery.The painting of the kitchen had been delayed
owing to the non-arrival of the new cooking range, and the scullery was
still used as the paint shop.The outside work was also nearly
finished: all the first coating was done and the second coating was
being proceeded with.According to the specification, all the outside
woodwork was supposed to have three coats, and the guttering,
rain-pipes and other ironwork two coats, but Crass and Hunter had
arranged to make two coats do for most of the windows and woodwork, and
all the ironwork was to be made to do with one coat only.The windows
were painted in two colours: the sashes dark green and the frames
white.All the rest--gables, doors, railings, guttering, etc.--was
dark green; and all the dark green paint was made with boiled linseed
oil and varnish; no turpentine being allowed to be used on this part of
the work.'This is some bloody fine stuff to 'ave to use, ain't it?'remarked
Harlow to Philpot on Wednesday morning.'It's more like a lot of
treacle than anything else.''Yes: and it won't arf blister next summer when it gets a bit of sun on
it,' replied Philpot with a grin.'I suppose they're afraid that if they was to put a little turps in, it
wouldn't bear out, and they'd 'ave to give it another coat.''You can bet yer life that's the reason,' said Philpot.'But all the
same I mean to pinch a drop to put in mine as soon as Crass is gorn.'Didn't you
see that corfin plate what Owen was writing in the drorin'-room last
Saturday morning?'Don't you remember I was sent away to do a ceilin'
and a bit of painting over at Windley?''Oh, of course; I forgot,' exclaimed Philpot.'I reckon Crass and Slyme must be making a small fortune out of all
these funerals,' said Harlow.'This makes the fourth in the last
fortnight.'A shillin' for taking' 'ome the corfin and liftin' in the corpse, and
four bob for the funeral--five bob altogether.''That's a bit of all right, ain't it?''A couple of them
in a week besides your week's wages, eh?Five bob for two or three
hours work!''Yes, the money's all right, mate, but they're welcome to it for my
part.I don't want to go messin' about with no corpses,' replied
Philpot with a shudder.'Who is this last party what's dead?''It's a parson what used to belong to the "Shining Light" Chapel.He'd
been abroad for 'is 'ollerdays--to Monte Carlo.It seems 'e was ill
before 'e went away, but the change did 'im a lot of good; in fact, 'e
was quite recovered, and 'e was coming back again.But while 'e was
standin' on the platform at Monte Carlo Station waitin' for the train,
a porter runned into 'im with a barrer load o' luggage, and 'e blowed
up.'But they swep' 'em all up and put it in a corfin and it's to
be planted this afternoon.'Harlow maintained an awestruck silence, and Philpot continued:

'I had a drink the other night with a butcher bloke what used to serve
this parson with meat, and we was talkin' about what a strange sort of
death it was, but 'e said 'e wasn't at all surprised to 'ear of it; the
only thing as 'e wondered at was that the man didn't blow up long ago,
considerin' the amount of grub as 'e used to make away with.He ses
the quantities of stuff as 'e's took there and seen other tradesmen
take was something chronic.You must 'ave noticed 'im about the town.A very fat chap,'
replied Philpot.'I'm sorry you wasn't 'ere on Saturday to see the
corfin plate.Frank called me in to see the wordin' when 'e'd finished
it.It had on: "Jonydab Belcher.Ascended,
December 8th, 19--"'

'Oh, I know the bloke now!''I remember my youngsters
bringin' 'ome a subscription list what they'd got up at the Sunday
School to send 'im away for a 'ollerday because 'e was ill, and I gave
'em a penny each to put on their cards because I didn't want 'em to
feel mean before the other young 'uns.'Two or three young 'uns asked me to give
'em something to put on at the time.And I see they've got another
subscription list on now.I met one of Newman's children yesterday and
she showed it to me.It's for an entertainment and a Christmas Tree
for all the children what goes to the Sunday School, so I didn't mind
giving just a trifle for anything like that.'...'Seems to be gettin' colder, don't it?''It's enough to freeze the ears orf a brass monkey!'remarked Easton as
he descended from a ladder close by and, placing his pot of paint on
the pound, began to try to warm his hands by rubbing and beating them
together.He was trembling, and his teeth were chattering with cold.'I could just do with a nice pint of beer, now,' he said as he stamped
his feet on the pound.'That's just what I was thinkin',' said Philpot, wistfully, 'and what's
more, I mean to 'ave one, too, at dinner-time.I shall nip down to the
"Cricketers".Even if I don't get back till a few minutes after one,
it won't matter, because Crass and Nimrod will be gorn to the funeral.''Will you bring me a pint back with you, in a bottle?'He also would have liked a pint of beer, but, as
was usual with him, he had not the necessary cash.Having restored the
circulation to a certain extent, they now resumed their work, and only
just in time, for a few minutes afterwards they observed Misery peeping
round the corner of the house at them and they wondered how long he had
been there, and whether he had overheard their conversation.At twelve o'clock Crass and Slyme cleared off in a great hurry, and a
little while afterwards, Philpot took off his apron and put on his coat
to go to the 'Cricketers'.When the others found out where he was
going, several of them asked him to bring back a drink for them, and
then someone suggested that all those who wanted some beer should give
twopence each.This was done: one shilling and fourpence was collected
and given to Philpot, who was to bring back a gallon of beer in a jar.He promised to get back as soon as ever he could, and some of the
shareholders decided not to drink any tea with their dinners, but to
wait for the beer, although they knew that it would be nearly time to
resume work before he could get back.It would be a quarter to one at
the very earliest.The minutes dragged slowly by, and after a while the only man on the
job who had a watch began to lose his temper and refused to answer any
more inquiries concerning the time.So presently Bert was sent up to
the top of the house to look at a church clock which was visible
therefrom, and when he came down he reported that it was ten minutes to
one.Symptoms of anxiety now began to manifest themselves amongst the
shareholders, several of whom went down to the main road to see if
Philpot was yet in sight, but each returned with the same report--they
could see nothing of him.No one was formally 'in charge' of the job during Crass's absence, but
they all returned to their work promptly at one because they feared
that Sawkins or some other sneak might report any irregularity to Crass
or Misery.At a quarter-past one, Philpot was still missing and the uneasiness of
the shareholders began to develop into a panic.Some of them plainly
expressed the opinion that he had gone on the razzle with the money.As
the time wore on, this became the general opinion.At two o'clock, all
hope of his return having been abandoned, two or three of the
shareholders went and drank some of the cold tea.Their fears were only too well founded, for they saw no more of Philpot
till the next morning, when he arrived looking very sheepish and
repentant and promised to refund all the money on Saturday.He also
made a long, rambling statement from which it appeared that on his way
to the 'Cricketers' he met a couple of chaps whom he knew who were out
of work, and he invited them to come and have a drink.When they got
to the pub, they found there the Semi-drunk and the Besotted Wretch.One drink led to another, and then they started arguing, and he had
forgotten all about the gallon of beer until he woke up this morning.Whilst Philpot was making this explanation they were putting on their
aprons and blouses, and Crass was serving out the lots of colour.Slyme
took no part in the conversation, but got ready as quickly as possible
and went outside to make a start.The reason for this haste soon
became apparent to some of the others, for they noticed that he had
selected and commenced painting a large window that was so situated as
to be sheltered from the keen wind that was blowing.The basement of the house was slightly below the level of the ground
and there was a sort of a trench or area about three feet deep in front
of the basement windows.The banks of this trench were covered with
rose trees and evergreens, and the bottom was a mass of slimy,
evil-smelling, rain-sodden earth, foul with the excrement of nocturnal
animals.To second-coat these basement windows, Philpot and Harlow had
to get down into and stand in all this filth, which soaked through the
worn and broken soles of their boots.As they worked, the thorns of
the rose trees caught and tore their clothing and lacerated the flesh
of their half-frozen hands.Owen and Easton were working on ladders doing the windows immediately
above Philpot and Harlow, Sawkins, on another ladder, was painting one
of the gables, and the other men were working at different parts of the
outside of the house.The boy Bert was painting the iron railings of
the front fence.The weather was bitterly cold, the sun was concealed
by the dreary expanse of grey cloud that covered the wintry sky.As they stood there working most of the time they were almost perfectly
motionless, the only part of their bodies that were exercised being
their right arms.The work they were now doing required to be done
very carefully and deliberately, otherwise the glass would be'messed
up' or the white paint of the frames would 'run into' the dark green of
the sashes, both colours being wet at the same time, each man having
two pots of paint and two sets of brushes.The wind was not blowing in
sudden gusts, but swept by in a strong, persistent current that
penetrated their clothing and left them trembling and numb with cold.It blew from the right; and it was all the worse on that account,
because the right arm, being in use, left that side of the body fully
exposed.They were able to keep their left hands in their trousers
pockets and the left arm close to the side most of the time.Another reason why it is worse when the wind strikes upon one from the
right side is that the buttons on a man's coat are always on the right
side, and consequently the wind gets underneath.Philpot realized this
all the more because some of the buttons on his coat and waistcoat were
missing.As they worked on, trembling with cold, and with their teeth
chattering, their faces and hands became of that pale violet colour
generally seen on the lips of a corpse.Their eyes became full of
water and the lids were red and inflamed.Philpot's and Harlow's boots
were soon wet through, with the water they absorbed from the damp
ground, and their feet were sore and intensely painful with cold.Their hands, of course, suffered the most, becoming so numbed that they
were unable to feel the brushes they held; in fact, presently, as
Philpot was taking a dip of colour, the brush fell from his hand into
the pot; and then, finding that he was unable to move his fingers, he
put his hand into his trousers pocket to thaw, and began to walk about,
stamping his feet upon the ground.His example was quickly followed by
Owen, Easton and Harlow, and they all went round the corner to the
sheltered side of the house where Slyme was working, and began walking
up and down, rubbing their hands, stamping their feet and swinging
their arms to warm themselves.'If I thought Nimrod wasn't comin', I'd put my overcoat on and work in
it,' remarked Philpot, 'but you never knows when to expect the b--r,
and if 'e saw me in it, it would mean the bloody push.''It wouldn't interfere with our workin' if we did wear 'em,' said
Easton; 'in fact, we'd be able to work all the quicker if we wasn't so
cold.''Even if Misery didn't come, I suppose Crass would 'ave something to
say if we did put 'em on,' continued Philpot.'Well, yer couldn't blame 'im if 'e did say something, could yer?''Crass would get into a row 'imself if 'Unter came
and saw us workin' in overcoats.Slyme suffered less from the cold than any of them, not only because he
had secured the most sheltered window, but also because he was better
clothed than most of the rest.'What's Crass supposed to be doin' inside?'asked Easton as he tramped
up and down, with his shoulders hunched up and his hands thrust deep
into the pockets of his trousers.'Blowed if I know,' replied Philpot.'Messin' about touchin' up or
makin' colour.He never does 'is share of a job like this; 'e knows
'ow to work things all right for 'isself.'We'd be the same if we was in 'is place, and so
would anybody else,' said Slyme, and added sarcastically: 'Or p'haps
you'd give all the soft jobs to other people and do all the rough
yerself!'Slyme knew that, although they were speaking of Crass, they were also
alluding to himself, and as he replied to Philpot he looked slyly at
Owen, who had so far taken no part in the conversation.'It's not a question of what we would do,' chimed in Harlow.'It's a
question of what's fair.If it's not fair for Crass to pick all the
soft jobs for 'imself and leave all the rough for others, the fact that
we might do the same if we 'ad the chance don't make it right.''No one can be blamed for doing the best he can for himself under
existing circumstances,' said Owen in reply to Slyme's questioning
look.That is the principle of the present system--every man for
himself and the devil take the rest.For my own part I don't pretend
to practise unselfishness.I don't pretend to guide my actions by the
rules laid down in the Sermon on the Mount.But it's certainly
surprising to hear you who profess to be a follower of
Christ--advocating selfishness.Or, rather, it would be surprising if
it were not that the name of "Christian" has ceased to signify one who
follows Christ, and has come to mean only liar and hypocrite.'Possibly the fact that he was a true believer
enabled him to bear this insult with meekness and humility.growled Easton as they returned to work.Only two more hours, but to these miserable, half-starved, ill-clad
wretches, standing here in the bitter wind that pierced their clothing
and seemed to be tearing at their very hearts and lungs with icy
fingers, it appeared like an eternity.To judge by the eagerness with
which they longed for dinner-time, one might have thought they had some
glorious banquet to look forward to instead of bread and cheese and
onions, or bloaters--and stewed tea.Two more hours of torture before dinner; and three more hours after
that.And then, thank God, it would be too dark to see to work any
longer.It would have been much better for them if, instead of being 'Freemen',
they had been slaves, and the property, instead of the hirelings, of Mr
Rushton.As it was, HE would not have cared if one or all of them had
become ill or died from the effects of exposure.It would have made no
difference to him.There were plenty of others out of work and on the
verge of starvation who would be very glad to take their places.But
if they had been Rushton's property, such work as this would have been
deferred until it could be done without danger to the health and lives
of the slaves; or at any rate, even if it were proceeded with during
such weather, their owner would have seen to it that they were properly
clothed and fed; he would have taken as much care of them as he would
of his horse.If they were to
overwork a horse and make it ill, it would cost something for medicine
and the veterinary surgeon, to say nothing of the animal's board and
lodging.If they were to work their horses to death, they would have
to buy others.But none of these considerations applies to workmen.If
they work a man to death they can get another for nothing at the corner
of the next street.They don't have to buy him; all they have to do is
to give him enough money to provide him with food and clothing--of a
kind--while he is working for them.If they only make him ill, they
will not have to feed him or provide him with medical care while he is
laid up.He will either go without these things or pay for them
himself.At the same time it must be admitted that the workman scores
over both the horse and the slave, inasmuch as he enjoys the priceless
blessing of Freedom.If he does not like the hirer's conditions he
need not accept them.He can refuse to work, and he can go and starve.He is the Heir of all
the Ages.He has the right to choose
freely which he will do--Submit or Starve.The sky, which at first had shown
small patches of blue through rifts in the masses of clouds, had now
become uniformly grey.There was every indication of an impending fall
of snow.If it did commence
to snow, they would not be able to continue this work, and therefore
they found themselves involuntarily wishing that it would snow, or
rain, or hail, or anything that would stop the work.But on the other
hand, if the weather prevented them getting on with the outside, some
of them would have to'stand off', because the inside was practically
finished.None of them wished to lose any time if they could possibly
help it, because there were only ten days more before Christmas.The morning slowly wore away and the snow did not fall.The hands
worked on in silence, for they were in no mood for talking, and not
only that, but they were afraid that Hunter or Rushton or Crass might
be watching them from behind some bush or tree, or through some of the
windows.This dread possessed them to such an extent that most of them
were almost afraid even to look round, and kept steadily on at work.None of them wished to spoil his chance of being kept on to help to do
the other house that it was reported Rushton & Co.were going to 'do
up' for Mr Sweater.Twelve o'clock came at last, and Crass's whistle had scarcely ceased to
sound before they all assembled in the kitchen before the roaring fire.Sweater had sent in two tons of coal and had given orders that fires
were to be lit every day in nearly every room to make the house
habitable by Christmas.'I wonder if it's true as the firm's got another job to do for old
Sweater?'remarked Harlow as he was toasting a bloater on the end of
the pointed stick.said the man on the pail scornfully.You
know that empty 'ouse as they said Sweater 'ad bought--the one that
Rushton and Nimrod was seen lookin' at?''Well, they wasn't pricing it up after all!The landlord of that 'ouse
is abroad, and there was some plants in the garden as Rushton thought
'e'd like, and 'e was tellin' Misery which ones 'e wanted.And
afterwards old Pontius Pilate came up with Ned Dawson and a truck.They
made two or three journeys and took bloody near everything in the
garden as was worth takin'.What didn't go to Rushton's place went to
'Unter's.'The disappointment of their hopes for another job was almost forgotten
in their interest in this story.Ned Dawson, usually called 'Bundy's mate', had been away from the house
for a few days down at the yard doing odd jobs, and had only come back
to the 'Cave' that morning.On being appealed to, he corroborated Dick
Wantley's statement.'They'll be gettin' theirselves into trouble if they ain't careful,'
remarked Easton.'Oh, no they won't, Rushton's too artful for that.It seems the agent
is a pal of 'is, and they worked it between 'em.''Oh, that's nothing to some of the things I've known 'em do before
now,' said the man on the pail.'Why, don't you remember, back in the
summer, that carved hoak hall table as Rushton pinched out of that
'ouse on Grand Parade?''Yes; that was a bit of all right too, wasn't it?'cried Philpot, and
several of the others laughed.'You know, that big 'ouse we did up last summer--No.596,' Wantley
continued, for the benefit of those not 'in the know'.'Well, it 'ad
bin empty for a long time and we found this 'ere table in a cupboard
under the stairs.One of them bracket
tables what you fix to the wall, without no legs.It 'ad a 'arf-round
marble top to it, and underneath was a carved hoak figger, a mermaid,
with 'er arms up over 'er 'ead 'oldin' up the table top--something
splendid!'The man on the pail waxed enthusiastic as he thought of it.'Must 'ave been worth at least five quid.Well, just as we pulled this
'ere table out, who should come in but Rushton, and when 'e seen it, 'e
tells Crass to cover it over with a sack and not to let nobody see it.And then 'e clears orf to the shop and sends the boy down with the
truck and 'as it took up to 'is own 'ouse, and it's there now, fixed in
the front 'all.I was sent up there a couple of months ago to paint
and varnish the lobby doors and I seen it meself.There's a pitcher
called "The Day of Judgement" 'angin' on the wall just over it--thunder
and lightning and earthquakes and corpses gettin' up out o' their
graves--something bloody 'orrible!And underneath the picture is a card
with a tex out of the Bible--"Christ is the 'ead of this 'ouse: the
unknown guest at every meal.The silent listener to every
conversation."I was workin' there for three or four days and I got to
know it orf by 'eart.''Well, that takes the biskit, don't it?''Yes: but the best of it was,' the man on the pail proceeded, 'the best
of it was, when ole Misery 'eard about the table, 'e was so bloody wild
because 'e didn't get it 'imself that 'e went upstairs and pinched one
of the venetian blinds and 'ad it took up to 'is own 'ouse by the boy,
and a few days arterwards one of the carpenters 'ad to go and fix it up
in 'is bedroom.''Well, there was a bit of talk about it.The agent wanted to know
where it was, but Pontius Pilate swore black and white as there 'adn't
been no blind in that room, and the end of it was that the firm got the
order to supply a new one.''What I can't understand is, who did the table belong to?''It was a fixture belongin' to the 'ouse,' replied Wantley.'But I
suppose the former tenants had some piece of furniture of their own
that they wanted to put in the 'all where this table was fixed, so they
took it down and stored it away in this 'ere cupboard, and when they
left the 'ouse I suppose they didn't trouble to put it back again.Anyway, there was the mark on the wall where it used to be fixed, but
when we did the staircase down, the place was papered over, and I
suppose the landlord or the agent never give the table a thought.Anyhow, Rushton got away with it all right.'A number of similar stories were related by several others concerning
the doings of different employers they had worked for, but after a time
the conversation reverted to the subject that was uppermost in their
thoughts--the impending slaughter, and the improbability of being able
to obtain another job, considering the large number of men who were
already out of employment.'I can't make it out, myself,' remarked Easton.'Things seems to get
worse every year.There don't seem to be 'arf the work about that
there used to be, and even what there is is messed up anyhow, as if the
people who 'as it done can't afford to pay for it.''Yes,' said Harlow; 'that's true enough.Why, just look at the work
that's in one o' them 'ouses on the Grand Parade.People must 'ave 'ad
more money to spend in those days, you know; all those massive curtain
cornishes over the drawing- and dining-room winders--gilded solid!Why, nowadays they'd want all the bloody 'ouse done down right
through--inside and out, for the money it cost to gild one of them.''It seems that nearly everybody is more or less 'ard up nowadays,' said
Philpot.'I'm jiggered if I can understand it, but there it is.''You should ast Owen to explain it to yer,' remarked Crass with a
jeering laugh.''E knows all about wot's the cause of poverty, but 'e
won't tell nobody.'E's been GOIN' to tell us wot it is for a long
time past, but it don't seem to come orf.'Crass had not yet had an opportunity of producing the Obscurer cutting,
and he made this remark in the hope of turning the conversation into a
channel that would enable him to do so.But Owen did not respond, and
went on reading his newspaper.'We ain't 'ad no lectures at all lately, 'ave we?'said Harlow in an
injured tone.'I think it's about time Owen explained what the real
cause of poverty is.When Philpot had finished eating his dinner he went out of the kitchen
and presently returned with a small pair of steps, which he opened and
placed in a corner of the room, with the back of the steps facing the
audience.'There's a pulpit for
yer.'cried Crass, feeling in his waistcoat pocket for
the cutting.'Tell us wot's the real cause of poverty.'''Ear, 'ear,' shouted the man on the pail.'Git up into the bloody
pulpit and give us a sermon.'As Owen made no response to the invitations, the crowd began to hoot
and groan.'Come on, man,' whispered Philpot, winking his goggle eye persuasively
at Owen.'Come on, just for a bit of turn, to pass the time away.'Owen accordingly ascended the steps--much to the secret delight of
Crass--and was immediately greeted with a round of enthusiastic
applause.'There you are, you see,' said Philpot, addressing the meeting.'It's
no use booin' and threatenin', because 'e's one of them lecturers wot
can honly be managed with kindness.If it 'adn't a bin for me, 'e
wouldn't 'ave agreed to speak at all.'Philpot having been unanimously elected chairman, proposed by Harlow
and seconded by the man on the pail, Owen commenced:

'Mr Chairman and gentlemen:

'Unaccustomed as I am to public speaking, it is with some degree of
hesitation that I venture to address myself to such a large,
distinguished, fashionable, and intelligent looking audience as that
which I have the honour of seeing before me on the present occasion.''One of the finest speakers I've ever 'eard!'remarked the man on the
pail in a loud whisper to the chairman, who motioned him to be silent.Owen continued:

'In some of my previous lectures I have endeavoured to convince you
that money is in itself of no value and of no real use whatever.In
this I am afraid I have been rather unsuccessful.''Not a bit of it, mate,' cried Crass, sarcastically.''Ear, 'ear,' shouted Easton.'If a bloke was to come in 'ere now and
orfer to give me a quid--I'd refuse it!''Well, whether you agree or not, the fact remains.A man might possess
so much money that, in England, he would be comparatively rich, and yet
if he went to some country where the cost of living is very high he
would find himself in a condition of poverty.Or one might conceivably
be in a place where the necessaries of life could not be bought for
money at all.Therefore it is more conducive to an intelligent
understanding of the subject if we say that to be rich consists not
necessarily in having much money, but in being able to enjoy an
abundance of the things that are made by work; and that poverty
consists not merely in being without money, but in being short of the
necessaries and comforts of life--or in other words in being short of
the Benefits of Civilization, the things that are all, without
exception, produced by work.Whether you agree or not with anything
else that I say, you will all admit that that is our condition at the
present time.We do not enjoy a full share of the benefits of
civilization--we are all in a state of more or less abject poverty.'cried Crass, and there were loud murmurs of indignant
dissent from several quarters as Owen proceeded:

'How does it happen that we are so short of the things that are made by
work?''The reason why we're short of the things that's made by work,'
interrupted Crass, mimicking Owen's manner, 'is that we ain't got the
bloody money to buy 'em.''Yes,' said the man on the pail; 'and as I said before, if all the
money in the country was shared out equal today according to Owen's
ideas--in six months' time it would be all back again in the same 'ands
as it is now, and what are you goin' to do then?'This answer came derisively from several places at the same instant,
and then they all began speaking at once, vying with each other in
ridiculing the foolishness of 'them there Socialists', whom they called
'The Sharers Out'.Barrington was almost the only one who took no part in the
conversation.He was seated in his customary place and, as usual,
silently smoking, apparently oblivious to his surroundings.'I never said anything about "sharing out all the money",' said Owen
during a lull in the storm, 'and I don't know of any Socialist who
advocates anything of the kind.Can any of you tell me the name of
someone who proposes to do so?'No one answered, as Owen repeated his inquiry, this time addressing
himself directly to Crass, who had been one of the loudest in
denouncing and ridiculing the 'Sharers Out'.Thus cornered, Crass--who
knew absolutely nothing about the subject--for a few moments looked
rather foolish.Then he began to talk in a very loud voice:

'Why, it's a well-known fact.But they take bloody good care they don't act up to it theirselves,
though.Look at them there Labour members of Parliament--a lot of
b--rs what's too bloody lazy to work for their livin'!What the bloody
'ell was they before they got there?Only workin' men, the same as you
and me!But they've got the gift o' the gab and--'

'Yes, we know all about that,' said Owen, 'but what I'm asking you is
to tell us who advocates taking all the money in the country and
sharing it out equally?''And I say that everybody knows that's what they're after!''And you know it as well as I do.'Accordin' to that idear, a bloody scavenger or a farm
labourer ought to get as much wages as you or me!''We can talk about that some other time.What I want to know at
present is--what authority have you for saying that Socialists believe
in sharing out all the money equally amongst all the people?''Well, that's what I've always understood they believed in doing,' said
Crass rather lamely.'It's a well-known fact,' said several others.'Come to think of it,' continued Crass as he drew the Obscurer cutting
from his waistcoat pocket, 'I've got a little thing 'ere that I've been
goin' to read to yer.Remarking that the print was too small for his own eyes, he passed the
slip of paper to Harlow, who read aloud as follows:

    PROVE YOUR PRINCIPLES: OR, LOOK AT BOTH SIDES

    'I wish I could open your eyes to the true misery of our
    condition: injustice, tyranny and oppression!'said a discontented
    hack to a weary-looking cob as they stood side by side in unhired
    cabs.'I'd rather have them opened to something pleasant, thank you,'
    replied the cob.If you could enter into the noble
    aspirations--' the hack began.said the cob, interrupting
    him.Why, equality, and share and share alike all
    over the world,' said the hack.What right have those sleek, pampered hunters and
    racers to their warm stables and high feed, their grooms and
    jockeys?It is really heart-sickening to think of it,' replied
    the hack.'I don't know but you may be right,' said the cob, 'and to show
    I'm in earnest, as no doubt you are, let me have half the good
    beans you have in your bag, and you shall have half the musty oats
    and chaff I have in mine.There's nothing like proving one's
    principles.''Why don't you go
and share your wages with the chaps what's out of work?''It means that if
the Editor of the Obscurer put that in his paper as an argument against
Socialism, either he is of feeble intellect himself or else he thinks
that the majority of his readers are.That isn't an argument against
Socialism--it's an argument against the hypocrites who pretend to be
Christians--the people who profess to "Love their neighbours as
themselves"--who pretend to believe in Universal Brotherhood, and that
they do not love the world or the things of the world and say that they
are merely "Pilgrims on their way to a better land".As for why I
don't do it--why should I?But
you're all "Christians"--why don't you do it?''We're not talkin' about religion,' exclaimed Crass, impatiently.I never said anything about "Sharing
Out" or "Bearing one another's burdens".I don't profess to "Give to
everyone who asks of me" or to "Give my cloak to the man who take away
my coat".I have read that Christ taught that His followers must do
all these things, but as I do not pretend to be one of His followers I
don't do them.But you believe in Christianity: why don't you do the
things that He said?'As nobody seemed to know the answer to this question, the lecturer
proceeded:

'In this matter the difference between so-called "Christians" and
Socialists is this: Christ taught the Fatherhood of God and the
Brotherhood of Men.Those who today pretend to be Christ's followers
hypocritically profess to carry out those teachings now.They have arranged "The Battle of Life" system instead!'The Socialist--very much against his will--finds himself in the midst
of this horrible battle, and he appeals to the other combatants to
cease from fighting and to establish a system of Brotherly Love and
Mutual Helpfulness, but he does not hypocritically pretend to practise
brotherly love towards those who will not agree to his appeal, and who
compel him to fight with them for his very life.He knows that in this
battle he must either fight or go under.Therefore, in self-defiance,
he fights; but all the time he continues his appeal for the cessation
of the slaughter.He pleads for the changing of the system.He advocates
Co-operation instead of Competition: but how can he co-operate with
people who insist on competing with him?No individual can practise
co-operation by himself!Socialism can only be practised by the
Community--that is the meaning of the word.At present, the other
members of the community--the "Christians"--deride and oppose the
Socialist's appeal.'It is these pretended Christians who do not practise what they preach,
because, all the time they are singing their songs of Brotherhood and
Love, they are fighting with each other, and strangling each other and
trampling each other underfoot in their horrible "Battle of Life"!'No Socialist suggests "Sharing out" money or anything else in the
manner you say.And another thing: if you only had a little more sense
you might be able to perceive that this stock "argument" of yours is
really an argument against the present system, inasmuch as it proves
that Money is in itself of no use whatever.Supposing all the money
was shared out equally; and suppose there was enough of it for everyone
to have ten thousand pounds; and suppose they then all thought they
were rich and none of them would work.Could they eat it or drink it or wear it?It wouldn't take
them very long to find out that this wonderful money--which under the
present system is the most powerful thing in existence--is really of no
more use than so much dirt.They would speedily perish, not from lack
of money, but from lack of wealth--that is, from lack of things that
are made by work.And further, it is quite true that if all the money
were distributed equally amongst all the people tomorrow, it would all
be up in heaps again in a very short time.But that only proves that
while the present Money System remains, it will be impossible to do
away with poverty, for heaps in some places mean little or nothing in
other places.Therefore while the money system lasts we are bound to
have poverty and all the evils it brings in its train.''Oh, of course everybody's an idjit except you,' sneered Crass, who was
beginning to feel rather fogged.'I rise to a pint of order,' said Easton.'And I rise to order a pint,' cried Philpot.'Order what the bloody 'ell you like,' remarked Harlow,'so long as I
'aven't got to pay for it.''Mine's a pint of porter,' observed the man on the pail.'The pint is,' proceeded Easton, 'when does the lecturer intend to
explain to us what is the real cause of poverty.'''Ear, 'ear,' cried Harlow.'That's what I want to know, too.''And what I should like to know is, who is supposed to be givin' this
'ere lecture?''Why, Owen, of course,' replied Harlow.'Well, why don't you try to keep quiet for a few minutes and let 'im
get on with it?''The next b--r wot interrupts,' cried Philpot, rolling up his
shirt-sleeves and glaring threateningly round upon the meeting.'The
next b--r wot interrupts goes out through the bloody winder!'At this, everybody pretended to be very frightened, and edged away as
far as possible from Philpot.Easton, who was sitting next to him, got
up and crossed over to Owen's vacant seat.The man on the pail was the
only one who did not seem nervous; perhaps he felt safer because he
was, as usual, surrounded by a moat.'Poverty,' resumed the lecturer, consists in a shortage of the
necessaries of life--or rather, of the benefits of civilization.''You've said that about a 'undred times before,' snarled Crass.'I know I have; and I have no doubt I shall have to say it about five
hundred times more before you understand what it means.''Get on with the bloody lecture,' shouted the man on the pail.'Never
mind arguin' the point.''Well, keep horder, can't you?'cried Philpot, fiercely, 'and give the
man a chance.''All these things are produced in the same way,' proceeded Owen.'They
are made from the Raw materials by those who work--aided by machinery.When we inquire into the cause of the present shortage of these things,
the first question we should ask is--Are there not sufficient of the
raw materials in existence to enable us to produce enough to satisfy
the needs of all?'The answer to this question is--There are undoubtedly more than
sufficient of all the raw materials.'Insufficiency of raw material is therefore not the cause.'The next question is--Are we short of labour?Is there not a
sufficient number of people able and willing to work?'The answers to these questions are--There are plenty of people able
and willing to work, and there is plenty of machinery!'These things being so, how comes this extraordinary result?How is it
that the benefits of civilization are not produced in sufficient
quantity to satisfy the needs of all?How is it that the majority of
the people always have to go without most of the refinements, comforts,
and pleasures of life, and very often without even the bare necessaries
of existence?'Plenty of materials--Plenty of Labour--Plenty of Machinery--and,
nearly everybody going short of nearly everything!'The cause of this extraordinary state of affairs is that although we
possess the means of producing more than abundance for all, we also
have an imbecile system of managing our affairs.'The present Money System prevents us from doing the necessary work,
and consequently causes the majority of the population to go short of
the things that can be made by work.They suffer want in the midst of
the means of producing abundance.They remain idle because they are
bound and fettered with a chain of gold.'Let us examine the details of this insane, idiotic, imbecile system.'Owen now asked Philpot to pass him a piece of charred wood from under
the grate, and having obtained what he wanted, he drew upon the wall a
quadrangular figure about four feet in length and one foot deep.The
walls of the kitchen had not yet been cleaned off, so it did not matter
about disfiguring them.+------------------------------------------------------------------+

'To find out the cause of the shortage in this country of the things
that can be made by work it is first of all necessary to find out how
people spend their time.Now this square represents the whole of the
adult population of this country.There are many different classes of
people, engaged in a great number of different occupations.Some of
them are helping to produce the benefits of civilization, and some are
not.All these people help to consume these things, but when we
inquire into their occupations we shall find that although the majority
are workers, only a comparatively small number are engaged in actually
producing either the benefits of civilization or the necessaries of
life.'...Order being once more restored, the lecturer turned again to the
drawing on the wall and stretched out his hand, evidently with the
intention of making some addition to it, but instead of doing so he
paused irresolutely, and faltering, let his arm drop down again by his
side.An absolute, disconcerting silence reigned.His embarrassment and
nervousness increased.He knew that they were unwilling to hear or
talk or think about such subjects as the cause of poverty at all.They
preferred to make fun of and ridicule them.He knew they would refuse
to try to see the meaning of what he wished to say if it were at all
difficult or obscure.How was he to put it to them so that they would
HAVE to understand it whether they wished to or not.It would be easy enough to convince them if they would only take a
LITTLE trouble and try to understand, but he knew that they certainly
would not 'worry' themselves about such a subject as this; it was not
as if it were some really important matter, such as a smutty story, a
game of hooks and rings or shove-ha'penny, something concerning
football or cricket, horse-racing or the doings of some Royal personage
or aristocrat.The problem of the cause of poverty was only something that concerned
their own and their children's future welfare.Such an unimportant
matter, being undeserving of any earnest attention, must be put before
them so clearly and plainly that they would be compelled to understand
it at a glance; and it was almost impossible to do it.Observing his hesitation, some of the men began to snigger.''E seems
to 'ave got 'isself into a bit of a fog,' remarked Crass in a loud
whisper to Slyme, who laughed.The sound roused Owen, who resumed:

'All these people help to consume the things produced by labour.We
will now divide them into separate classes.Those who help to produce;
those who do nothing, those who do harm, and those who are engaged in
unnecessary work.''And,' sneered Crass, 'those who are engaged in unnecessary talk.''First we will separate those who not only do nothing, but do not even
pretend to be of any use; people who would consider themselves
disgraced if they by any chance did any useful work.This class
includes tramps, beggars, the "Aristocracy", "Society" people, great
landowners, and generally all those possessed of hereditary wealth.'As he spoke he drew a vertical line across one end of the oblong.+------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

'These people do absolutely nothing except devour or enjoy the things
produced by the labours of others.'Our next division represents those who do work of a kind--"mental"
work if you like to call it so--work that benefits themselves and harms
other people.Employers--or rather Exploiters of Labour; Thieves,
Swindlers, Pickpockets; profit seeking share-holders; burglars;
Bishops; Financiers; Capitalists, and those persons humorously called
"Ministers" of religion.If you remember that the word "minister"
means "servant" you will be able to see the joke.1             2

'None of these people produce anything themselves, but by means of
cunning and scheming they contrive between them to obtain possession of
a very large portion of the things produced by the labour of others.'Number three stands for those who work for wages or salaries, doing
unnecessary work.That is, producing things or doing things
which--though useful and necessary to the Imbecile System--cannot be
described as the necessaries of life or the benefits of civilization.It comprises Commercial
Travellers, Canvassers, Insurance agents, commission agents, the great
number of Shop Assistants, the majority of clerks, workmen employed in
the construction and adornment of business premises, people occupied
with what they call "Business", which means being very busy without
producing anything.Then there is a vast army of people engaged in
designing, composing, painting or printing advertisements, things which
are for the most part of no utility whatever, the object of most
advertisements is merely to persuade people to buy from one firm rather
than from another.If you want some butter it doesn't matter whether
you buy it from Brown or Jones or Robinson.'1             2             3

During the delivery of this pert of the lecture, the audience began to
manifest symptoms of impatience and dissent.Perceiving this, Owen,
speaking very rapidly, continued:

'If you go down town, you will see half a dozen drapers' shops within a
stone's-throw of each other--often even next door to each other--all
selling the same things.You can't possibly think that all those shops
are really necessary?You know that one of them would serve the
purpose for which they are all intended--to store and serve as a centre
for the distribution of the things that are made by work.If you will
admit that five out of the six shops are not really necessary, you must
also admit that the men who built them, and the salesmen and women or
other assistants engaged in them, and the men who design and write and
print their advertisements are all doing unnecessary work; all really
wasting their time and labour, time and labour that might be employed
in helping to produce these things that we are at present short of.You must admit that none of these people are engaged in producing
either the necessaries of life or the benefits of civilization.They
buy them, and sell them, and handle them, and haggle over, them, and
display them, in the plate glass windows of "Stores" and "Emporiums"
and make profit out of them, and use them, but these people themselves
produce nothing that is necessary to life or happiness, and the things
that some of them do produce are only necessary to the present imbecile
system.''What the 'ell sort of a bloody system do you think we ought to 'ave,
then?''Yes: you're very good at finding fault,' sneered Slyme, 'but why don't
you tell us 'ow it's all going to be put right?''Well, that's not what we're talking about now, is it?''At present we're only trying to find out how it is that there is not
sufficient produced for everyone to have enough of the things that are
made by work.Although most of the people in number three work very
hard, they produce Nothing.''Even if there is more shops than what's actually necessary,' cried
Harlow, 'it all helps people to get a livin'!If half of 'em was shut
up, it would just mean that all them what works there would be out of a
job.Live and let live, I say: all these things makes work.'''Ear, 'ear,' shouted the man behind the moat.'Yes, I know it makes "work",' replied Owen, 'but we can't live on mere
"work", you know.To live in comfort we need a sufficiency of the
things that can be made by work.A man might work very hard and yet be
wasting his time if he were not producing something necessary or useful.'Why are there so many shops and stores and emporiums?Do you imagine
they exist for the purpose of giving those who build them, or work in
them, a chance to earn a living?They are carried
on, and exorbitant prices are charged for the articles they sell, to
enable the proprietors to amass fortunes, and to pay extortionate rents
to the landlords.That is why the wages and salaries of nearly all
those who do the work created by these businesses are cut down to the
lowest possible point.''We knows all about that,' said Crass, 'but you can't get away from it
that all these things makes Work; and that's what we wants--Plenty of
Work.'Cries of ''Ear, 'ear,' and expressions of dissent from the views
expressed by the lecturer resounded through the room, nearly everyone
speaking at the same time.After a while, when the row had in some
measure subsided, Owen resumed:

'Nature has not provided ready-made all the things necessary for the
life and happiness of mankind.In order to obtain these things we have
to Work.The only rational labour is that which is directed to the
creation of those things.Any kind of work which does not help us to
attain this object is a ridiculous, idiotic, criminal, imbecile, waste
of time.'That is what the great army of people represented by division number
three are doing at present: they are all very busy--working very
hard--but to all useful intents and purposes they are doing Nothing.''Well, all right,' said Harlow.''Ave it yer own way, but there's no
need to keep on repeating the same thing over an' over again.''The next division,' resumed Owen,'stands for those who are engaged in
really useful work--the production of the benefits of civilization--the
necessaries, refinements and comforts of life.'1             2             3            4

'Hooray!'shouted Philpot, leading off a cheer which was taken up
enthusiastically by the crowd, 'Hooray!This is where WE comes in,' he
added, nodding his head and winking his goggle eyes at the meeting.'I wish to call the chairman to horder,' said the man on the pail.When Owen had finished writing in the list of occupations several
members of the audience rose to point out that those engaged in the
production of beer had been omitted.Owen rectified this serious
oversight and proceeded:

'As most of the people in number four are out of work at least one
quarter of their time, we must reduce the size of this division by one
fourth--so.'But some of those in number three are often unemployed as well,' said
Harlow.Yes: but as THEY produce nothing even when they are at work we need not
trouble to classify them unemployed, because our present purpose is
only to discover the reason why there is not enough produced for
everyone to enjoy abundance; and this--the Present System of conducting
our affairs--is the reason of the shortage--the cause of poverty.When
you reflect that all the other people are devouring the things produced
by those in number four--can you wonder that there is not plenty for
all?''"Devouring" is a good word,' said Philpot, and the others laughed.The lecturer now drew a small square upon the wall below the other
drawing.1             2             3            4

    How the things produced by the people in division 4 are'shared
         out' amongst the different classes of the population.'Now you mustn't run away with the idea that the people in three and
four take their share quietly and divide the things equally between
them.Some get very little, some none, some more than a
fair share.It is in these two divisions that the ferocious "Battle of
Life" rages most fiercely; and of course in this battle the weak and
the virtuous fare the worst.Even those whose exceptional abilities or
opportunities enable them to succeed, are compelled to practise
selfishness, because a man of exceptional ability who was not selfish
would devote his abilities to relieving the manifest sufferings of
others, and not to his own profit, and if he did the former he would
not be successful in the sense that the world understands the word.All those who really seek to "Love their neighbour as themselves", or
to return good for evil, the gentle, the kind, and all those who
refrain from doing to others the things they would not like to suffer
themselves; all these are of necessity found amongst the vanquished;
because only the worst--only those who are aggressive, cunning, selfish
and mean are fitted to survive.And all these people in numbers three
and four are so fully occupied in this dreadful struggle to secure a
little, that but few of them pause to inquire why there are not more of
the things they are fighting for, or why it is necessary to fight like
this at all!'For a few minutes silence prevailed, each man's mind being busy trying
to think of some objection to the lecturer's arguments.'How could the small number of people in number one and two consume as
much as you've given 'em in your drorin'?''They don't actually consume all of it,' replied Owen.'Much of it is
wantonly wasted.They also make fortunes by selling some of it in
foreign countries; but they consume a great part of it themselves,
because the amount of labour expended on the things enjoyed by these
people is greater than that expended in the production of the things
used by the workers.Most of the people who do nothing get the best of
everything.More than three-quarters of the time of the working
classes is spent in producing the things used by the wealthy.Compare
the quality and quantity of the clothing possessed by the wife or
daughter of a rich man with that of the wife or daughter of a worker.The time and labour spent on producing the one is twenty times greater
in one case than in the other; and it's the same with everything else.Their homes, their clothing, boots, hats, jewellery, and their food.Everything must be of the very best that art or long and painful labour
can produce.But for most of those whose labour produces all these
good things--anything is considered good enough.For themselves, the
philanthropic workers manufacture shoddy cloth--that is, cheap cloth
made of old rags and dirt; and shoddy, uncomfortable ironclad boots.If you see a workman wearing a really good suit of clothes you may
safely conclude that he is either leading an unnatural life--that is,
he is not married--or that he has obtained it from a tallyman on the
hire system and has not yet paid for it--or that it is someone else's
cast-off suit that he has bought second-hand or had given to him by
some charitable person.All the ducks and
geese, pheasants, partridges, and all the very best parts of the very
best meat--all the soles and the finest plaice and salmon and trout--'

''Ere chuck it,' cried Harlow, fiercely.'We don't want to 'ear no
more of it,' and several others protested against the lecturer wasting
time on such mere details.

'--all the very best of everything is reserved exclusively for the
enjoyment of the people in divisions one and two, while the workers
subsist on block ornaments, margarine, adulterated tea, mysterious
beer, and are content--only grumbling when they are unable to obtain
even such fare as this.'Owen paused and a gloomy silence followed, but suddenly Crass
brightened up.He detected a serious flaw in the lecturer's argument.'You say the people in one and two gets all the best of everything, but
what about the tramps and beggars?You see, that's the proper place for them.They are no better mentally or morally than any of
the other loafers in that division; neither are they of any more use.Of course, when we consider them in relation to the amount they consume
of the things produced by others, they are not so harmful as the other
loafers, because they consume comparatively little.But all the same
they are in their right place in that division.All those people don't
get the same share.The section represents not individuals--but the
loafer class.''But I thought you said you was goin' to prove that money was the cause
of poverty,' said Easton.'Can't you see that it's money that's caused
all these people to lose sight of the true purpose of labour--the
production of the things we need?All these people are suffering from
the delusion that it doesn't matter what kind of work they do--or
whether they merely do nothing--so long as they get MONEY for doing it.Under the present extraordinary system, that's the only object they
have in view--to get money.Their ideas are so topsy-turvey that they
regard with contempt those who are engaged in useful work!With the
exception of criminals and the poorer sort of loafers, the working
classes are considered to be the lowest and least worthy in the
community.Those who manage to get money for doing something other
than productive work are considered more worthy of respect on that
account.Those who do nothing themselves, but get money out of the
labour of others, are regarded as being more worthy still!But the
ones who are esteemed most of all and honoured above all the rest, are
those who obtain money for doing absolutely nothing!''But I can't see as that proves that money is the cause of poverty,'
said Easton.'The people in number four produce everything,
don't they?''Yes; we knows all about that,' interrupted Harlow.'But they gets
paid for it, don't they?'Yes, and what does their wages consist of?''Why, money, of course,' replied Harlow, impatiently.And what do they do with their money when they get it?Do they eat it,
or drink it, or wear it?'At this apparently absurd question several of those who had hitherto
been attentive listeners laughed derisively; it was really very
difficult to listen patiently to such nonsense.'Of course they don't,' answered Harlow scornfully.'They buy the
things they want with it.''Do you think that most of them manage to save a part of their
wages--put it away in the bank.''Well, I can speak for meself,' replied Harlow amid laughter.'It
takes me all my bloody time to pay my rent and other expenses and to
keep my little lot in shoe leather, and it's dam little I spend on
beer; p'r'aps a tanner or a bob a week at the most.''A single man can save money if he likes,' said Slyme.'I'm not speaking of single men,' replied Owen.'I'm referring to
those who live natural lives.''What about all the money what's in the Post Office Savings Bank, and
Building and Friendly Societies?''A very large part of that belongs to people who are in business, or
who have some other source of income than their own wages.There are
some exceptionally fortunate workers who happen to have good situations
and higher wages than the ordinary run of workmen.Then there are some
who are so placed--by letting lodgings, for instance--that they are
able to live rent free.Others whose wives go out to work; and others
again who have exceptional jobs and work a lot of overtime--but these
are all exceptional cases.''I say as no married workin' man can save any money at all!'shouted
Harlow, 'not unless 'e goes without some of even the few things we are
able to get--and makes 'is wife and kids go without as well.'''Ear, 'ear,' said everybody except Crass and Slyme, who were both
thrifty working men, and each of them had some money saved in one or
other of the institutions mentioned.'Then that means,' said Owen, 'that means that the wages the people in
division four receive is not equivalent to the work they do.''Why the 'ell don't yer talk
plain English without draggin' in a lot of long words wot nobody can't
understand?''I mean this,' replied Owen, speaking very slowly.'Everything is
produced by the people in number four.In return for their work they
are given--Money, and the things they have made become the property of
the people who do nothing.Then, as the money is of no use, the
workers go to shops and give it away in exchange for some of the things
they themselves have made.They spend--or give back--ALL their wages;
but as the money they got as wages is not equal in value to the things
they produced, they find that they are only able to buy back a VERY
SMALL PART.So you see that these little discs of metal--this
Money--is a device for enabling those who do not work to rob the
workers of the greater part of the fruits of their toil.'The silence that ensued was broken by Crass.'It sounds very pretty,' he sneered, 'but I can't make no 'ead or tail
of it, meself.''The producing class--these people in number
four are supposed to be paid for their work.Their wages are supposed
to be equal in value to their work.If it were, by
spending all their wages, the producing class would be able to buy back
All they had produced.'Owen ceased speaking and silence once more ensued.No one gave any
sign of understanding, or of agreeing or of disagreeing with what he
had said.Barrington's pipe had
gone out during the argument.He relit it from the fire with a piece
of twisted paper.'If their wages were really equal in value to the product of their
labour,' Owen repeated, 'they would be able to buy back not a small
part--but the Whole.'...At this, a remark from Bundy caused a shout of laughter, and when
Wantley added point to the joke by making a sound like the discharge of
a pistol the merriment increased tenfold.'Well, that's done it,' remarked Easton, as he got up and opened the
window.'It's about time you was buried, if the smell's anything to go by,'
said Harlow, addressing Wantley, who laughed and appeared to think he
had distinguished himself.'But even if we include the whole of the working classes,' continued
Owen, 'that is, the people in number three as well as those in number
four, we find that their combined wages are insufficient to buy the
things made by the producers.The total value of the wealth produced
in this country during the last year was L1,800,000,000, and the total
amount paid in wages during the same period was only L600,000,000.In
other words, by means of the Money Trick, the workers were robbed of
two-thirds of the value of their labour.All the people in numbers
three and four are working and suffering and starving and fighting in
order that the rich people in numbers one and two may live in luxury,
and do nothing.These are the wretches who cause poverty: they not
only devour or waste or hoard the things made by the worker, but as
soon as their own wants are supplied--they compel the workers to cease
working and prevent them producing the things they need.cried Owen, his usually pale face flushing red and his eyes
shining with sudden anger,'most of these people do not deserve to be
called human beings at all!They know that whilst
they are indulging in pleasures of every kind--all around them men and
women and little children are existing in want or dying of hunger.'The silence which followed was at length broken by Harlow:

'You say the workers is entitled to all they produce, but you forget
there's the raw materials to pay for.'Of course the workers don't create the raw materials,' replied Owen.'But I am not aware that the capitalists or the landlords do so either.The raw materials exist in abundance in and on the earth, but they are
of no use until labour has been applied to them.''But then, you see, the earth belongs to the landlords!'cried Crass,
unguardedly.'I know that; and of course you think it's right that the whole country
should belong to a few people--'

'I must call the lecturer to horder,' interrupted Philpot.'The land
question is not before the meeting at present.''You talk about the producers being robbed of most of the value of what
they produce,' said Harlow, 'but you must remember that it ain't all
produced by hand labour.What about the things what's made by
machinery?''The machines themselves were made by the workers,' returned Owen, 'but
of course they do not belong to the workers, who have been robbed of
them by means of the Money Trick.''That's more than you or I or anyone else can say,' returned Owen, 'but
it certainly wasn't the wealthy loafer class, or the landlords, or the
employers.Most of the men who invented the machinery lived and died
unknown, in poverty and often in actual want.The inventors too were
robbed by the exploiter-of-labour class.There are no men living at
present who can justly claim to have invented the machinery that exists
today.The most they can truthfully say is that they have added to or
improved upon the ideas of those who lived and worked before them.Even Watt and Stevenson merely improved upon steam engines and
locomotives already existing.Your question has really nothing to do
with the subject we are discussing: we are only trying to find out why
the majority of people have to go short of the benefits of
civilization.One of the causes is--the majority of the population are
engaged in work that does not produce those things; and most of what IS
produced is appropriated and wasted by those who have no right to it.If you walk through the streets of a
town or a city, and look around, Everything that you can
see--Factories, Machinery, Houses, Railways, Tramways, Canals,
Furniture, Clothing, Food and the very road or pavement you stand upon
were all made by the working class, who spend all their wages in buying
back only a very small part of the things they produce.Therefore what
remains in the possession of their masters represents the difference
between the value of the work done and the wages paid for doing it.This systematic robbery has been going on for generations, the value of
the accumulated loot is enormous, and all of it, all the wealth at
present in the possession of the rich, is rightly the property of the
working class--it has been stolen from them by means of the Money
Trick.'...The men stared with
puzzled, uncomfortable looks alternately at each other and at the
drawings on the wall.They were compelled to do a little thinking on
their own account, and it was a process to which they were
unaccustomed.In their infancy they had been taught to distrust their
own intelligence and to leave 'thinking' to their 'pastors' and masters
and to their 'betters' generally.All their lives they had been true
to this teaching, they had always had blind, unreasoning faith in the
wisdom and humanity of their pastors and masters.That was the reason
why they and their children had been all their lives on the verge of
starvation and nakedness, whilst their 'betters'--who did nothing but
the thinking--went clothed in purple and fine linen and fared
sumptuously every day.Several men had risen from their seats and were attentively studying
the diagrams Owen had drawn on the wall; and nearly all the others were
making the same mental efforts--they were trying to think of something
to say in defence of those who robbed them of the fruits of their toil.'I don't see no bloody sense in always runnin' down the rich,' said
Harlow at last.'There's always been rich and poor in the world and
there always will be.''It says in the Bible that the poor shall
always be with us.''What the bloody 'ell kind of system do you think we ought to 'ave?''If everything's wrong, 'ow's it goin' to be altered?'At this, everybody brightened up again, and exchanged looks of
satisfaction and relief.It wasn't necessary to think
about these things at all!Nothing could ever be altered: it had
always been more or less the same, and it always would be.'It seems to me that you all HOPE it is impossible to alter it,' said
Owen.'Without trying to find out whether it could be done, you
persuade yourselves that it is impossible, and then, instead of being
sorry, you're glad!'Some of them laughed in a silly, half-ashamed way.'How do YOU reckon it could be altered?''The way to alter it is, first to enlighten the people as to the real
cause of their sufferings, and then--'

'Well,' interrupted Crass, with a self-satisfied chuckle, 'it'll take a
better bloody man than you to enlighten ME!''I don't want to be henlightened into Darkness!''But what sort of System do you propose, then?''After you've got 'em all enlightened--if you don't believe in sharing
out all the money equal, how ARE you goin' to alter it?''I don't know 'ow 'e's goin' to alter it,' sneered Crass, looking at
his watch and standing up, 'but I do know what the time is--two minits
past one!''The next lecture,' said Philpot, addressing the meeting as they all
prepared to return to work, 'the next lecture will be postponded till
tomorrer at the usual time, when it will be my painful dooty to call
upon Mr Owen to give 'is well-known and most hobnoxious address
entitled "Work and how to avoid it."Hall them as wants to be
henlightened kindly attend.''Or hall them as don't get the sack tonight,' remarked Easton grimly.Chapter 26

The Slaughter


During the afternoon, Rushton and Sweater visited the house, the latter
having an appointment to meet there a gardener to whom he wished to
give instructions concerning the laying out of the grounds, which had
been torn up for the purpose of putting in the new drains.Sweater had
already arranged with the head gardener of the public park to steal
some of the best plants from that place and have them sent up to 'The
Cave'.These plants had been arriving in small lots for about a week.They must have been brought there either in the evening after the men
left off or very early in the morning before they came.The two
gentlemen remained at the house for about half an hour and as they went
away the mournful sound of the Town Hall bell--which was always tolled
to summon meetings of the Council--was heard in the distance, and the
hands remarked to each other that another robbery was about to be
perpetrated.Hunter did not come to the job again that day: he had been sent by
Rushton to price some work for which the firm was going to tender an
estimate.There was only one person who felt any regret at his
absence, and that was Mrs White--Bert's mother, who had been working at
'The Cave' for several days, scrubbing the floors.As a rule, Hunter
paid her wages every night, and on this occasion she happened to need
the money even more than usual.As leaving off time drew near, she
mentioned the matter to Crass, who advised her to call at the office on
her way home and ask the young lady clerk for the money.As Hunter did
not appear, she followed the foreman's advice.When she reached the shop Rushton was just coming out.She explained
to him what she wanted and he instructed Mr Budd to tell Miss Wade to
pay her.The shopman accordingly escorted her to the office at the
back of the shop, and the young lady book-keeper--after referring to
former entries to make quite certain of the amount, paid her the sum
that Hunter had represented as her wages, the same amount that Miss
Wade had on the previous occasions given him to pay the charwoman.When
Mrs White got outside she found that she held in her hand half a crown
instead of the two shillings she usually received from Mr Hunter.At
first she felt inclined to take it back, but after some hesitation she
thought it better to wait until she saw Hunter, when she could tell him
about it; but the next morning when she saw the disciple at 'The Cave'
he broached the subject first, and told her that Miss Wade had made a
mistake.And that evening when he paid her, he deducted the sixpence
from the usual two shillings.The lecture announced by Philpot was not delivered.Anxiously awaiting
the impending slaughter the men kept tearing into it as usual, for they
generally keep working in the usual way, each one trying to outdo the
others so as not to lose his chance of being one of the lucky one...

Misery now went round and informed all the men with the exception of
Crass, Owen, Slyme and Sawkins--that they would have to stand off that
night.He told them that the firm had several jobs in view--work they
had tendered for and hoped to get, and said they could look round after
Christmas and he might--possibly--be able to start some of them again.They would be paid at the office tomorrow--Saturday--at one o'clock as
usual, but if any of them wished they could have their money tonight.The men thanked him, and most of them said they would come for their
wages at the usual pay-time, and would call round as he suggested,
after the holidays, to see if there was anything to do.In all, fifteen men--including Philpot, Harlow, Easton and Ned Dawson,
were to'stand off' that night.They took their dismissal stolidly,
without any remark, some of them even with an affectation of
indifference, but there were few attempts at conversation afterwards.The little work that remained to be done they did in silence, every man
oppressed by the same terror--the dread of the impending want, the
privation and unhappiness that they knew they and their families would
have to suffer during the next few months.Bundy and his mate Dawson were working in the kitchen fixing the new
range in place of the old one which they had taken out.They had been
engaged on this job all day, and their hands and faces and clothes were
covered with soot, which they had also contrived to smear and dab all
over the surfaces of the doors and other woodwork in the room, much to
the indignation of Crass and Slyme, who had to wash it all off before
they could put on the final coat of paint.'You can't help makin' a little mess on a job of this kind, you know,'
remarked Bundy, as he was giving the finishing touches to the work,
making good the broken parts of the wall with cement, whilst his mate
was clearing away the debris.'Yes; but there's no need to claw 'old of the bloody doors every time
you goes in and out,' snarled Crass, 'and you could 'ave put yer tools
on the floor instead of makin' a bench of the dresser.''You can 'ave the bloody place all to yerself in about five minutes,'
replied Bundy, as he assisted to lift a sack of cement weighing about
two hundredweight on to Dawson's back.When they had cleared away all the dirt and fragments of bricks and
mortar, while Crass and Slyme proceeded with the painting, Bundy and
Dawson loaded up their hand-cart with the old range and the bags of
unused cement and plaster, which they took back to the yard.Meantime,
Misery was wandering about the house and gounds like an evil spirit
seeking rest and finding none.He stood for some time gloomily
watching the four gardeners, who were busily at work laying strips of
turf, mowing the lawn, rolling the gravel paths and trimming the trees
and bushes.The boy Bert, Philpot, Harlow, Easton and Sawkins were
loading a hand-cart with ladders and empty paint-pots to return to the
yard.Just as they were setting out, Misery stopped them, remarking
that the cart was not half loaded--he said it would take a month to get
all the stuff away if they went on like that; so by his directions they
placed another long ladder on top of the pile and once more started on
their way, but before they had gone two dozen yards one of the wheels
of the cart collapsed and the load was scattered over the roadway.Bert was at the same side of the cart as the wheel that broke and he
was thrown violently to the ground, where he lay half stunned, in the
midst of the ladders and planks.When they got him out they were
astonished to find that, thanks to the special Providence that watches
over all small boys, he was almost unhurt--just a little dazed, that
was all; and by the time Sawkins returned with another cart, Bert was
able to help to gather up the fallen paint-pots and to accompany the
men with the load to the yard.At the corner of the road they paused
to take a last look at the 'job'.said Harlow, tragically, extending his arm towards
the house.A job that if they'd only have let us do
it properly, couldn't 'ave been done with the number of 'ands we've
'ad, in less than four months; and there it is, finished, messed up,
slobbered over and scamped, in nine weeks!''Yes, and now we can all go to 'ell,' said Philpot, gloomily.At the yard they found Bundy and his mate, Ned Dawson, who helped them
to hang up the ladders in their usual places.Philpot was glad to get
out of assisting to do this, for he had contracted a rather severe
attack of rheumatism when working outside at the 'Cave'.Whilst the
others were putting the ladders away he assisted Bert to carry the
paint-pots and buckets into the paint shop, and while there he filled a
small medicine bottle he had brought with him for the purpose, with
turpentine from the tank.He wanted this stuff to rub into his
shoulders and legs, and as he secreted the bottle in the inner pocket
of his coat, he muttered: 'This is where we gets some of our own back.'They took the key of the yard to the office and as they separated to go
home Bundy suggested that the best thing they could do would be to sew
their bloody mouths up for a few months, because there was not much
probability of their getting another job until about March.The next morning while Crass and Slyme were finishing inside, Owen
wrote the two gates.On the front entrance 'The Cave' and on the back
'Tradesmens Entrance', in gilded letters.In the meantime, Sawkins and
Bert made several journeys to the Yard with the hand-cart.Crass--working in the kitchen with Slyme--was very silent and
thoughtful.Ever since the job was started, every time Mr Sweater had
visited the house to see what progress was being made, Crass had been
grovelling to him in the hope of receiving a tip when the work was
finished.He had been very careful to act upon any suggestions that
Sweater had made from time to time and on several occasions had taken a
lot of trouble to get just the right tints of certain colours, making
up a number of different shades and combinations, and doing parts of
the skirtings or mouldings of rooms in order that Mr Sweater might see
exactly--before they went on with it--what it would look like when
finished.He made a great pretence of deferring to Sweater's opinion,
and assured him that he did not care how much trouble he took as long
as he--Sweater--was pleased.In fact, it was no trouble at all: it was
a pleasure.As the work neared completion, Crass began to speculate
upon the probable amount of the donation he would receive as the reward
of nine weeks of cringing, fawning, abject servility.He thought it
quite possible that he might get a quid: it would not be too much,
considering all the trouble he had taken.At
any rate, he felt certain that he was sure to get ten bob; a gentleman
like Mr Sweater would never have the cheek to offer less.The more he
thought about it the more improbable it appeared that the amount would
be less than a quid, and he made up his mind that whatever he got he
would take good care that none of the other men knew anything about it.HE was the one who had had all the worry of the job, and he was the
only one entitled to anything there was to be had.Besides, even if he
got a quid, by the time you divided that up amongst a dozen--or even
amongst two or three--it would not be worth having.At about eleven o'clock Mr Sweater arrived and began to walk over the
house, followed by Crass, who carried a pot of paint and a small brush
and made believe to be 'touching up' and finishing off parts of the
work.As Sweater went from one room to another Crass repeatedly placed
himself in the way in the hope of being spoken to, but Sweater took no
notice of him whatever.Once or twice Crass's heart began to beat
quickly as he furtively watched the great man and saw him thrust his
thumb and finger into his waistcoat pocket, but on each occasion
Sweater withdrew his hand with nothing in it.After a while, observing
that the gentleman was about to depart without having spoken, Crass
determined to break the ice himself.'It's a little better weather we're 'avin' now, sir.''I was beginnin' to be afraid as I shouldn't be hable to git
heverything finished in time for you to move in before Christmas, sir,'
Crass continued, 'but it's hall done now, sir.''I've kept the fire agoin' in hall the rooms has you told me, sir,'
resumed Crass after a pause.'I think you'll find as the place is nice
and dry, sir; the honly places as is a bit damp is the kitchen and
scullery and the other rooms in the basement, sir, but of course that's
nearly halways the case, sir, when the rooms is partly hunderground,
sir.'But of course it don't matter so much about the basement, sir, because
it's honly the servants what 'as to use it, sir, and even down there
it'll be hall right hin the summer, sir.'One would scarcely think, from the contemptuous way in which he spoke
of'servants' that Crass's own daughter was 'in service', but such was
the case.'Oh, yes, there's no doubt about that,' replied Sweater as he moved
towards the door; 'there's no doubt it will be dry enough in the
summer.'Good morning to YOU, sir,' said Crass, following him.'I 'opes as
you're pleased with all the work, sir; everything satisfactory, sir.'I think it looks very nice; very nice indeed; I'm very
pleased with it,' said Sweater affably.'Good morning, sir,' replied the foreman with a sickly smile as Sweater
departed.When the other was gone, Crass sat down dejectedly on the bottom step
of the stairs, overwhelmed with the ruin of his hopes and expectations.He tried to comfort himself with the reflection that all hope was not
lost, because he would have to come to the house again on Monday and
Tuesday to fix the venetian blinds; but all the same he could not help
thinking that it was only a very faint hope, for he felt that if
Sweater had intended giving anything he would have done so today; and
it was very improbable that he would see Sweater on Monday or Tuesday
at all, for the latter did not usually visit the job in the early part
of the week.However, Crass made up his mind to hope for the best,
and, pulling himself together, he presently returned to the kitchen,
where he found Slyme and Sawkins waiting for him.He had not mentioned
his hopes of a tip to either of them, but they did not need any telling
and they were both determined to have their share of whatever he got.demanded Sawkins, going straight to the point.Slyme laughed in a sneering, incredulous way, but Sawkins was inclined
to be abusive.He averred that he had been watching Crass and Sweater
and had seen the latter put his thumb and finger into his waistcoat
pocket as he walked into the dining-room, followed by Crass.It took
the latter a long time to convince his two workmates of the truth of
his own account, but he succeeded at last, and they all three agreed
that Old Sweater was a sanguinary rotter, and they lamented over the
decay of the good old-fashioned customs.'Why, at one time o' day,' said Crass, 'only a few years ago, if you
went to a gentleman's 'ouse to paint one or two rooms you could always
be sure of a bob or two when you'd finished.'By half past twelve everything was squared up, and, having loaded up
the hand-cart with all that remained of the materials, dirty paint-pots
and plant, they all set out together for the yard, to put all the
things away before going to the office for their money.Sawkins took
the handle of the cart, Slyme and Crass walked at one side and Owen and
Bert at the other.There was no need to push, for the road was
downhill most of the way; so much so that they had all to help to hold
back the cart, which travelled so rapidly that Bert found it difficult
to keep pace with the others and frequently broke into a trot to
recover lost ground, and Crass--being fleshy and bloated with beer,
besides being unused to much exertion--began to perspire and soon
appealed to the others not to let it go so fast--there was no need to
get done before one o'clock.Chapter 27

The March of the Imperialists


It was an unusually fine day for the time of year, and as they passed
along the Grand Parade--which faced due south--they felt quite warm.The Parade was crowded with richly dressed and bejewelled loafers,
whose countenances in many instances bore unmistakable signs of
drunkenness and gluttony.Some of the females had tried to conceal the
ravages of vice and dissipation by coating their faces with powder and
paint.Mingling with and part of this crowd were a number of
well-fed-looking individuals dressed in long garments of black cloth of
the finest texture, and broad-brimmed soft felt hats.Most of these
persons had gold rings on their soft white fingers and glove-like kid
or calfskin boots on their feet.They belonged to the great army of
imposters who obtain an easy living by taking advantage of the
ignorance and simplicity of their fellow-men, and pretending to be the
'followers' and'servants' of the lowly Carpenter of Nazareth--the Man
of Sorrows, who had not where to lay His head.None of these black-garbed 'disciples' were associating with the groups
of unemployed carpenters, bricklayers, plasterers, and painters who
stood here and there in the carriage-way dressed in mean and shabby
clothing and with faces pale with privation.Many of these latter were
known to our friends with the cart, and nodded to them as they passed.Now and then some of them came over and walked a little distance by
their side, inquiring whether there was any news of another job at
Rushton's.When they were about half-way down the Parade, just near the Fountain,
Crass and his mates encountered a number of men on whose arms were
white bands with the word 'Collector' in black letters.They carried
collecting boxes and accosted the people in the street, begging for
money for the unemployed.These men were a kind of skirmishers for the
main body, which could be seen some distance behind.As the procession drew near, Sawkins steered the cart into the kerb and
halted as they went past.There were about three hundred men
altogether, marching four abreast.They carried three large white
banners with black letters, 'Thanks to our Subscribers' 'In aid of
Genuine Unemployed', 'The Children must be Fed'.Although there were a
number of artisans in the procession, the majority of the men belonged
to what is called the unskilled labourer class.The skilled artisan
does not as a rule take part in such a procession except as a very last
resource...  And all the time he strives to keep up an appearance of
being well-to-do, and would be highly indignant if anyone suggested
that he was really in a condition of abject, miserable poverty.Although he knows that his children are often not so well fed as are
the pet dogs and cats of his 'betters', he tries to bluff his
neighbours into thinking that he has some mysterious private means of
which they know nothing, and conceals his poverty as if it were a
crime.Most of this class of men would rather starve than beg.Consequently not more than a quarter of the men in the procession were
skilled artisans; the majority were labourers.There was also a sprinkling of those unfortunate outcasts of
society--tramps and destitute, drunken loafers.If the self-righteous
hypocrites who despise these poor wretches had been subjected to the
same conditions, the majority of them would inevitably have become the
same as these.Haggard and pale, shabbily or raggedly dressed, their boots broken and
down at heel, they slouched past.Some of them stared about with a
dazed or half-wild expression, but most of them walked with downcast
eyes or staring blankly straight in front of them.They appeared
utterly broken-spirited, hopeless and ashamed...

'Anyone can see what THEY are,' sneered Crass, 'there isn't fifty
genuine tradesmen in the whole crowd, and most of 'em wouldn't work if
they 'ad the offer of it.''That's just what I was thinkin',' agreed Sawkins with a laugh.'There will be plenty of time to say that when they have been offered
work and have refused to do it,' said Owen.'This sort of thing does the town a lot of 'arm,' remarked Slyme; 'it
oughtn't to be allowed; the police ought to stop it.It's enough to
drive all the gentry out of the place!''Bloody disgraceful, I call it,' said Crass,'marchin' along the Grand
Parade on a beautiful day like this, just at the very time when most of
the gentry is out enjoyin' the fresh hair.''I suppose you think they ought to stay at home and starve quietly,'
said Owen.'I don't see why these men should care what harm they do to
the town; the town doesn't seem to care much what becomes of THEM.''Do you believe in this sort of thing, then?'I don't believe in begging as a favour for what
one is entitled to demand as a right from the thieves who have robbed
them and who are now enjoying the fruits of their labour.From the
look of shame on their faces you might think that they were the
criminals instead of being the victims.''Well you must admit that most of them is very inferior men,' said
Crass with a self-satisfied air.'There's very few mechanics amongst
em.''They're human beings, and they have as much right to live as
anyone else.What is called unskilled labour is just as necessary and
useful as yours or mine.I am no more capable of doing the "unskilled"
labour that most of these men do than most of them would be capable of
doing my work.''Well, if they was skilled tradesmen, they might find it easier to get
a job,' said Crass.'Do you mean to say you think that if all these men could be
transformed into skilled carpenters, plasterers, bricklayers, and
painters, that it would be easier for all those other chaps whom we
passed a little while ago to get work?Is it possible that you or any
other sane man can believe anything so silly as that?''If there is not enough work to employ all the mechanics whom we see
standing idle about the streets, how would it help these labourers in
the procession if they could all become skilled workmen?'Still Crass did not answer, and neither Slyme nor Sawkins came to his
assistance.'If that could be done,' continued Owen, 'it would simply make things
worse for those who are already skilled mechanics.A greater number of
skilled workers--keener competition for skilled workmen's jobs--a
larger number of mechanics out of employment, and consequently,
improved opportunities for employers to reduce wages.That is probably
the reason why the Liberal Party--which consists for the most part of
exploiters of labour--procured the great Jim Scalds to tell us that
improved technical education is the remedy for unemployment and
poverty.''I suppose you think Jim Scalds is a bloody fool, the same as everybody
else what don't see things YOUR way?''I should think he was a fool if I thought he believed what he says.He says it because he thinks the
majority of the working classes are such fools that they will believe
him.If he didn't think that most of us are fools he wouldn't tell us
such a yarn as that.''And I suppose you think as 'is opinion ain't far wrong,' snarled Crass.'We shall be better able to judge of that after the next General
Election,' replied Owen.'If the working classes again elect a
majority of Liberal or Tory landlords and employers to rule over them,
it will prove that Jim Scalds' estimate of their intelligence is about
right.''Well, anyhow,' persisted Slyme, 'I don't think it's a right thing that
they should be allowed to go marchin' about like that--driving visitors
out of the town.''What do you think they ought to do, then?''Let the b--rs go to the bloody workhouse!''But before they could be received there they would have to be
absolutely homeless and destitute, and then the ratepayers would have
to keep them.It costs about twelve shillings a week for each inmate,
so it seems to me that it would be more sensible and economical for the
community to employ them on some productive work.'They had by this time arrived at the yard.The steps and ladders were
put away in their places and the dirty paint-pots and pails were placed
in the paint-shop on the bench and on the floor.With what had
previously been brought back there were a great many of these things,
all needing to be cleaned out, so Bert at any rate stood in no danger
of being out of employment for some time to come.When they were paid at the office, Owen on opening his envelope found
it contained as usual, a time sheet for the next week, which meant that
he was not'stood off' although he did not know what work there would
be to do.Crass and Slyme were both to go to the 'Cave' to fix the
venetian blinds, and Sawkins also was to come to work as usual.Chapter 28

The Week before Christmas


During the next week Owen painted a sign on the outer wall of one of
the workshops at the yard, and he also wrote the name of the firm on
three of the handcarts.These and other odd jobs kept him employed a few hours every day, so
that he was not actually out of work.One afternoon--there being nothing to do--he went home at three
o'clock, but almost as soon as he reached the house Bert White came
with a coffin-plate which had to be written at once.The lad said he
had been instructed to wait for it.Nora gave the boy some tea and bread and butter to eat whilst Owen was
doing the coffin-plate, and presently Frankie--who had been playing out
in the street--made his appearance.The two boys were already known to
each other, for Bert had been there several times before--on errands
similar to the present one, or to take lessons on graining and
letter-painting from Owen.'I'm going to have a party next Monday--after Christmas,' remarked
Frankie.'Mother told me I might ask you if you'll come?''All right,' said Bert; 'and I'll bring my Pandoramer.'No, of course not,' replied Bert with a superior air.'It's a
show, like they have at the Hippodrome or the Circus.''Not very big: it's made out of a sugar-box.It's
not quite finished yet, but I shall get it done this week.There's a
band as well, you know.'This' was a large mouth organ which he produced from the inner pocket
of his coat.Bert accordingly played, and Frankie sang at the top of his voice a
selection of popular songs, including 'The Old Bull and Bush', 'Has
Anyone seen a German Band?', 'Waiting at the Church' and
finally--possibly as a dirge for the individual whose coffin-plate Owen
was writing--'Goodbye, Mignonette' and 'I wouldn't leave my little
wooden hut for you'.'You don't know what's in that,' said Frankie, referring to a large
earthenware bread-pan which Nora had just asked Owen to help her to
lift from the floor on to one of the chairs.The vessel in question
was covered with a clean white cloth.'We got the things out of
the Christmas Club on Saturday.We've been paying in ever since last
Christmas.We're going to mix it now, and you can have a stir too if
you like, for luck.'Whilst they were stirring the pudding, Frankie several times requested
the others to feel his muscle: he said he felt sure that he would soon
be strong enough to go out to work, and he explained to Bert that the
extraordinary strength he possessed was to be attributed to the fact
that he lived almost exclusively on porridge and milk.For the rest of the week, Owen continued to work down at the yard with
Sawkins, Crass, and Slyme, painting some of the ladders, steps and
other plant belonging to the firm.These things had to have two coats
of paint and the name Rushton & Co.As soon as they
had got some of them second-coated, Owen went on with the writing,
leaving the painting for the others, so as to share the work as fairly
as possible.Several times during the week one or other of them was
taken away to do some other work; once Crass and Slyme had to go and
wash off and whiten a ceiling somewhere, and several times Sawkins was
sent out to assist the plumbers.Every day some of the men who had been'stood off' called at the yard
to ask if any other 'jobs' had 'come in'.From these callers they
heard all the news.Old Jack Linden had not succeeded in getting
anything to do at the trade since he was discharged from Rushton's, and
it was reported that he was trying to earn a little money by hawking
bloaters from house to house.As for Philpot, he said that he had been
round to nearly all the firms in the town and none of them had any work
to speak of.Newman--the man whom the reader will remember was sacked for taking too
much pains with his work--had been arrested and sentenced to a month's
imprisonment because he had not been able to pay his poor rates, and
the Board of Guardians were allowing his wife three shillings a week to
maintain herself and the three children.Philpot had been to see them,
and she told him that the landlord was threatening to turn them into
the street; he would have seized their furniture and sold it if it had
been worth the expense of the doing.'I feel ashamed of meself,' Philpot added in confidence to Owen, 'when
I think of all the money I chuck away on beer.If it wasn't for that,
I shouldn't be in such a hole meself now, and I might be able to lend
'em a 'elpin' 'and.''It ain't so much that I likes the beer, you know,' he continued; 'it's
the company.When you ain't got no 'ome, in a manner o' speakin', like
me, the pub's about the only place where you can get a little
enjoyment.But you ain't very welcome there unless you spends your
money.''Is the three shillings all they have to live on?''I think she goes out charin' when she can get it,' replied Philpot,
'but I don't see as she can do a great deal o' that with three young
'uns to look after, and from what I hear of it she's only just got over
a illness and ain't fit to do much.''I'll tell you what,' said Philpot.'I've been thinking we might get
up a bit of a subscription for 'em.There's several chaps in work what
knows Newman, and if they was each to give a trifle we could get enough
to pay for a Christmas dinner, anyway.I've brought a sheet of
foolscap with me, and I was goin' to ask you to write out the heading
for me.'As there was no pen available at the workshop, Philpot waited till four
o'clock and then accompanied Owen home, where the heading of the list
was written.Owen put his name down for a shilling and Philpot his for
a similar amount.Philpot stayed to tea and accepted an invitation to spend Christmas Day
with them, and to come to Frankie's party on the Monday after.The next morning Philpot brought the list to the yard and Crass and
Slyme put their names down for a shilling each, and Sawkins for
threepence, it being arranged that the money was to be paid on
payday--Christmas Eve.In the meantime, Philpot was to see as many as
he could of those who were in work, at other firms and get as many
subscriptions as possible.At pay-time on Christmas Eve Philpot turned up with the list and Owen
and the others paid him the amounts they had put their names down for.From other men he had succeeded in obtaining nine and sixpence, mostly
in sixpences and threepences.Some of this money he had already
received, but for the most part he had made appointments with the
subscribers to call at their homes that evening.It was decided that
Owen should accompany him and also go with him to hand over the money
to Mrs Newman.It took them nearly three hours to get in all the money, for the places
they had to go to were in different localities, and in one or two cases
they had to wait because their man had not yet come home, and sometimes
it was not possible to get away without wasting a little time in talk.In three instances those who had put their names down for threepence
increased the amount to sixpence and one who had promised sixpence gave
a shilling.There were two items of threepence each which they did not
get at all, the individuals who had put their names down having gone
upon the drunk.Another cause of delay was that they met or called on
several other men who had not yet been asked for a subscription, and
there were several others--including some members of the Painters
Society whom Owen had spoken to during the week--who had promised him
to give a subscription.In the end they succeeded in increasing the
total amount to nineteen and ninepence, and they then put
three-halfpence each to make it up to a pound.The Newmans lived in a small house the rent of which was six shillings
per week and taxes.To reach the house one had to go down a dark and
narrow passage between two shops, the house being in a kind of well,
surrounded by the high walls of the back parts of larger
buildings--chiefly business premises and offices.The air did not
circulate very freely in this place, and the rays of the sun never
reached it.In the summer the atmosphere was close and foul with the
various odours which came from the back-yards of the adjoining
buildings, and in the winter it was dark and damp and gloomy, a
culture-ground for bacteria and microbes.The majority of those who
profess to be desirous of preventing and curing the disease called
consumption must be either hypocrites or fools, for they ridicule the
suggestion that it is necessary first to cure and prevent the poverty
that compels badly clothed and half-starved human beings to sleep in
such dens as this.The front door opened into the living-room or, rather, kitchen, which
was dimly lighted by a small paraffin lamp on the table, where were
also some tea-cups and saucers, each of a different pattern, and the
remains of a loaf of bread.The wallpaper was old and discoloured; a
few almanacs and unframed prints were fixed to the walls, and on the
mantelshelf were some cracked and worthless vases and ornaments.At
one time they had possessed a clock and an overmantel and some framed
pictures, but they had all been sold to obtain money to buy food.Nearly everything of any value had been parted with for the same
reason--the furniture, the pictures, the bedclothes, the carpet and the
oilcloth, piece by piece, nearly everything that had once constituted
the home--had been either pawned or sold to buy food or to pay rent
during the times when Newman was out of work--periods that had recurred
during the last few years with constantly increasing frequency and
duration.Now there was nothing left but these few old broken chairs
and the deal table which no one would buy; and upstairs, the wretched
bedsteads and mattresses whereon they slept at night, covering
themselves with worn-out remnants of blankets and the clothes they wore
during the day.In answer to Philpot's knock, the door was opened by a little girl
about seven years old, who at once recognized Philpot, and called out
his name to her mother, and the latter came also to the door, closely
followed by two other children, a little, fragile-looking girl about
three, and a boy about five years of age, who held on to her skirt and
peered curiously at the visitors.Mrs Newman was about thirty, and her
appearance confirmed the statement of Philpot that she had only just
recovered from an illness; she was very white and thin and
dejected-looking.When Philpot explained the object of their visit and
handed her the money, the poor woman burst into tears, and the two
smaller children--thinking that this piece of paper betokened some
fresh calamity--began to cry also.They remembered that all their
troubles had been preceded by the visits of men who brought pieces of
paper, and it was rather difficult to reassure them.That evening, after Frankie was asleep, Owen and Nora went out to do
their Christmas marketing.They had not much money to spend, for Owen
had brought home only seventeen shillings.He had worked thirty-three
hours--that came to nineteen and threepence--one shilling and
threehalfpence had gone on the subscription list, and he had given the
rest of the coppers to a ragged wreck of a man who was singing a hymn
in the street.The other shilling had been deducted from his wages in
repayment of a'sub' he had had during the week.There was a great deal to be done with this seventeen shillings.First
of all there was the rent--seven shillings--that left ten.Then there
was the week's bread bill--one and threepence.They had a pint of milk
every day, chiefly for the boy's sake--that came to one and two.Then
there was one and eight for a hundredweight of coal that had been
bought on credit.Fortunately, there were no groceries to buy, for the
things they had obtained with their Christmas Club money would be more
than sufficient for the ensuing week.Frankie's stockings were all broken and beyond mending, so it was
positively necessary to buy him another pair for fivepence
three-farthings.These stockings were not much good--a pair at double
the price would have been much cheaper, for they would have lasted
three or four times longer; but they could not afford to buy the dearer
kind.It was just the same with the coal: if they had been able to
afford it, they could have bought a ton of the same class of coal for
twenty-six shillings, but buying it as they did, by the hundredweight,
they had to pay at the rate of thirty-three shillings and fourpence a
ton.It was just the same with nearly everything else.This is how
the working classes are robbed.Although their incomes are the lowest,
they are compelled to buy the most expensive articles--that is, the
lowest-priced articles.Everybody knows that good clothes, boots or
furniture are really the cheapest in the end, although they cost more
money at first; but the working classes can seldom or never afford to
buy good things; they have to buy cheap rubbish which is dear at any
price.Six weeks previously Owen bought a pair of second-hand boots for three
shillings and they were now literally falling to pieces.Nora's shoes
were in much the same condition, but, as she said, it did not matter so
much about hers because there was no need for her to go out if the
weather were not fine.In addition to the articles already mentioned, they had to spend
fourpence for half a gallon of paraffin oil, and to put sixpence into
the slot of the gas-stove.This reduced the money to five and
sevenpence farthing, and of this it was necessary to spend a shilling
on potatoes and other vegetables.They both needed some new underclothing, for what they had was so old
and worn that it was quite useless for the purpose it was supposed to
serve; but there was no use thinking of these things, for they had now
only four shillings and sevenpence farthing left, and all that would be
needed for toys.They had to buy something special for Frankie for
Christmas, and it would also be necessary to buy something for each of
the children who were coming to the party on the following Monday.Fortunately, there was no meat to buy, for Nora had been paying into
the Christmas Club at the butcher's as well as at the grocer's.They stopped to look at the display of toys at Sweater's Emporium.For
several days past Frankie had been talking of the wonders contained in
these windows, so they wished if possible to buy him something here.They recognized many of the things from the description the boy had
given of them, but nearly everything was so dear that for a long time
they looked in vain for something it would be possible to buy.'That's the engine he talks so much about,' said Non, indicating a
model railway locomotive; that one marked five shillings.''It might just as well be marked five pounds as far as we're
concerned,' replied Owen.As they were speaking, one of the salesmen appeared at the back of the
window and, reaching forward, removed the engine.It was probably the
last one of the kind and had evidently just been sold.Owen and Nora
experienced a certain amount of consolation in knowing that even if
they had the money they would not have been able to buy it.After lengthy consideration, they decided on a clockwork engine at a
shilling, but the other toys they resolved to buy at a cheaper shop.Nora went into the Emporium to get the toy and whilst Owen was waiting
for her Mr and Mrs Rushton came out.They did not appear to see Owen,
who observed that the shape of one of several parcels they carried
suggested that it contained the engine that had been taken from the
window a little while before.When Nora returned with her purchase, they went in search of a cheaper
place and after a time they found what they wanted.For sixpence they
bought a cardboard box that had come all the way from Japan and
contained a whole family of dolls--father, mother and four children of
different sizes.A box of paints, threepence: a sixpenny tea service,
a threepenny drawing slate, and a rag doll, sixpence.On their way home they called at a greengrocer's where Owen had ordered
and paid for a small Christmas tree a few weeks before; and as they
were turning the corner of the street where they lived they met Crass,
half-drunk, with a fine fat goose slung over his shoulder by its neck.He greeted Owen jovially and held up the bird for their inspection.'Not a bad tanner's-worth, eh?'I won this and a box of cigars--fifty--for a tanner, and the
other one I got out of the Club at our Church Mission 'all: threepence
a week for twenty-eight weeks; that makes seven bob.But,' he added,
confidentially,''you couldn't buy 'em for that price in a shop, you
know.They costs the committee a good bit more nor that--wholesale;
but we've got some rich gents on our committee and they makes up the
difference,' and with a nod and a cunning leer he lurched off.Frankie was sleeping soundly when they reached home, and so was the
kitten, which was curled up on the quilt on the foot of the bed.After
they had had some supper, although it was after eleven o'clock, Owen
fixed the tree in a large flower-pot that had served a similar purpose
before, and Nora brought out from the place where it had been stored
away since last Christmas a cardboard box containing a lot of
glittering tinsel ornaments--globes of silvered or gilded or painted
glass, birds, butterflies and stars.Some of these things had done
duty three Christmases ago and although they were in some instances
slightly tarnished most of them were as good as new.In addition to
these and the toys they had bought that evening they had a box of
bon-bons and a box of small  wax candles, both of which had
formed part of the things they got from the grocer's with the Christmas
Club money; and there were also a lot of little  paper bags of
sweets, and a number of sugar and chocolate toys and animals which had
been bought two or three at a time for several weeks past and put away
for this occasion.There was something suitable for each child that
was coming, with the exception of Bert White; they had intended to
include a sixpenny pocket knife for him in their purchases that
evening, but as they had not been able to afford this Owen decided to
give him an old set of steel graining combs which he knew the lad had
often longed to possess.The tin case containing these tools was
accordingly wrapped in some red tissue paper and hung on the tree with
the other things.They moved about as quietly as possible so as not to disturb those who
were sleeping in the rooms beneath, because long before they were
finished the people in the other parts of the house had all retired to
rest, and silence had fallen on the deserted streets outside.As they
were putting the final touches to their work the profound stillness of
the night was suddenly broken by the voices of a band of carol-singers.The sound overwhelmed them with memories of other and happier times,
and Nora stretched out her hands impulsively to Owen, who drew her
close to his side.They had been married just over eight years, and although during all
that time they had never been really free from anxiety for the future,
yet on no previous Christmas had they been quite so poor as now.During
the last few years periods of unemployment had gradually become more
frequent and protracted, and the attempt he had made in the early part
of the year to get work elsewhere had only resulted in plunging them
into even greater poverty than before.But all the same there was much
to be thankful for: poor though they were, they were far better off
than many thousands of others: they still had food and shelter, and
they had each other and the boy.Before they went to bed Owen carried the tree into Frankie's bedroom
and placed it so that he would be able to see it in all its glittering
glory as soon as he awoke on Christmas morning.Chapter 29

The Pandorama


Although the party was not supposed to begin till six o'clock, Bert
turned up at half past four, bringing the 'Pandoramer' with him.At about half past five the other guests began to arrive.Elsie and
Charley Linden came first, the girl in a pretty blue frock trimmed with
white lace, and Charley resplendent in a new suit, which, like his
sister's dress, had been made out of somebody's cast-off clothes that
had been given to their mother by a visiting lady.It had taken Mrs
Linden many hours of hard work to contrive these garments; in fact,
more time than the things were worth, for although they looked all
right--especially Elsie's--the stuff was so old that it would not wear
very long: but this was the only way in which she could get clothes for
the children at all: she certainly could not afford to buy them any.So she spent hours and hours making things that she knew would fall to
pieces almost as soon as they were made.After these came Nellie, Rosie and Tommy Newman.These presented a
much less prosperous appearance than the other two.Their mother was
not so skilful at contriving new clothes out of old.Nellie was
wearing a grown-up woman's blouse, and by way of ulster she had on an
old-fashioned jacket of thick cloth with large pearl buttons.This was
also a grown-up woman's garment: it was shaped to fit the figure of a
tall woman with wide shoulders and a small waist; consequently, it did
not fit Nellie to perfection.The waist reached below the poor child's
hips.Tommy was arrayed in the patched remains of what had once been a good
suit of clothes.They had been purchased at a second-hand shop last
summer and had been his 'best' for several months, but they were now
much too small for him.Little Rosie--who was only just over three years old--was better off
than either of the other two, for she had a red cloth dress that fitted
her perfectly: indeed, as the district visitor who gave it to her
mother had remarked, it looked as if it had been made for her.'It's not much to look at,' observed Nellie, referring to her big
jacket, but all the same we was very glad of it when the rain came on.'The coat was so big that by withdrawing her arms from the sleeves and
using it as a cloak or shawl she had managed to make it do for all
three of them.Tommy's boots were so broken that the wet had got in and saturated his
stockings, so Nora made him take them all off and wear some old ones of
Frankie's whilst his own were drying at the fire.Philpot, with two large paper bags full of oranges and nuts, arrived
just as they were sitting down to tea--or rather cocoa--for with the
exception of Bert all the children expressed a preference for the
latter beverage.Bert would have liked to have cocoa also, but hearing
that the grown-ups were going to have tea, he thought it would be more
manly to do the same.This question of having tea or cocoa for tea
became a cause of much uproarious merriment on the part of the
children, who asked each other repeatedly which they liked best, 'tea
tea?'They thought it so funny that they said it over
and over again, screaming with laughter all the while, until Tommy got
a piece of cake stuck in his throat and became nearly black in the
face, and then Philpot had to turn him upside down and punch him in the
back to save him from choking to death.This rather sobered the
others, but for some time afterwards whenever they looked at each other
they began to laugh afresh because they thought it was such a good joke.When they had filled themselves up with the 'cocoa-tea' and cakes and
bread and jam, Elsie Linden and Nellie Newman helped to clear away the
cups and saucers, and then Owen lit the candles on the Christmas tree
and distributed the toys to the children, and a little while afterwards
Philpot--who had got a funny-looking mask out of one of the
bon-bons--started a fine game pretending to be a dreadful wild animal
which he called a Pandroculus, and crawling about on all fours, rolled
his goggle eyes and growled out he must have a little boy or girl to
eat for his supper.He looked so terrible that although they knew it was only a joke they
were almost afraid of him, and ran away laughing and screaming to
shelter themselves behind Nora or Owen; but all the same, whenever
Philpot left off playing, they entreated him to 'be it again', and so
he had to keep on being a Pandroculus, until exhaustion compelled him
to return to his natural form.After this they all sat round the table and had a game of cards;
'Snap', they called it, but nobody paid much attention to the rules of
the game: everyone seemed to think that the principal thing to do was
to kick up as much row as possible.After a while Philpot suggested a
change to 'Beggar my neighbour', and won quite a lot of cards before
they found out that he had hidden all the jacks in the pocket of his
coat, and then they mobbed him for a cheat.He might have been
seriously injured if it had not been for Bert, who created a diversion
by standing on a chair and announcing that he was about to introduce to
their notice 'Bert White's World-famed Pandorama' as exhibited before
all the nobility and crowned heads of Europe, England, Ireland and
Scotland, including North America and Wales.Loud cheers greeted the conclusion of Bert's speech.The box was
placed on the table, which was then moved to the end of the room, and
the chairs were ranged in two rows in front.The 'Pandorama' consisted of a stage-front made of painted cardboard
and fixed on the front of a wooden box about three feet long by two
feet six inches high, and about one foot deep from back to front.The
'Show' was a lot of pictures cut out of illustrated weekly papers and
pasted together, end to end, so as to form a long strip or ribbon.Bert
had  all the pictures with water-colours.Just behind the wings of the stage-front at each end of the box--was an
upright roller, and the long strip of pictures was rolled up on this.The upper ends of the rollers came through the top of the box and had
handles attached to them.When these handles were turned the pictures
passed across the stage, unrolling from one roller and rolling on to
the other, and were illuminated by the light of three candles placed
behind.The idea of constructing this machine had been suggested to Bert by a
panorama entertainment he had been to see some time before.'The Style of the decorations,' he remarked, alluding to the painted
stage-front, 'is Moorish.'He lit the candles at the back of the stage and, having borrowed a
tea-tray from Nora, desired the audience to take their seats.When
they had all done so, he requested Owen to put out the lamp and the
candles on the tree, and then he made another speech, imitating the
manner of the lecturer at the panorama entertainment before mentioned.'Ladies and Gentlemen: with your kind permission I am about to
hinterduce to your notice some pitchers of events in different parts of
the world.As each pitcher appears on the stage I will give a short
explanation of the subject, and afterwards the band will play a
suitable collection of appropriated music, consisting of hymns and all
the latest and most popular songs of the day, and the audience is
kindly requested to join in the chorus.'Our first scene,' continued Bert as he turned the handles and brought
the picture into view,'represents the docks at Southampton; the
magnificent steamer which you see lying alongside the shore is the ship
which is waiting to take us to foreign parts.As we have already paid
our fare, we will now go on board and set sail.'As an accompaniment to this picture Bert played the tune of 'Goodbye,
Dolly, I must leave you', and by the time the audience had  finished
singing the chorus he had rolled on another scene, which depicted a
dreadful storm at sea, with a large ship evidently on the point of
foundering.The waves were running mountains high and the inky clouds
were riven by forked lightning.To increase the terrifying effect,
Bert rattled the tea tray and played 'The Bay of Biscay', and the
children sung the chorus whilst he rolled the next picture into view.This scene showed the streets of a large city; mounted police with
drawn swords were dispersing a crowd: several men had been ridden down
and were being trampled under the hoofs of the horses, and a number of
others were bleeding profusely from wounds on the head and face.'After a rather stormy passage we arrives safely at the beautiful city
of Berlin, in Germany, just in time to see a procession of unemployed
workmen being charged by the military police.This picture is
hintitled "Tariff Reform means Work for All".'As an appropriate musical selection Bert played the tune of a
well-known song, and the children sang the words:

        'To be there!Oh, I knew what it was to be there!And when they tore me clothes,
        Blacked me eyes and broke me nose,
        Then I knew what it was to be there!'During the singing Bert turned the handles backwards and again brought
on the picture of the storm at sea.'As we don't want to get knocked on the 'ed, we clears out of Berlin as
soon as we can--whiles we're safe--and once more embarks on our gallint
ship' and after a few more turns of the 'andle we finds ourselves back
once more in Merry Hingland, where we see the inside of a blacksmith's
shop with a lot of half-starved women making iron chains.They work
seventy hours a week for seven shillings.Our next scene is hintitled
"The Hook and Eye Carders".'Ere we see the inside of a room in
Slumtown, with a mother and three children and the old grandmother
sewin' hooks and eyes on cards to be sold in drapers' shops.It ses
underneath the pitcher that 384 hooks and 384 eyes has to be joined
together and sewed on cards for one penny.'While this picture was being rolled away the band played and the
children sang with great enthusiasm:

        'Rule, Brittania, Brittania rules the waves!Britons, never, never, never shall be slaves!''Our next picture is called "An Englishman's Home".'Ere we see the
inside of another room in Slumtown, with the father and mother and four
children sitting down to dinner--bread and drippin' and tea.It ses
underneath the pitcher that there's Thirteen millions of people in
England always on the verge of starvation.These people that you see
in the pitcher might be able to get a better dinner than this if it
wasn't that most of the money wot the bloke earns 'as to pay the rent.Again we turns the 'andle and presently we comes to another very
beautiful scene--"Early Morning in Trafalgar Square".'Ere we see a
lot of Englishmen who have been sleepin' out all night because they
ain't got no 'omes to go to.'As a suitable selection for this picture, Bert played the tune of a
music-hall song, the words of which were familiar to all the
youngsters, who sang at the top of their voices:

        'I live in Trafalgar Square,
        With four lions to guard me,
        Pictures and statues all over the place,
        Lord Nelson staring me straight in the face,
        Of course it's rather draughty,
        But still I'm sure you'll agree,
        If it's good enough for Lord Nelson,
        It's quite good enough for me.''Next we 'ave a view of the dining-hall at the Topside Hotel in London,
where we see the tables set for a millionaires' banquet.The forks and
spoons is made of solid gold and the plates is made of silver.The
flowers that you see on the tables and 'angin' down from the ceilin'
and on the walls is worth L2,000 and it cost the bloke wot give the
supper over L30,000 for this one beano.A few more turns of the 'andle
shows us another glorious banquet--the King of Rhineland being
entertained by the people of England.Next we finds ourselves looking
on at the Lord Mayor's supper at the Mansion House.All the fat men
that you see sittin' at the tables is Liberal and Tory Members of
Parlimint.After this we 'ave a very beautiful pitcher hintitled "Four
footed Haristocrats".'Ere you see Lady Slumrent's pet dogs sittin' up
on chairs at their dinner table with white linen napkins tied round
their necks, eatin' orf silver plates like human people and being
waited on by real live waiters in hevening dress.Lady Slumrent is
very fond of her pretty pets and she does not allow them to be fed on
anything but the very best food; they gets chicken, rump steak, mutton
chops, rice pudding, jelly and custard.''I wished I was a pet dog, don't you?'remarked Tommy Newman to Charley
Linden.'Here we see another unemployed procession,' continued Bert as he
rolled another picture into sight; '2,000 able-bodied men who are not
allowed to work.Next we see the hinterior of a Hindustrial
'Ome--Blind children and <DW36>s working for their living.Our next
scene is called "Cheap Labour".'Ere we see a lot of small boys about
twelve and thirteen years old bein' served out with their Labour
Stifficats, which gives 'em the right to go to work and earn money to
help their unemployed fathers to pay the slum rent.'Once more we turns the 'andle and brings on one of our finest scenes.This lovely pitcher is hintitled "The Hangel of Charity", and shows us
the beautiful Lady Slumrent seated at the table in a cosy corner of 'er
charmin' boodore, writin' out a little cheque for the relief of the
poor of Slumtown.'Our next scene is called "The Rival Candidates, or, a Scene during the
General Election".On the left you will observe, standin' up in a
motor car, a swell bloke with a eyeglass stuck in one eye, and a
overcoat with a big fur collar and cuffs, addressing the crowd: this is
the Honourable Augustus Slumrent, the Conservative candidate.On the
other side of the road we see another motor car and another swell bloke
with a round pane of glass in one eye and a overcoat with a big fur
collar and cuffs, standing up in the car and addressin' the crowd.This
is Mr Mandriver, the Liberal candidate.The crowds of shabby-lookin'
chaps standin' round the motor cars wavin' their 'ats and cheerin' is
workin' men.Both the candidates is tellin' 'em the same old story,
and each of 'em is askin' the workin' men to elect 'im to Parlimint,
and promisin' to do something or other to make things better for the
lower horders.'As an appropriate selection to go with this picture, Bert played the
tune of a popular song, the words being well known to the children, who
sang enthusiastically, clapping their hands and stamping their feet on
the floor in time with the music:

        'We've both been there before,
        Many a time, many a time!We've both been there before,
        Many a time!To colour his nose and mine,
        We've both been there before,
        Many a time, many a time!'At the conclusion of the singing, Bert turned another picture into view.''Ere we 'ave another election scene.At each side we see the two
candidates the same as in the last pitcher.In the middle of the road
we see a man lying on the ground, covered with blood, with a lot of
Liberal and Tory working men kickin' 'im, jumpin' on 'im, and stampin'
on 'is face with their 'obnailed boots.The bloke on the ground is a
Socialist, and the reason why they're kickin' 'is face in is because 'e
said that the only difference between Slumrent and Mandriver was that
they was both alike.'While the audience were admiring this picture, Bert played another
well-known tune, and the children sang the words:

        'Two lovely black eyes,
        Oh what a surprise!Only for telling a man he was wrong,
        Two lovely black eyes.'Bert continued to turn the handles of the rollers and a long succession
of pictures passed across the stage, to the delight of the children,
who cheered and sang as occasion demanded, but the most enthusiastic
outburst of all greeted the appearance of the final picture, which was
a portrait of the King.Directly the children saw it--without waiting
for the band--they gave three cheers and began to sing the chorus of
the National Anthem.A round of applause for Bert concluded the Pandorama performance; the
lamp and the candles of the Christmas tree were relit--for although all
the toys had been taken off, the tree still made a fine show with the
shining glass ornaments--and then they had some more games; blind man's
buff, a tug-of-war--in which Philpot was defeated with great
laughter--and a lot of other games.And when they were tired of these,
each child'said a piece' or sung a song, learnt specially for the
occasion.The only one who had not come prepared in this respect was
little Rosie, and even she--so as to be the same as the
others--insisted on reciting the only piece she knew.Kneeling on the
hearthrug, she put her hands together, palm to palm, and shutting her
eyes very tightly she repeated the verse she always said every night
before going to bed:

        'Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,
        Look on me, a little child.Pity my simplicity,
        Suffer me to come to Thee.'Then she stood up and kissed everyone in turn, and Philpot crossed over
and began looking out of the window, and coughed, and blew his nose,
because a nut that he had been eating had gone down the wrong way.Most of them were by this time quite tired out, so after some supper
the party broke up.Although they were nearly all very sleepy, none of
them were very willing to go, but they were consoled by the thought of
another entertainment to which they were going later on in the
week--the Band of Hope Tea and Prize Distribution at the Shining Light
Chapel.Bert undertook to see Elsie and Charley safely home, and Philpot
volunteered to accompany Nellie and Tommy Newman, and to carry Rosie,
who was so tired that she fell asleep on his shoulder before they left
the house.As they were going down the stairs Frankie held a hurried consultation
with his mother, with the result that he was able to shout after them
an invitation to come again next Christmas.Chapter 30

The Brigands hold a Council of War


It being now what is usually called the festive season--possibly
because at this period of the year a greater number of people are
suffering from hunger and cold than at any other time--the reader will
not be surprised at being invited to another little party which took
place on the day after the one we have just left.The scene was Mr
Sweater's office.Mr Sweater was seated at his desk, but with his
chair swung round to enable him to face his guests--Messrs Rushton,
Didlum, and Grinder, who were also seated.'Something will 'ave to be done, and that very soon,' Grinder was
saying.'We can't go on much longer as we're doing at present.For my
part, I think the best thing to do is to chuck up the sponge at once;
the company is practically bankrupt now, and the longer we waits the
worser it will be.''That's just my opinion,' said Didlum dejectedly.'If we could supply
the electric light at the same price as gas, or a little cheaper, we
might have some chance; but we can't do it.The fact is that the
machinery we've got is no dam good; it's too small and it's wore out,
consequently the light we supply is inferior to gas and costs more.''Yes, I think we're fairly beaten this time,' said Rushton.'Why, even
if the Gas Coy hadn't moved their works beyond the borough boundary,
still we shouldn't 'ave been hable to compete with 'em.''The truth of the matter is just wot
Didlum says.Our machinery is too small, it's worn hout, and good for
nothing but to be throwed on the scrap-heap.So there's only one thing
left to do and that is--go into liquidation.''I don't see it,' remarked Sweater.'Well, what do you propose, then?'Pull down the works and
build fresh, and buy some new machinery?And then most likely not make
a do of it after all?You
won't catch me chuckin' good money after bad in that way.'remarked Didlum, very decidedly.'I'm not such a fool as to suggest anything
of that sort,' he said.'You seem to forget that I am one of the
largest shareholders myself.replied Grinder with a contemptuous laugh in which the
others joined.'Who's going to buy the shares of a concern that's
practically bankrupt and never paid a dividend?''I've tried to sell my little lot several times already,' said Didlum
with a sickly smile, 'but nobody won't buy 'em.'repeated Sweater, replying to Grinder.Why shouldn't Mugsborough go
in for Socialism as well as other towns?'Rushton, Didlum and Grinder fairly gasped for breath: the audacity of
the chief's proposal nearly paralysed them.'I'm afraid we should never git away with it,' ejaculated Didlum, as
soon as he could speak.'When the people tumbled to it, there'd be no
hend of a row.''The majority of the
people will never know anything about it!Listen to me--'

'Are you quite sure as we can't be over'eard?'interrupted Rushton,
glancing nervously at the door and round the office.'It's all right,' answered Sweater, who nevertheless lowered his voice
almost to a whisper, and the others drew their chairs closer and bent
forward to listen.'You know we still have a little money in hand: well, what I propose is
this: At the annual meeting, which, as you know, comes off next week,
we'll arrange for the Secretary to read a highly satisfactory report,
and we'll declare a dividend of 15 per cent--we can arrange it somehow
between us.Of course, we'll have to cook the accounts a little, but
I'll see that it's done properly.The other shareholders are not going
to ask any awkward questions, and we all understand each other.'Sweater paused, and regarded the other three brigands intently.'Yes, yes,' said Didlum eagerly.And Rushton and
Grinder nodded assent.'Afterwards,' resumed Sweater, 'I'll arrange for a good report of the
meeting to appear in the Weekly Ananias.I'll instruct the Editor to
write it himself, and I'll tell him just what to say.I'll also get
him to write a leading article about it, saying that electricity is
sure to supersede gas for lighting purposes in the very near future.Then the article will go on to refer to the huge profits made by the
Gas Coy and to say how much better it would have been if the town had
bought the gasworks years ago, so that those profits might have been
used to reduce the rates, the same as has been done in other towns.Finally, the article will declare that it's a great pity that the
Electric Light Supply should be in the hands of a private company, and
to suggest that an effort be made to acquire it for the town.'In the meantime we can all go about--in a very quiet and judicious
way, of course--bragging about what a good thing we've got, and saying
we don't mean to sell.We shall say that we've overcome all the
initial expenses and difficulties connected with the installation of
the works--that we are only just beginning to reap the reward of our
industry and enterprise, and so on.'Then,' continued the Chief, 'we can arrange for it to be proposed in
the Council that the Town should purchase the Electric Light Works.''But not by one of us four, you know,' said Grinder with a cunning leer.'Certainly not; that would give the show away at once.There are, as
you know--several members of the Band who are not shareholders in the
company; we'll get some of them to do most of the talking.We, being
the directors of the company, must pretend to be against selling, and
stick out for our own price; and when we do finally consent we must
make out that we are sacrificing our private interests for the good of
the Town.We'll get a committee appointed--we'll have an expert
engineer down from London--I know a man that will suit our purpose
admirably--we'll pay him a trifle and he'll say whatever we tell him
to--and we'll rush the whole business through before you can say "Jack
Robinson", and before the rate-payers have time to realize what's being
done.Not that we need worry ourselves much about them.Most of them
take no interest in public affairs, but even if there is something
said, it won't matter much to us once we've got the money.It'll be a
nine days' wonder and then we'll hear no more of it.'As the Chief ceased speaking, the other brigands also remained silent,
speechless with admiration of his cleverness.'Well, what do you think of it?''I think it's
splendid!If we can honly git away with it,
I reckon it'll be one of the smartest thing we've ever done.''Smart ain't the word for it,' observed Rushton.'There's no doubt it's a grand idear!'exclaimed Didlum, 'and I've just
thought of something else that might be done to help it along.We could
arrange to 'ave a lot of letters sent "To the Editor of the Obscurer"
and "To the Editor of the Ananias," and "To the Editor of the Weekly
Chloroform" in favour of the scheme.''Yes, that's a very good idea,' said Grinder.'For that matter the
editors could write them to themselves and sign them "Progress",
"Ratepayer", "Advance Mugsborough", and sich-like.''Yes, that's all right,' said the Chief, thoughtfully, 'but we must be
careful not to overdo it; of course there will have to be a certain
amount of publicity, but we don't want to create too much interest in
it.''Come to think of it,' observed Rushton arrogantly, 'why should we
trouble ourselves about the opinion of the ratepayers at all?Why
should we trouble to fake the books, or declare a dividend or 'ave the
harticles in the papers or anything else?We've got the game in our
own 'ands; we've got a majority in the Council, and, as Mr Sweater ses,
very few people even take the trouble to read the reports of the
meetings.''Yes, that's right enough,' said Grinder.'But it's just them few wot
would make a lot of trouble and talk; THEY'RE the very people we 'as to
think about.If we can only manage to put THEM in a fog we'll be all
right, and the way to do it is as Mr Sweater proposes.''Yes, I think so,' said the Chief.I can
work it all right in the Ananias and the Chloroform, and of course
you'll see that the Obscurer backs us up.''I'll take care of that,' said Grinder, grimly.The three local papers were run by limited companies.Sweater held
nearly all the shares of the Ananias and of the Weekly Chloroform, and
controlled their policy and contents.Grinder occupied the same
position with regard to the Obscurer.The editors were a sort of
marionettes who danced as Sweater and Grinder pulled the strings.'I wonder how Dr Weakling will take it?''That's the very thing I was just thinkin' about,' cried Didlum.'Don't
you think it would be a good plan if we could arrange to 'ave somebody
took bad--you know, fall down in a fit or something in the street just
outside the Town 'All just before the matter is brought forward in the
Council, and then 'ave someone to come and call 'im out to attend to
the party wot's ill, and keep 'im out till the business is done.''Yes, that's a capital idear,' said Grinder thoughtfully.'But who
could we get to 'ave the fit?It would 'ave to be someone we could
trust, you know.'You wouldn't mind doin' it, would yer?''I should strongly object,' said Rushton haughtily.He regarded the
suggestion that he should act such an undignified part, as a kind of
sacrilege.'Then I'll do it meself if necessary,' said Didlum.'I'm not proud
when there's money to be made; anything for an honest living.''Well, I think we're all agreed, so far,' remarked Sweater.'And I think we all deserve a drink,' the Chief continued, producing a
decanter and a box of cigars from a cupboard by the side of his desk.'Pass that water bottle from behind you, Didlum.''I suppose nobody won't be comin' in?''I'm
a teetotaler, you know.''Oh, it's all right,' said Sweater, taking four glasses out of the
cupboard and pouring out the whisky.'I've given orders that we're not
to be disturbed for anyone.'Well, 'ere's success to Socialism,' cried Grinder, raising his glass,
and taking a big drink.'Amen--'ear, 'ear, I mean,' said Didlum, hastily correcting himself.'Wot I likes about this 'ere business is that we're not only doin'
ourselves a bit of good,' continued Grinder with a laugh, 'we're not
only doin' ourselves a bit of good, but we're likewise doin' the
Socialists a lot of 'arm.When the ratepayers 'ave bought the Works,
and they begins to kick up a row because they're losin' money over
it--we can tell 'em that it's Socialism!And then they'll say that if
that's Socialism they don't want no more of it.'The other brigands laughed gleefully, and some of Didlum's whisky went
down the wrong way and nearly sent him into a fit.'You might as well kill a man at once,' he protested as he wiped the
tears from his eyes, 'you might as well kill a man at once as choke 'im
to death.''And now I've got a bit of good news for you,' said the Chief as he put
his empty glass down.'Although we've had a very rough time of it in our contest with the
Gasworks Company, and although we've got the worst of it, it hasn't
been all lavender for them, you know.They've not enjoyed themselves
either: we hit them pretty hard when we put up the coal dues.''A damn good job too,' said Grinder malignantly.'Well,' continued Sweater, 'they're just as sick of the fight as they
want to be, because of course they don't know exactly how badly we've
been hit.For all they know, we could have continued the struggle
indefinitely: and--well, to make a long story short, I've had a talk
with the managing director and one or two others, and they're willing
to let us in with them.So that we can put the money we get for the
Electric Light Works into gas shares!'This was such splendid news that they had another drink on the strength
of it, and Didlum said that one of the first things they would have to
do would be to totally abolish the Coal Dues, because they pressed so
hard on the poor.Chapter 31

The Deserter


About the end of January, Slyme left Easton's.The latter had not
succeeded in getting anything to do since the work at 'The Cave' was
finished, and latterly the quality of the food had been falling off.The twelve shillings Slyme paid for his board and lodging was all that
Ruth had to keep house with.She had tried to get some work to do
herself, but generally without success; there were one or two jobs that
she might have had if she had been able to give her whole time to them,
but of course that was not possible; the child and the housework had to
be attended to, and Slyme's meals had to be prepared.Nevertheless, she
contrived to get away several times when she had a chance of earning a
few shillings by doing a day's charing for some lady or other, and then
she left everything in such order at home that Easton was able to
manage all right while she was away.On these occasions, she usually
left the baby with Owen's wife, who was an old schoolmate of hers.Nora was the more willing to render her this service because Frankie
used to be so highly delighted whenever it happened.He never tired of
playing with the child, and for several days afterwards he used to
worry his mother with entreaties to buy a baby of their own.Easton earned a few shillings occasionally; now and then he got a job
to clean windows, and once or twice he did a few days' or hours' work
with some other painter who had been fortunate enough to get a little
job 'on his own'--such as a ceiling to wash and whiten, or a room or
two to paint; but such jobs were few.Sometimes, when they were very hard up, they sold something; the Bible
that used to lie on the little table in the bay window was one of the
first things to be parted with.Ruth erased the inscription from the
fly-leaf and then they sold the book at a second-hand shop for two
shillings.As time went on, they sold nearly everything that was
saleable, except of course, the things that were obtained on the hire
system.Slyme could see that they were getting very much into debt and behind
with the rent, and on two occasions already Easton had borrowed five
shillings from him, which he might never be able to pay back.Another
thing was that Slyme was always in fear that Ruth--who had never wholly
abandoned herself to wrongdoing--might tell Easton what had happened;
more than once she had talked of doing so, and the principal reason why
she refrained was that she knew that even if he forgave her, he could
never think the same of her as before.Slyme repeatedly urged this
view upon her, pointing out that no good could result from such a
confession.Latterly the house had become very uncomfortable.It was not only that
the food was bad and that sometimes there was no fire, but Ruth and
Easton were nearly always quarrelling about something or other.She
scarcely spoke to Slyme at all, and avoided sitting at the table with
him whenever possible.He was in constant dread that Easton might
notice her manner towards him, and seek for some explanation.Altogether the situation was so unpleasant that Slyme determined to
clear out.He made the excuse that he had been offered a few weeks'
work at a place some little distance outside the town.After he was
gone they lived for several weeks in semi-starvation on what credit
they could get and by selling the furniture or anything else they
possessed that could be turned into money.The things out of Slyme's
room were sold almost directly he left.Chapter 32

The Veteran


Old Jack Linden had tried hard to earn a little money by selling
bloaters, but they often went bad, and even when he managed to sell
them all the profit was so slight that it was not worth doing.Before the work at 'The Cave' was finished, Philpot was a good friend
to them; he frequently gave old Jack sixpence or a shilling and often
brought a bag of cakes or buns for the children.Sometimes he came to
tea with them on Sundays as an excuse for bringing a tin of salmon.Elsie and Charley frequently went to Owen's house to take tea with
Frankie; in fact, whilst Owen had anything to do, they almost lived
there, for both Owen and Nora, knowing that the Lindens had nothing to
live on except the earnings of the young woman, encouraged the children
to come often.Old Jack made some hopeless attempts to get work--work of any kind, but
nobody wanted him; and to make things worse, his eyesight, which had
been failing for a long time, became very bad.Once he was given a job
by a big provision firm to carry an advertisement about the streets.The man who had been carrying it before--an old soldier--had been
sacked the previous day for getting drunk while on duty.The
advertisement was not an ordinary pair of sandwich boards, but a sort
of box without any bottom or lid, a wooden frame, four sides covered
with canvas, on which were pasted printed bills advertising margarine.Each side of this box or frame was rather larger than an ordinary
sandwich board.Old Linden had to get inside this thing and carry it about the streets;
two straps fixed across the top of the frame and passing one over each
of his shoulders enabled him to carry it.It swayed about a good deal
as he walked along, especially when the wind caught it, but there were
two handles inside to hold it steady by.The pay was eighteenpence a
day, and he had to travel a certain route, up and down the busiest
streets.At first the frame did not feel very heavy, but the weight seemed to
increase as the time went on, and the straps hurt his shoulders.He
felt very much ashamed, also, whenever he encountered any of his old
mates, some of whom laughed at him.In consequence of the frame requiring so much attention to keep it
steady, and being unused to the work, and his sight so bad, he several
times narrowly escaped being run over.Another thing that added to his
embarrassment was the jeering of the other sandwichmen, the loafers
outside the public houses, and the boys, who shouted 'old Jack in the
box' after him.Sometimes the boys threw refuse at the frame, and once
a decayed orange thrown by one of them knocked his hat off.By the time evening came he was scarcely able to stand for weariness.His shoulders, his legs and his feet ached terribly, and as he was
taking the thing back to the shop he was accosted by a ragged,
dirty-looking, beer-sodden old man whose face was inflamed with drink
and fury.'This was the old soldier who had been discharged the
previous day.He cursed and swore in the most awful manner and accused
Linden of 'taking the bread out of his mouth', and, shaking his fist
fiercely at him, shouted that he had a good mind to knock his face
through his head and out of the back of his neck.He might possibly
have tried to put this threat into practice but for the timely
appearance of a policeman, when he calmed down at once and took himself
off.Jack did not go back the next day; he felt that he would rather starve
than have any more of the advertisement frame, and after this he seemed
to abandon all hope of earning money: wherever he went it was the
same--no one wanted him.So he just wandered about the streets
aimlessly, now and then meeting an old workmate who asked him to have a
drink, but this was not often, for nearly all of them were out of work
and penniless.Chapter 33

The Soldier's Children


During most of this time, Jack Linden's daughter-in-law had 'Plenty of
Work', making blouses and pinafores for Sweater & Co.She had so much
to do that one might have thought that the Tory Millennium had arrived,
and that Tariff Reform was already an accomplished fact.At first they had employed her exclusively on the cheapest kind of
blouses--those that were paid for at the rate of two shillings a dozen,
but they did not give her many of that sort now.She did the work so
neatly that they kept her busy on the better qualities, which did not
pay her so well, because although she was paid more per dozen, there
was a great deal more work in them than in the cheaper kinds.Once she
had a very special one to make, for which she was paid six shillings;
but it took her four and a half days--working early and late--to do it.The lady who bought this blouse was told that it came from Paris, and
paid three guineas for it.But of course Mrs Linden knew nothing of
that, and even if she had known, it would have made no difference to
her.Most of the money she earned went to pay the rent, and sometimes there
was only two or three shillings left to buy food for all of them:
sometimes not even so much, because although she had Plenty of Work she
was not always able to do it.There were times when the strain of
working the machine was unendurable: her shoulders ached, her arms
became cramped, and her eyes pained so that it was impossible to
continue.Then for a change she would leave the sewing and do some
housework.Once, when they owed four weeks' rent, the agent was so threatening
that they were terrified at the thought of being sold up and turned out
of the house, and so she decided to sell the round mahogany table and
some of the other things out of the sitting-room.Nearly all the
furniture that was in the house now belonged to her, and had formed her
home before her husband died.The old people had given most of their
things away at different times to their other sons since she had come
to live there.These men were all married and all in employment.One
was a fitter at the gasworks; the second was a railway porter, and the
other was a butcher; but now that the old man was out of work they
seldom came to the house.The last time they had been there was on
Christmas Eve, and then there had been such a terrible row between them
that the children had been awakened by it and frightened nearly out of
their lives.The cause of the row was that some time previously they
had mutually agreed to each give a shilling a week to the old people.They had done this for three weeks and after that the butcher had
stopped his contribution: it had occurred to him that he was not to be
expected to help to keep his brother's widow and her children.If the
old people liked to give up the house and go to live in a room
somewhere by themselves, he would continue paying his shilling a week,
but not otherwise.Upon this the railway porter and the gas-fitter
also ceased paying.They said it wasn't fair that they should pay a
shilling a week each when the butcher--who was the eldest and earned
the best wages--paid nothing.Provided he paid, they would pay; but if
he didn't pay anything, neither would they.On Christmas Eve they all
happened to come to the house at the same time; each denounced the
others, and after nearly coming to blows they all went away raging and
cursing and had not been near the place since.As soon as she decided to sell the things, Mary went to Didlum's
second-hand furniture store, and the manager said he would ask Mr
Didlum to call and see the table and other articles.She waited
anxiously all the morning, but he did not appear, so she went once more
to the shop to remind him.When he did come at last he was very
contemptuous of the table and of everything else she offered to sell.Five shillings was the very most he could think of giving for the
table, and even then he doubted whether he would ever get his money
back.Eventually he gave her thirty shillings for the table, the
overmantel, the easy chair, three other chairs and the two best
pictures--one a large steel engraving of 'The Good Samaritan' and the
other 'Christ Blessing Little Children'.He paid the money at once; half an hour afterwards the van came to take
the things away, and when they were gone, Mary sank down on the
hearthrug in the wrecked room and sobbed as if her heart would break.Slowly, piece by
piece, in order to buy food and to pay the rent, the furniture was
sold.Every time Didlum came he affected to be doing them a very great
favour by buying the things at all.Business was so bad: it might be years before he could
sell them again, and so on.Once or twice he asked Mary if she did not
want to sell the clock--the one that her late husband had made for his
mother, but Mary shrank from the thought of selling this, until at last
there was nothing else left that Didlum would buy, and one week, when
Mary was too ill to do any needlework--it had to go.He gave them ten
shillings for it.Mary had expected the old woman to be heartbroken at having to part
with this clock, but she was surprised to see her almost indifferent.The truth was, that lately both the old people seemed stunned, and
incapable of taking an intelligent interest in what was happening
around them, and Mary had to attend to everything.From time to time nearly all their other possessions--things of
inferior value that Didlum would not look at, she carried out and sold
at small second-hand shops in back streets or pledged at the
pawn-broker's.The feather pillows, sheets, and blankets: bits of
carpet or oilcloth, and as much of their clothing as was saleable or
pawnable.They felt the loss of the bedclothes more than anything
else, for although all the clothes they wore during the day, and all
the old clothes and dresses in the house, and even an old 
tablecloth, were put on the beds at night, they did not compensate for
the blankets, and they were often unable to sleep on account of the
intense cold.A lady district visitor who called occasionally sometimes gave Mary an
order for a hundredweight of coal or a shillingsworth of groceries, or
a ticket for a quart of soup, which Elsie fetched in the evening from
the Soup Kitchen.But this was not very often, because, as the lady
said, there were so many cases similar to theirs that it was impossible
to do more than a very little for any one of them.Sometimes Mary became so weak and exhausted through overwork, worry,
and lack of proper food that she broke down altogether for the time
being, and positively could not do any work at all.Then she used to
lie down on the bed in her room and cry.Whenever she became like this, Elsie and Charley used to do the
housework when they came home from school, and make tea and toast for
her, and bring it to the bedside on a chair so that she could eat lying
down.When there was no margarine or dripping to put on the toast,
they made it very thin and crisp and pretended it was biscuit.The children rather enjoyed these times; the quiet and leisure was so
different from other days when their mother was so busy she had no time
to speak to them.They would sit on the side of the bed, the old grandmother in her chair
opposite with the cat beside her listening to the conversation and
purring or mewing whenever they stroked it or spoke to it.They talked
principally of the future.Elsie said she was going to be a teacher
and earn a lot of money to bring home to her mother to buy things with.Charley was thinking of opening a grocer's shop and having a horse and
cart.When one has a grocer's shop, there is always plenty to eat;
even if you have no money, you can take as much as you like out of your
shop--good stuff, too, tins of salmon, jam, sardines, eggs, cakes,
biscuits and all those sorts of things--and one was almost certain to
have some money every day, because it wasn't likely that a whole day
would go by without someone or other coming into the shop to buy
something.When delivering the groceries with the horse and cart, he
would give rides to all the boys he knew, and in the summertime, after
the work was done and the shop shut up, Mother and Elsie and Granny
could also come for long rides into the country.The old grandmother--who had latterly become quite childish--used to
sit and listen to all this talk with a superior air.Sometimes she
argued with the children about their plans, and ridiculed them.She
used to say with a chuckle that she had heard people talk like that
before--lots of times--but it never came to nothing in the end.One week about the middle of February, when they were in very sore
straits indeed, old Jack applied to the secretary of the Organized
Benevolence Society for assistance.It was about eleven o'clock in the
morning when he turned the corner of the street where the office of the
society was situated and saw a crowd of about thirty men waiting for
the doors to be opened in order to apply for soup tickets.Some of
these men were of the tramp or the drunken loafer class; some were old,
broken-down workmen like himself, and others were labourers wearing
corduroy or moleskin trousers with straps round their legs under their
knees.Linden waited at a distance until all these were gone before he went
in.The secretary received him sympathetically and gave him a big form
to fill up, but as Linden's eyes were so bad and his hand so unsteady
the secretary very obligingly wrote in the answers himself, and
informed him that he would inquire into the case and lay his
application before the committee at the next meeting, which was to be
held on the following Thursday--it was then Monday.Linden explained to him that they were actually starving.He had been
out of work for sixteen weeks, and during all that time they had lived
for the most part on the earnings of his daughter-in-law, but she had
not done anything for nearly a fortnight now, because the firm she
worked for had not had any work for her to do.There was no food in
the house and the children were crying for something to eat.All last
week they had been going to school hungry, for they had had nothing but
dry bread and tea every day: but this week--as far as he could
see--they would not get even that.After some further talk the
secretary gave him two soup tickets and an order for a loaf of bread,
and repeated his promise to inquire into the case and bring it before
the committee.As Jack was returning home he passed the Soup Kitchen, where he saw the
same lot of men who had been to the office of the Organized Benevolence
Society for the soup tickets.They were waiting in a long line to be
admitted.The premises being so small, the proprietor served them in
batches of ten at a time.On Wednesday the secretary called at the house, and on Friday Jack
received a letter from him to the effect that the case had been duly
considered by the committee, who had come to the conclusion that as it
was a 'chronic' case they were unable to deal with it, and advised him
to apply to the Board of Guardians.This was what Linden had hitherto
shrunk from doing, but the situation was desperate.They owed five
weeks' rent, and to crown their misfortune his eyesight had become so
bad that even if there had been any prospect of obtaining work it was
very doubtful if he could have managed to do it.So Linden, feeling
utterly crushed and degraded, swallowed all that remained of his pride
and went like a beaten dog to see the relieving officer, who took him
before the Board, who did not think it a suitable case for out-relief,
and after some preliminaries it was arranged that Linden and his wife
were to go into the workhouse, and Mary was to be allowed three
shillings a week to help her to support herself and the two children.As for Linden's sons, the Guardians intimated their Intention of
compelling them to contribute towards the cost of their parents'
maintenance.Mary accompanied the old people to the gates of their future
dwelling-place, and when she returned home she found there a letter
addressed to J. Linden.It was from the house agent and contained a
notice to leave the house before the end of the ensuing week.Nothing
was said about the rent that was due.Perhaps Mr Sweater thought that
as he had already received nearly six hundred pounds in rent from
Linden he could afford to be generous about the five weeks that were
still owing--or perhaps he thought there was no possibility of getting
the money.However that may have been, there was no reference to it in
the letter--it was simply a notice to clear out, addressed to Linden,
but meant for Mary.It was about half past three o'clock in the afternoon when she returned
home and found this letter on the floor in the front passage.She was
faint with fatigue and hunger, for she had had nothing but a cup of tea
and a slice of bread that day, and her fare had not been much better
for many weeks past.The children were at school, and the house--now
almost destitute of furniture and without carpets or oilcloth on the
floors--was deserted and cold and silent as a tomb.On the kitchen
table were a few cracked cups and saucers, a broken knife, some lead
teaspoons, a part of a loaf, a small basin containing some dripping and
a brown earthenware teapot with a broken spout.Near the table were two
broken kitchen chairs, one with the top cross-piece gone from the back,
and the other with no back to the seat at all.The bareness of the
walls was relieved only by a  almanac and some paper pictures
which the children had tacked upon them, and by the side of the
fireplace was the empty wicker chair where the old woman used to sit.There was no fire in the grate, and the cold hearth was untidy with an
accumulation of ashes, for during the trouble of these last few days
she had not had time or heart to do any housework.The floor was
unswept and littered with scraps of paper and dust: in one corner was a
heap of twigs and small branches of trees that Charley had found
somewhere and brought home for the fire.The same disorder prevailed all through the house: all the doors were
open, and from where she stood in the kitchen she could see the bed she
shared with Elsie, with its heterogeneous heap of coverings.The
sitting-room contained nothing but a collection of odds and ends of
rubbish which belonged to Charley--his 'things' as he called them--bits
of wood, string and rope; one wheel of a perambulator, a top, an iron
hoop and so on.Through the other door was visible the dilapidated
bedstead that had been used by the old people, with a similar lot of
bedclothes to those on her own bed, and the torn, ragged covering of
the mattress through the side of which the flock was protruding and
falling in particles on to the floor.As she stood there with the letter in her hand--faint and weary in the
midst of all this desolation, it seemed to her as if the whole world
were falling to pieces and crumbling away all around her.Chapter 34

The Beginning of the End


During the months of January and February, Owen, Crass, Slyme and
Sawkins continued to work at irregular intervals for Rushton & Co.,
although--even when there was anything to do--they now put in only six
hours a day, commencing in the morning and leaving off at four, with an
hour's interval for dinner between twelve and one.They finished the
'plant' and painted the front of Rushton's shop.When all this was
completed, as no other work came in, they all had to'stand off' with
the exception of Sawkins, who was kept on because he was cheap and able
to do all sorts of odd jobs, such as unstopping drains, repairing leaky
roofs, rough painting or lime-washing, and he was also useful as a
labourer for the plumbers, of whom there were now three employed at
Rushton's, the severe weather which had come in with January having
made a lot of work in that trade.With the exception of this one
branch, practically all work was at a standstill.had had several 'boxing-up' jobs to do,
and Crass always did the polishing of the coffins on these occasions,
besides assisting to take the 'box' home when finished and to 'lift in'
the corpse, and afterwards he always acted as one of the bearers at the
funerals.For an ordinary class funeral he usually put in about three
hours for the polishing; that came to one and nine.Taking home the
coffin and lifting in the corpse, one shilling--usually there were two
men to do this besides Hunter, who always accompanied them to
superintend the work--attending the funeral and acting as bearer, four
shillings: so that altogether Crass made six shillings and ninepence
out of each funeral, and sometimes a little more.For instance, when
there was an unusually good-class corpse they had a double coffin and
then of course there were two 'lifts in', for the shell was taken home
first and the outer coffin perhaps a day or two later: this made
another shilling.No matter how expensive the funeral was, the bearers
never got any more money.Sometimes the carpenter and Crass were able
to charge an hour or two more on the making and polishing of a coffin
for a good job, but that was all.Sometimes, when there was a very
cheap job, they were paid only three shillings for attending as
bearers, but this was not often: as a rule they got the same amount
whether it was a cheap funeral or an expensive one.Slyme earned only
five shillings out of each funeral, and Owen only one and six--for
writing the coffin plate.Sometimes there were three or four funerals in a week, and then Crass
did very well indeed.He still had the two young men lodgers at his
house, and although one of them was out of work he was still able to
pay his way because he had some money in the bank.One of the funeral jobs led to a terrible row between Crass and
Sawkins.The corpse was that of a well-to-do woman who had been ill
for a long time with cancer of the stomach, and after the funeral
Rushton & Co.had to clean and repaint and paper the room she had
occupied during her illness.Although cancer is not supposed to be an
infectious disease, they had orders to take all the bedding away and
have it burnt.Sawkins was instructed to take a truck to the house and
get the bedding and take it to the town Refuse Destructor to be
destroyed.There were two feather beds, a bolster and two pillows:
they were such good things that Sawkins secretly resolved that instead
of taking them to the Destructor he would take them to a second-hand
dealer and sell them.As he was coming away from the house with the things he met Hunter, who
told him that he wanted him for some other work; so he was to take the
truck to the yard and leave it there for the present; he could take the
bedding to the Destructor later on in the day.Sawkins did as Hunter
ordered, and in the meantime Crass, who happened to be working at the
yard painting some venetian blinds, saw the things on the truck, and,
hearing what was to be done with them, he also thought it was a pity
that such good things should be destroyed: so when Sawkins came in the
afternoon to take them away Crass told him he need not trouble; 'I'm
goin' to 'ave that lot, he said; 'they're too good to chuck away;
there's nothing wrong with 'em.'He said he had been told to take
them to the Destructor, and he was going to do so.He was dragging the
cart out of the yard when Crass rushed up and lifted the bundle off and
carried it into the paint-shop.Sawkins ran after him and they began
to curse and swear at each other; Crass accusing Sawkins of intending
to take the things to the marine stores and sell them.Sawkins seized
hold of the bundle with the object of replacing it on the cart, but
Crass got hold of it as well and they had a tussle for it--a kind of
tug of war--reeling and struggling all over the shop.cursing and
swearing horribly all the time.Finally, Sawkins--being the better man
of the two--succeeded in wrenching the bundle away and put it on the
cart again, and then Crass hurriedly put on his coat and said he was
going to the office to ask Mr Rushton if he might have the things.Upon hearing this, Sawkins became so infuriated that he lifted the
bundle off the cart and, throwing it upon the muddy ground, right into
a pool of dirty water, trampled it underfoot; and then, taking out his
clasp knife, began savagely hacking and ripping the ticking so that the
feathers all came falling out.In a few minutes he had damaged the
things beyond hope of repair, while Crass stood by, white and
trembling, watching the proceedings but lacking the courage to
interfere.'Now go to the office and ask Rushton for 'em, if you like!''You can 'ave 'em now, if you want 'em.'Crass made no answer and, after a moment's hesitation, went back to his
work, and Sawkins piled the things on the cart once more and took them
away to the Destructor.He would not be able to sell them now, but at
any rate he had stopped that dirty swine Crass from getting them.When Crass went back to the paint-shop he found there one of the
pillows which had fallen out of the bundle during the struggle.He
took it home with him that evening and slept upon it.It was a fine
pillow, much fuller and softer and more cosy than the one he had been
accustomed to.A few days afterwards when he was working at the room where the woman
died, they gave him some other things that had belonged to her to do
away with, and amongst them was a kind of wrap of grey knitted wool.Crass kept this for himself: it was just the thing to wrap round one's
neck when going to work on a cold morning, and he used it for that
purpose all through the winter.In addition to the funerals, there was
a little other work: sometimes a room or two to be painted and papered
and ceilings whitened, and once they had the outside of two small
cottages to paint--doors and windows--two coats.All four of them
worked at this job and it was finished in two days.Some weeks Crass earned a pound or eighteen shillings; sometimes a
little more, generally less and occasionally nothing at all.There was a lot of jealousy and ill-feeling amongst them about the
work.Slyme and Crass were both aggrieved about Sawkins whenever they
were idle, especially if the latter were painting or whitewashing, and
their indignation was shared by all the others who were 'off'.Harlow
swore horribly about it, and they all agreed that it was disgraceful
that a bloody labourer should be employed doing what ought to be
skilled work for fivepence an hour, while properly qualified men were
'walking about'.These other men were also incensed against Slyme and
Crass because the latter were given the preference whenever there was a
little job to do, and it was darkly insinuated that in order to secure
this preference these two were working for sixpence an hour.There was
no love lost between Crass and Slyme either: Crass was furious whenever
it happened that Slyme had a few hours' work to do if he himself were
idle, and if ever Crass was working while Slyme was'standing still'
the latter went about amongst the other unemployed men saying ugly
things about Crass, whom he accused of being a 'crawler'.Owen also
came in for his share of abuse and blame: most of them said that a man
like him should stick out for higher wages whether employed on special
work or not, and then he would not get any preference.But all the
same, whatever they said about each other behind each other's backs,
they were all most friendly to each other when they met face to face.Once or twice Owen did some work--such as graining a door or writing a
sign--for one or other of his fellow workmen who had managed to secure
a little job 'on his own', but putting it all together, the
coffin-plates and other work at Rushton's and all, his earnings had not
averaged ten shillings a week for the last six weeks.Often they had
no coal and sometimes not even a penny to put into the gas meter, and
then, having nothing left good enough to pawn, he sometimes obtained a
few pence by selling some of his books to second-hand book dealers.However, bad as their condition was, Owen knew that they were better
off than the majority of the others, for whenever he went out he was
certain to meet numbers of men whom he had worked with at different
times, who said--some of them--that they had been idle for ten, twelve,
fifteen and in some cases for twenty weeks without having earned a
shilling.Owen used to wonder how they managed to continue to exist.Most of
them were wearing other people's cast-off clothes, hats, and boots,
which had in some instances been given to their wives by 'visiting
ladies', or by the people at whose houses their wives went to work,
charing.As for food, most of them lived on such credit as they could
get, and on the scraps of broken victuals and meat that their wives
brought home from the places they worked at.Some of them had grown-up
sons and daughters who still lived with them and whose earnings kept
their homes together, and the wives of some of them eked out a
miserable existence by letting lodgings.The week before old Linden went into the workhouse Owen earned nothing,
and to make matters worse the grocer from whom they usually bought
their things suddenly refused to let them have any more credit.Owen
went to see him, and the man said he was very sorry, but he could not
let them have anything more without the money; he did not mind waiting
a few weeks for what was already owing, but he could not let the amount
get any higher; his books were full of bad debts already.In
conclusion, he said that he hoped Owen would not do as so many others
had done and take his ready money elsewhere.People came and got
credit from him when they were hard up, and afterwards spent their
ready money at the Monopole Company's stores on the other side of the
street, because their goods were a trifle cheaper, and it was not fair.Owen admitted that it was not fair, but reminded him that they always
bought their things at his shop.The grocer, however, was inexorable;
he repeated several times that his books were full of bad debts and his
own creditors were pressing him.During their conversation the
shopkeeper's eyes wandered continually to the big store on the other
side of the street; the huge, gilded letters of the name 'Monopole
Stores' seemed to have an irresistible attraction for him.Once he
interrupted himself in the middle of a sentence to point out to Owen a
little girl who was just coming out of the Stores with a small parcel
in her hand.'Her father owes me nearly thirty shillings,' he said, 'but they spend
their ready money there.'The front of the grocer's shop badly needed repainting, and the name on
the fascia, 'A.Smallman', was so faded as to be almost indecipherable.It had been Owen's intention to offer to do this work--the cost to go
against his account--but the man appeared to be so harassed that Owen
refrained from making the suggestion.They still had credit at the baker's, but they did not take much bread:
when one has had scarcely anything else but bread to eat for nearly a
month one finds it difficult to eat at all.That same day, when he
returned home after his interview with the grocer, they had a loaf of
beautiful fresh bread, but none of them could eat it, although they
were hungry: it seemed to stick in their throats, and they could not
swallow it even with the help of a drink of tea.But they drank the
tea, which was the one thing that enabled them to go on living.The next week Owen earned eight shillings altogether: a few hours he
put in assisting Crass to wash off and whiten a ceiling and paint a
room, and there was one coffin-plate.He wrote the latter at home, and
while he was doing it he heard Frankie--who was out in the scullery
with Nora--say to her:

'Mother, how many more days to you think we'll have to have only dry
bread and tea?'Owen's heart seemed to stop as he heard the child's question and
listened for Nora's answer, but the question was not to be answered at
all just then, for at that moment they heard someone running up the
stairs and presently the door was unceremoniously thrown open and
Charley Linden rushed into the house, out of breath, hatless, and
crying piteously.His clothes were old and ragged; they had been
patched at the knees and elbows, but the patches were tearing away from
the rotting fabric into which they had been sewn.He had on a pair of
black stockings full of holes through which the skin was showing.The
soles of his boots were worn through at one side right to the uppers,
and as he walked the sides of his bare heels came into contact with the
floor, the front part of the sole of one boot was separated from the
upper, and his bare toes, red with cold and covered with mud, protruded
through the gap.Some sharp substance--a nail or a piece of glass or
flint--had evidently lacerated his right foot, for blood was oozing
from the broken heel of his boot on to the floor.They were unable to make much sense of the confused story he told them
through his sobs as soon as he was able to speak.All that was clear
was that there was something very serious the matter at home: he
thought his mother must be either dying or dead, because she did not
speak or move or open her eyes, and 'please, please, please will you
come home with me and see her?'While Nora was getting ready to go with the boy, Owen made him sit on a
chair, and having removed the boot from the foot that was bleeding,
washed the cut with some warm water and bandaged it with a piece of
clean rag, and then they tried to persuade him to stay there with
Frankie while Nora went to see his mother, but the boy would not hear
of it.Owen could not go because
he had to finish the coffin-plate, which was only just commenced.It will be remembered that we left Mary Linden alone in the house after
she returned from seeing the old people away.When the children came
home from school, about half an hour afterwards, they found her sitting
in one of the chairs with her head resting on her arms on the table,
unconscious.They were terrified, because they could not awaken her
and began to cry, but presently Charley thought of Frankie's mother
and, telling his sister to stay there while he was gone, he started off
at a run for Owen's house, leaving the front door wide open after him.When Nora and the two boys reached the house they found there two other
women neighbours, who had heard Elsie crying and had come to see what
was wrong.Mary had recovered from her faint and was lying down on the
bed.Nora stayed with her for some time after the other women went
away.She lit the fire and gave the children their tea--there was
still some coal and food left of what had been bought with the three
shillings obtained from the Board of Guardians--and afterwards she
tidied the house.Mary said that she did not know exactly what she would have to do in
the future.If she could get a room somewhere for two or three
shillings a week, her allowance from the Guardians would pay the rent,
and she would be able to earn enough for herself and the children to
live on.This was the substance of the story that Nora told Owen when she
returned home.He had finished writing the coffin-plate, and as it was
now nearly dry he put on his coat and took it down to the carpenter's
shop at the yard.On his way back he met Easton, who had been hanging about in the vain
hope of seeing Hunter and finding out if there was any chance of a job.As they walked along together, Easton confided to Owen that he had
earned scarcely anything since he had been stood off at Rushton's, and
what he had earned had gone, as usual, to pay the rent.Slyme had left
them some time ago.Ruth did not seem able to get on with him; she had
been in a funny sort of temper altogether, but since he had gone she
had had a little work at a boarding-house on the Grand Parade.But
things had been going from bad to worse.They had not been able to keep
up the payments for the furniture they had hired, so the things had
been seized and carted off.They had even stripped the oilcloth from
the floor.Easton remarked he was sorry he had not tacked the bloody
stuff down in such a manner that they would not have been able to take
it up without destroying it.He had been to see Didlum, who said he
didn't want to be hard on them, and that he would keep the things
together for three months, and if Easton had paid up arrears by that
time he could have them back again, but there was, in Easton's opinion,
very little chance of that.Here was a man who grumbled at
the present state of things, yet took no trouble to think for himself
and try to alter them, and who at the first chance would vote for the
perpetuation of the System which produced his misery.'Have you heard that old Jack Linden and his wife went to the workhouse
today,' he said.'No,' replied Easton, indifferently.Owen then suggested it would not be a bad plan for Easton to let his
front room, now that it was empty, to Mrs Linden, who would be sure to
pay her rent, which would help Easton to pay his.Easton agreed and
said he would mention it to Ruth, and a few minutes later they parted.The next morning Nora found Ruth talking to Mary Linden about the room
and as the Eastons lived only about five minutes' walk away, they all
three went round there in order that Mary might see the room.The
appearance of the house from outside was unaltered: the white lace
curtains still draped the windows of the front room; and in the centre
of the bay was what appeared to be a small round table covered with a
red cloth, and upon it a geranium in a flowerpot standing in a saucer
with a frill of  tissue paper round it.These things and the
curtains, which fell close together, made it impossible for anyone to
see that the room was, otherwise, unfurnished.The 'table' consisted
of an empty wooden box--procured from the grocer's--stood on end, with
the lid of the scullery copper placed upside down upon it for a top and
covered with an old piece of red cloth.The purpose of this was to
prevent the neighbours from thinking that they were hard up; although
they knew that nearly all those same neighbours were in more or less
similar straits.It was not a very large room, considering that it would have to serve
all purposes for herself and the two children, but Mrs Linden knew that
it was not likely that she would be able to get one as good elsewhere
for the same price, so she agreed to take it from the following Monday
at two shillings a week.As the distance was so short they were able to carry most of the
smaller things to their new home during the next few days, and on the
Monday evening, when it was dark.Owen and Easton brought the
remainder on a truck they borrowed for the purpose from Hunter.During the last weeks of February the severity of the weather
increased.There was a heavy fall of snow on the 20th followed by a
hard frost which lasted several days.About ten o'clock one night a policeman found a man lying unconscious
in the middle of a lonely road.At first he thought the man was drunk,
and after dragging him on to the footpath out of the way of passing
vehicles he went for the stretcher.They took the man to the station
and put him into a cell, which was already occupied by a man who had
been caught in the act of stealing a swede turnip from a barn.When the
police surgeon came he pronounced the supposed drunken man to be dying
from bronchitis and want of food; and he further said that there was
nothing to indicate that the man was addicted to drink.When the
inquest was held a few days afterwards, the coroner remarked that it
was the third case of death from destitution that had occurred in the
town within six weeks.The evidence showed that the man was a plasterer who had walked from
London with the hope of finding work somewhere in the country.He had
no money in his possession when he was found by the policeman; all that
his pockets contained being several pawn-tickets and a letter from his
wife, which was not found until after he died, because it was in an
inner pocket of his waistcoat.A few days before this inquest was
held, the man who had been arrested for stealing the turnip had been
taken before the magistrates.The poor wretch said he did it because
he was starving, but Aldermen Sweater and Grinder, after telling him
that starvation was no excuse for dishonesty, sentenced him to pay a
fine of seven shillings and costs, or go to prison for seven days with
hard labour.As the convict had neither money nor friends, he had to
go to jail, where he was, after all, better off than most of those who
were still outside because they lacked either the courage or the
opportunity to steal something to relieve their sufferings.As time went on the long-continued privation began to tell upon Owen
and his family.He had a severe cough: his eyes became deeply sunken
and of remarkable brilliancy, and his thin face was always either
deathly pale or dyed with a crimson flush.Frankie also began to show the effects of being obliged to go so often
without his porridge and milk; he became very pale and thin and his
long hair came out in handfuls when his mother combed or brushed it.This was a great trouble to the boy, who, since hearing the story of
Samson read out of the Bible at school, had ceased from asking to have
his hair cut short, lest he should lose his strength in consequence.He
used to test himself by going through a certain exercise he had himself
invented, with a flat iron, and he was always much relieved when he
found that, notwithstanding the loss of the porridge, he was still able
to lift the iron the proper number of times.But after a while, as he
found that it became increasingly difficult to go through the exercise,
he gave it up altogether, secretly resolving to wait until 'Dad' had
more work to do, so that he could have the porridge and milk again.He
was sorry to have to discontinue the exercise, but he said nothing
about it to his father or mother because he did not want to 'worry'
them...

Sometimes Nora managed to get a small job of needlework.On one
occasion a woman with a small son brought a parcel of garments
belonging to herself or her husband, an old ulster, several coats, and
so on--things that although they were too old-fashioned or shabby to
wear, yet might look all right if turned and made up for the boy.Nora undertook to do this, and after working several hours every day
for a week she earned four shillings: and even then the woman thought
it was so dear that she did not bring any more.Another time Mrs Easton got her some work at a boarding-house where she
herself was employed.The servant was laid up, and they wanted some
help for a few days.The pay was to be two shillings a day, and
dinner.Owen did not want her to go because he feared she was not
strong enough to do the work, but he gave way at last and Nora went.She had to do the bedrooms, and on the evening of the second day, as a
result of the constant running up and down the stairs carrying heavy
cans and pails of water, she was in such intense pain that she was
scarcely able to walk home, and for several days afterwards had to lie
in bed through a recurrence of her old illness, which caused her to
suffer untold agony whenever she tried to stand.Owen was alternately dejected and maddened by the knowledge of his own
helplessness: when he was not doing anything for Rushton he went about
the town trying to find some other work, but usually with scant
success.He did some samples of showcard and window tickets and
endeavoured to get some orders by canvassing the shops in the town, but
this was also a failure, for these people generally had a ticket-writer
to whom they usually gave their work.He did get a few trifling
orders, but they were scarcely worth doing at the price he got for
them.He used to feel like a criminal when he went into the shops to
ask them for the work, because he realized fully that, in effect, he
was saying to them: 'Take your work away from the other man, and employ
me.'He was so conscious of this that it gave him a shamefaced manner,
which, coupled as it was with his shabby clothing, did not create a
very favourable impression upon those he addressed, who usually treated
him with about as much courtesy as they would have extended to any
other sort of beggar.Generally, after a day's canvassing, he returned
home unsuccessful and faint with hunger and fatigue.Once, when there was a bitterly cold east wind blowing, he was out on
one of these canvassing expeditions and contracted a severe cold: his
chest became so bad that he found it almost impossible to speak,
because the effort to do so often brought on a violent fit of coughing.It was during this time that a firm of drapers, for whom he had done
some showcards, sent him an order for one they wanted in a hurry, it
had to be delivered the next morning, so he stayed up by himself till
nearly midnight to do it.As he worked, he felt a strange sensation in
his chest: it was not exactly a pain, and he would have found it
difficult to describe it in words--it was just a sensation.He did not
attach much importance to it, thinking it an effect of the cold he had
taken, but whatever it was he could not help feeling conscious of it
all the time.Frankie had been put to bed that evening at the customary hour, but did
not seem to be sleeping as well as usual.Owen could hear him twisting
and turning about and uttering little cries in his sleep.He left his work several times to go into the boy's room and cover him
with the bedclothes which his restless movements had disordered.As
the time wore on, the child became more tranquil, and about eleven
o'clock, when Owen went in to look at him, he found him in a deep
sleep, lying on his side with his head thrown back on the pillow,
breathing so softly through his slightly parted lips that the sound was
almost imperceptible.The fair hair that clustered round his forehead
was damp with perspiration, and he was so still and pale and silent
that one might have thought he was sleeping the sleep that knows no
awakening.About an hour later, when he had finished writing the showcard, Owen
went out into the scullery to wash his hands before going to bed: and
whilst he was drying them on the towel, the strange sensation he had
been conscious of all the evening became more intense, and a few
seconds afterwards he was terrified to find his mouth suddenly filled
with blood.For what seemed an eternity he fought for breath against the
suffocating torrent, and when at length it stopped, he sank trembling
into a chair by the side of the table, holding the towel to his mouth
and scarcely daring to breathe, whilst a cold sweat streamed from every
pore and gathered in large drops upon his forehead.Through the deathlike silence of the night there came from time to time
the chimes of the clock of a distant church, but he continued to sit
there motionless, taking no heed of the passing hours, and possessed
with an awful terror.And afterwards the other two
would be left by themselves at the mercy of the world.In a few years'
time the boy would be like Bert White, in the clutches of some
psalm-singing devil like Hunter or Rushton, who would use him as if he
were a beast of burden.He imagined he could see him now as he would
be then: worked, driven, and bullied, carrying loads, dragging carts,
and running here and there, trying his best to satisfy the brutal
tyrants, whose only thought would be to get profit out of him for
themselves.If he lived, it would be to grow up with his body deformed
and dwarfed by unnatural labour and with his mind stultified, degraded
and brutalized by ignorance and poverty.As this vision of the child's
future rose before him, Owen resolved that it should never be!He
would not leave them alone and defenceless in the midst of the
'Christian' wolves who were waiting to rend them as soon as he was
gone.If he could not give them happiness, he could at least put them
out of the reach of further suffering.If he could not stay with them,
they would have to come with him.It would be kinder and more merciful.Chapter 35

Facing the 'Problem'


Nearly every other firm in the town was in much the same plight as
Rushton & Co.; none of them had anything to speak of to do, and the
workmen no longer troubled to go to the different shops asking for a
job.Most of them just walked about
aimlessly or stood talking in groups in the streets, principally in the
neighbourhood of the Wage Slave Market near the fountain on the Grand
Parade.They congregated here in such numbers that one or two
residents wrote to the local papers complaining of the 'nuisance', and
pointing out that it was calculated to drive the 'better-class'
visitors out of the town.After this two or three extra policemen were
put on duty near the fountain with instructions to'move on' any groups
of unemployed that formed.They could not stop them from coming there,
but they prevented them standing about.The processions of unemployed continued every day, and the money they
begged from the public was divided equally amongst those who took part.Sometimes it amounted to one and sixpence each, sometimes it was a
little more and sometimes a little less.These men presented a
terrible spectacle as they slunk through the dreary streets, through
the rain or the snow, with the slush soaking into their broken boots,
and, worse still, with the bitterly cold east wind penetrating their
rotten clothing and freezing their famished bodies.The majority of the skilled workers still held aloof from these
processions, although their haggard faces bore involuntary testimony to
their sufferings.Although privation reigned supreme in their desolate
homes, where there was often neither food nor light nor fire, they were
too 'proud' to parade their misery before each other or the world.They secretly sold or pawned their clothing and their furniture and
lived in semi-starvation on the proceeds, and on credit, but they would
not beg.Many of them even echoed the sentiments of those who had
written to the papers, and with a strange lack of class-sympathy blamed
those who took part in the processions.They said it was that sort of
thing that drove the 'better class' away, injured the town, and caused
all the poverty and unemployment.However, some of them accepted
charity in other ways; district visitors distributed tickets for coal
and groceries.Not that that sort of thing made much difference; there
was usually a great deal of fuss and advice, many quotations of
Scripture, and very little groceries.And even what there was
generally went to the least-deserving people, because the only way to
obtain any of this sort of 'charity' is by hypocritically pretending to
be religious: and the greater the hypocrite, the greater the quantity
of coal and groceries.These 'charitable' people went into the
wretched homes of the poor and--in effect--said: 'Abandon every
particle of self-respect: cringe and fawn: come to church: bow down and
grovel to us, and in return we'll give you a ticket that you can take
to a certain shop and exchange for a shillingsworth of groceries.And,
if you're very servile and humble we may give you another one next
week.'They never gave the 'case' the money.It prevents the 'case' abusing the 'charity' by spending the
money on drink.It advertises the benevolence of the donors: and it
enables the grocer--who is usually a member of the church--to get rid
of any stale or damaged stock he may have on hand.When these visiting ladies' went into a workman's house and found it
clean and decently furnished, and the children clean and tidy, they
came to the conclusion that those people were not suitable 'cases' for
assistance.Perhaps the children had had next to nothing to eat, and
would have been in rags if the mother had not worked like a slave
washing and mending their clothes.But these were not the sort of
cases that the visiting ladies assisted; they only gave to those who
were in a state of absolute squalor and destitution, and then only on
condition that they whined and grovelled.In addition to this district visitor business, the well-to-do
inhabitants and the local authorities attempted--or rather,
pretended--to grapple with the poverty 'problem' in many other ways,
and the columns of the local papers were filled with letters from all
sorts of cranks who suggested various remedies.One individual, whose
income was derived from brewery shares, attributed the prevailing
distress to the drunken and improvident habits of the lower orders.Another suggested that it was a Divine protest against the growth of
Ritualism and what he called 'fleshly religion', and suggested a day of
humiliation and prayer.A great number of well-fed persons thought
this such an excellent proposition that they proceeded to put it into
practice.They prayed, whilst the unemployed and the little children
fasted.If one had not been oppressed by the tragedy of Want and Misery, one
might have laughed at the farcical, imbecile measures that were taken
to relieve it.Several churches held what they called 'Rummage' or
'jumble' sales.They sent out circulars something like this:

                              JUMBLE SALE
                       in aid of the Unemployed.If you have any articles of any description which are of no
    further use to you, we should be grateful for them, and if you
    will kindly fill in annexed form and post it to us, we will send
    and collect them.On the day of the sale the parish room was transformed into a kind of
Marine Stores, filled with all manner of rubbish, with the parson and
the visiting ladies grinning in the midst.The things were sold for
next to nothing to such as cared to buy them, and the local
rag-and-bone man reaped a fine harvest.The proceeds of these sales
were distributed in 'charity' and it was usually a case of much cry and
little wool.There was a religious organization, called 'The Mugsborough Skull and
Crossbones Boys', which existed for the purpose of perpetuating the
great religious festival of Guy Fawkes.This association also came to
the aid of the unemployed and organized a Grand Fancy Dress Carnival
and Torchlight Procession.When this took place, although there was a
slight sprinkling of individuals dressed in tawdry costumes as
cavaliers of the time of Charles I, and a few more as highwaymen or
footpads, the majority of the processionists were boys in women's
clothes, or wearing sacks with holes cut in them for their heads and
arms, and with their faces smeared with soot.There were also a number
of men carrying frying-pans in which they burnt red and blue fire.The
procession--or rather, mob--was headed by a band, and the band was
headed by two men, arm in arm, one very tall, dressed to represent
Satan, in red tights, with horns on his head, and smoking a large
cigar, and the other attired in the no less picturesque costume of a
bishop of the Established Church.This crew paraded the town, howling and dancing, carrying flaring
torches, burning the blue and red fire, and some of them singing silly
or obscene songs; whilst the collectors ran about with the boxes
begging for money from people who were in most cases nearly as
poverty-stricken as the unemployed they were asked to assist.The
money thus obtained was afterwards handed over to the Secretary of the
Organized Benevolence Society, Mr Sawney Grinder.Then there was the Soup Kitchen, which was really an inferior
eating-house in a mean street.The man who ran this was a relative of
the secretary of the OBS.He cadged all the ingredients for the soup
from different tradespeople: bones and scraps of meat from butchers:
pea meal and split peas from provision dealers: vegetables from
greengrocers: stale bread from bakers, and so on.Well-intentioned,
charitable old women with more money than sense sent him donations in
cash, and he sold the soup for a penny a basin--or a penny a quart to
those who brought jugs.He had a large number of shilling books printed, each containing
thirteen penny tickets.The Organized Benevolence Society bought a lot
of these books and resold them to benevolent persons, or gave them away
to 'deserving cases'.It was this connection with the OBS that gave
the Soup Kitchen a semi-official character in the estimation of the
public, and furnished the proprietor with the excuse for cadging the
materials and money donations.In the case of the Soup Kitchen, as with the unemployed processions,
most of those who benefited were unskilled labourers or derelicts: with
but few exceptions the unemployed artisans--although their need was
just as great as that of the others--avoided the place as if it were
infected with the plague.They were afraid even to pass through the
street where it was situated lest anyone seeing them coming from that
direction should think they had been there.But all the same, some of
them allowed their children to go there by stealth, by night, to buy
some of this charity-tainted food.Another brilliant scheme, practical and statesmanlike, so different
from the wild projects of demented Socialists, was started by the Rev.Mr Bosher, a popular preacher, the Vicar of the fashionable Church of
the Whited Sepulchre.He collected some subscriptions from a number of
semi-imbecile old women who attended his church.With some of this
money he bought a quantity of timber and opened what he called a Labour
Yard, where he employed a number of men sawing firewood.Being a
clergyman, and because he said he wanted it for a charitable purpose,
of course he obtained the timber very cheaply--for about half what
anyone else would have had to pay for it.The wood-sawing was done piecework.A log of wood about the size of a
railway sleeper had to be sawn into twelve pieces, and each of these
had to be chopped into four.For sawing and chopping one log in this
manner the worker was paid ninepence.One log made two bags of
firewood, which were sold for a shilling each--a trifle under the usual
price.The men who delivered the bags were paid three half-pence for
each two bags.As there were such a lot of men wanting to do this work, no one was
allowed to do more than three lots in one day--that came to two
shillings and threepence--and no one was allowed to do more than two
days in one week.The Vicar had a number of bills printed and displayed in shop windows
calling attention to what he was doing, and informing the public that
orders could be sent to the Vicarage by post and would receive prompt
attention and the fuel could be delivered at any address--Messrs
Rushton & Co.having very kindly lent a handcart for the use of the men
employed at the Labour Yard.As a result of the appearance of this bill, and of the laudatory
notices in the columns of the Ananias, the Obscurer, and the
Chloroform--the papers did not mind giving the business a free
advertisement, because it was a charitable concern--many persons
withdrew their custom from those who usually supplied them with
firewood, and gave their orders to the Yard; and they had the
satisfaction of getting their fuel cheaper than before and of
performing a charitable action at the same time.As a remedy for unemployment this scheme was on a par with the method
of the tailor in the fable who thought to lengthen his cloth by cutting
a piece off one end and sewing it on to the other; but there was one
thing about it that recommended it to the Vicar--it was
self-supporting.He found that there would be no need to use all the
money he had extracted from the semi-imbecile old ladies for timber, so
he bought himself a Newfoundland dog, an antique set of carved ivory
chessmen, and a dozen bottles of whisky with the remainder of the cash.The reverend gentleman hit upon yet another means of helping the poor.He wrote a letter to the Weekly Chloroform appealing for cast-off boots
for poor children.This was considered such a splendid idea that the
editors of all the local papers referred to it in leading articles, and
several other letters were written by prominent citizens extolling the
wisdom and benevolence of the profound Bosher.Most of the boots that
were sent in response to this appeal had been worn until they needed
repair--in a very large proportion of instances, until they were beyond
repair.The poor people to whom they were given could not afford to
have them mended before using them, and the result was that the boots
generally began to fall to pieces after a few days' wear.It did not increase the number of
cast-off boots, and most of the people who 'cast off' their boots
generally gave them to someone or other.The only difference It can
have made was that possibly a few persons who usually threw their boots
away or sold them to second-hand dealers may have been induced to send
them to Mr Bosher instead.But all the same nearly everybody said it
was a splendid idea: its originator was applauded as a public
benefactor, and the pettifogging busybodies who amused themselves with
what they were pleased to term 'charitable work' went into imbecile
ecstasies over him.Chapter 36

The OBS


One of the most important agencies for the relief of distress was the
Organized Benevolence Society.The proceeds of the fancy-dress carnival; the
collections from different churches and chapels which held special
services in aid of the unemployed; the weekly collections made by the
employees of several local firms and business houses; the proceeds of
concerts, bazaars, and entertainments, donations from charitable
persons, and the subscriptions of the members.The society also
received large quantities of cast-off clothing and boots, and tickets
of admission to hospitals, convalescent homes and dispensaries from
subscribers to those institutions, or from people like Rushton & Co.,
who had collecting-boxes in their workshops and offices.Altogether during the last year the Society had received from various
sources about three hundred pounds in hard cash.This money was
devoted to the relief of cases of distress.The largest item in the expenditure of the Society was the salary of
the General Secretary, Mr Sawney Grinder--a most deserving case--who
was paid one hundred pounds a year.After the death of the previous secretary there were so many candidates
for the vacant post that the election of the new secretary was a rather
exciting affair.The excitement was all the more intense because it
was restrained.A special meeting of the society was held: the Mayor,
Alderman Sweater, presided, and amongst those present were Councillors
Rushton, Didlum and Grinder, Mrs Starvem, Rev.Mr Bosher, a number of
the rich, semi-imbecile old women who had helped to open the Labour
Yard, and several other 'ladies'.Some of these were the district
visitors already alluded to, most of them the wives of wealthy citizens
and retired tradesmen, richly dressed, ignorant, insolent, overbearing
frumps, who--after filling themselves with good things in their own
luxurious homes--went flouncing into the poverty-stricken dwellings of
their poor'sisters' and talked to them of'religion', lectured them
about sobriety and thrift, and--sometimes--gave them tickets for soup
or orders for shillingsworths of groceries or coal.Some of these
overfed females--the wives of tradesmen, for instance--belonged to the
Organized Benevolence Society, and engaged in this 'work' for the
purpose of becoming acquainted with people of superior social
position--one of the members was a colonel, and Sir Graball
D'Encloseland--the Member of Parliament for the borough--also belonged
to the Society and occasionally attended its meetings.Others took up
district visiting as a hobby; they had nothing to do, and being densely
ignorant and of inferior mentality, they had no desire or capacity for
any intellectual pursuit.So they took up this work for the pleasure
of playing the grand lady and the superior person at a very small
expense.Other of these visiting ladies were middle-aged, unmarried
women with small private incomes--some of them well-meaning,
compassionate, gentle creatures who did this work because they
sincerely desired to help others, and they knew of no better way.These
did not take much part in the business of the meetings; they paid their
subscriptions and helped to distribute the cast-off clothing and boots
to those who needed them, and occasionally obtained from the secretary
an order for provisions or coal or bread for some poverty-stricken
family; but the poor, toil-worn women whom they visited welcomed them
more for their sisterly sympathy than for the gifts they brought.Some
of the visiting ladies were of this character--but they were not many.They were as a few fragrant flowers amidst a dense accumulation of
noxious weeds.They were examples of humility and kindness shining
amidst a vile and loathsome mass of hypocrisy, arrogance, and cant.When the Chairman had opened the meeting, Mr Rushton moved a vote of
condolence with the relatives of the late secretary whom he eulogized
in the most extraordinary terms.'The poor of Mugsborough had lost a kind and sympathetic friend', 'One
who had devoted his life to helping the needy', and so on and so forth.(As a matter of fact, most of the time of the defunct had been passed
in helping himself, but Rushton said nothing about that.)Mr Didlum seconded the vote of condolence in similar terms, and it was
carried unanimously.Then the Chairman said that the next business was
to elect a successor to the departed paragon; and immediately no fewer
than nine members rose to propose a suitable person--they each had a
noble-minded friend or relative willing to sacrifice himself for the
good of the poor.The nine Benevolent stood looking at each other and at the Chairman
with sickly smiles upon their hypocritical faces.It would never
do to have a contest.The Secretary of the OBS was usually regarded as
a sort of philanthropist by the outside public, and it was necessary to
keep this fiction alive.For one or two minutes an awkward silence reigned.Then, one after
another they all reluctantly resumed their seats with the exception of
Mr Amos Grinder, who said he wished to propose his nephew, Mr Sawney
Grinder, a young man of a most benevolent disposition who was desirous
of immolating himself upon the altar of charity for the benefit of the
poor--or words to that effect.Mr Didlum seconded, and there being no other nomination--for they all
knew that it would give the game away to have a contest--the Chairman
put Mr Grinder's proposal to the meeting and declared it carried
unanimously.Another considerable item in the expenditure of the society was the
rent of the offices--a house in a back street.The landlord of this
place was another very deserving case.There were numerous other expenses: stationery and stamps, printing,
and so on, and what was left of the money was used for the purpose for
which it had been given--a reasonable amount being kept in hand for
future expenses.All the details were of course duly set forth in the
Report and Balance Sheet at the annual meetings.No copy of this
document was ever handed to the reporters for publication; it was read
to the meeting by the Secretary; the representatives of the Press took
notes, and in the reports of the meeting that subsequently appeared in
the local papers the thing was so mixed up and garbled together that
the few people who read it could not make head or tail of it.The only
thing that was clear was that the society had been doing a great deal
of good to someone or other, and that more money was urgently needed to
carry on the work.It usually appeared something like this:

                            HELPING THE NEEDY
                 Mugsborough Organized Benevolence Society
                      Annual Meeting at the Town Hall

           A Splendid record of Miscellaneous and Valuable Work.The annual meeting of the above Society was held yesterday at the
    Town Hall.The Mayor, Alderman Sweater, presided, and amongst
    those present were Sir Graball D'Encloseland, Lady D'Encloseland,
    Lady Slumrent.Mr Bosher, Mr Cheeseman, Mrs Bilder, Mrs
    Grosare, Mrs Daree, Mrs Butcher, Mrs Taylor, Mrs Baker, Mrs
    Starvem, Mrs Slodging, Mrs M. B. Sile, Mrs Knobrane, Mrs M. T.
    Head, Mr Rushton, Mr Didlum, Mr Grinder and (here followed about a
    quarter of a column of names of other charitable persons, all
    subscribers to the Society).The Secretary read the annual report which contained the following
    amongst other interesting items:


    During the year, 1,972 applications for assistance have been
    received, and of this number 1,302 have been assisted as follows:
    Bread or grocery orders, 273.Nurses provided,
    2.Twenty-nine persons, whose cases being chronic, were referred to
    the Poor Law Guardians.Bedding redeemed,
    1.Loans granted to people to enable them to pay their rent, 8.Railway fares for men who were
    going away from the town to employment elsewhere, 12.Advertisements for employment, 4--
    and so on.There was about another quarter of a column of these details, the
reading of which was punctuated with applause and concluded with:
'Leaving 670 cases which for various reasons the Society was unable to
assist'.The report then went on to explain that the work of inquiring
into the genuineness of the applications entailed a lot of labour on
the part of the Secretary, some cases taking several days.No fewer
than 649 letters had been sent out from the office, and 97 postcards.Very few cash gifts were granted, as it was most necessary
to guard against the Charity being abused.Then followed a most remarkable paragraph headed 'The Balance Sheet',
which--as it was put--'included the following'.'The following' was a
jumbled list of items of expenditure, subscriptions, donations,
legacies, and collections, winding up with 'the general summary showed
a balance in hand of L178.4.6'.(They always kept a good balance in
hand because of the Secretary's salary and the rent of the offices.)After this very explicit financial statement came the most important
part of the report: 'Thanks are expressed to Sir Graball D'Encloseland
for a donation of 2 guineas.Mrs Starvem,
Hospital tickets.Lady Slumrent, letter of admission to Convalescent
Home.Mrs Sledging, gifts of clothing--and so on for another
quarter of a column, the whole concluding with a vote of thanks to the
Secretary and an urgent appeal to the charitable public for more funds
to enable the Society to continue its noble work.Meantime, in spite of this and kindred organizations the conditions of
the under-paid poverty stricken and unemployed workers remained the
same.Although the people who got the grocery and coal orders, the
'Nourishment', and the cast-off clothes and boots, were very glad to
have them, yet these things did far more harm than good.They
humiliated, degraded and pauperized those who received them, and the
existence of the societies prevented the problem being grappled with in
a sane and practical manner.The people lacked the necessaries of
life: the necessaries of life are produced by Work: these people were
willing to work, but were prevented from doing so by the idiotic system
of society which these 'charitable' people are determined to do their
best to perpetuate.If the people who expect to be praised and glorified for being
charitable were never to give another farthing it would be far better
for the industrious poor, because then the community as a whole would
be compelled to deal with the absurd and unnecessary state of affairs
that exists today--millions of people living and dying in wretchedness
and poverty in an age when science and machinery have made it possible
to produce such an abundance of everything that everyone might enjoy
plenty and comfort.It if were not for all this so-called charity the
starving unemployed men all over the country would demand to be allowed
to work and produce the things they are perishing for want of, instead
of being--as they are now--content to wear their masters' cast-off
clothing and to eat the crumbs that fall from his table.Chapter 37

A Brilliant Epigram


All through the winter, the wise, practical, philanthropic, fat persons
whom the people of Mugsborough had elected to manage their affairs--or
whom they permitted to manage them without being elected--continued to
grapple, or to pretend to grapple, with the 'problem' of unemployment
and poverty.They continued to hold meetings, rummage and jumble
sales, entertainments and special services.They continued to
distribute the rotten cast-off clothing and boots, and the nourishment
tickets.They were all so sorry for the poor, especially for the 'dear
little children'.They did all sorts of things to help the children.In fact, there was nothing that they would not do for them except levy
a halfpenny rate.It might pauperize
the parents and destroy parental responsibility.They evidently
thought that it would be better to destroy the health or even the lives
of the 'dear little children' than to pauperize the parents or
undermine parental responsibility.These people seemed to think that
the children were the property of their parents.They did not have
sense enough to see that the children are not the property of their
parents at all, but the property of the community.When they attain to
manhood and womanhood they will be, if mentally or physically
inefficient, a burden on the community; if they become criminals, they
will prey upon the community, and if they are healthy, educated and
brought up in good surroundings, they will become useful citizens, able
to render valuable service, not merely to their parents, but to the
community.Therefore the children are the property of the community,
and it is the business and to the interest of the community to see that
their constitutions are not undermined by starvation.The Secretary of
the local Trades Council, a body formed of delegates from all the
different trades unions in the town, wrote a letter to the Obscurer,
setting forth this view.He pointed out that a halfpenny rate in that
town would produce a sum of L800, which would be more than sufficient
to provide food for all the hungry schoolchildren.In the next issue
of the paper several other letters appeared from leading citizens,
including, of course, Sweater, Rushton, Didlum and Grinder, ridiculing
the proposal of the Trades Council, who were insultingly alluded to as
'pothouse politicians', 'beer-sodden agitators' and so forth.Their
right to be regarded as representatives of the working men was denied,
and Grinder, who, having made inquiries amongst working men, was
acquainted with the facts, stated that there was scarcely one of the
local branches of the trades unions which had more than a dozen
members; and as Grinder's statement was true, the Secretary was unable
to contradict it.The majority of the working men were also very
indignant when they heard about the Secretary's letter: they said the
rates were quite high enough as it was, and they sneered at him for
presuming to write to the papers at all:

'Who the bloody 'ell was 'e?''E
was only a workin' man the same as themselves--a common carpenter!What
the 'ell did 'e know about it?'E was just trying to make
'isself out to be Somebody, that was all.The idea of one of the likes
of them writing to the papers!'One day, having nothing better to do, Owen was looking at some books
that were exposed for sale on a table outside a second-hand furniture
shop.One book in particular took his attention: he read several pages
with great interest, and regretted that he had not the necessary
sixpence to buy it.The title of the book was: Consumption: Its Causes
and Its Cure.The author was a well-known physician who devoted his
whole attention to the study of that disease.Amongst other things,
the book gave rules for the feeding of delicate children, and there
were also several different dietaries recommended for adult persons
suffering from the disease.One of these dietaries amused him very
much, because as far as the majority of those who suffer from
consumption are concerned, the good doctor might just as well have
prescribed a trip to the moon:

'Immediately on waking in the morning, half a pint of milk--this should
be hot, if possible--with a small slice of bread and butter.'At breakfast: half a pint of milk, with coffee, chocolate, or oatmeal:
eggs and bacon, bread and butter, or dry toast.'At eleven o'clock: half a pint of milk with an egg beaten up in it or
some beef tea and bread and butter.'At one o'clock: half a pint of warm milk with a biscuit or sandwich.'At two o'clock: fish and roast mutton, or a mutton chop, with as much
fat as possible: poultry, game, etc., may be taken with vegetables, and
milk pudding.'At five o'clock: hot milk with coffee or chocolate, bread and butter,
watercress, etc.'At eight o'clock: a pint of milk, with oatmeal or chocolate, and
gluten bread, or two lightly boiled eggs with bread and butter.'Before retiring to rest: a glass of warm milk.'During the night: a glass of milk with a biscuit or bread and butter
should be placed by the bedside and be eaten if the patient awakes.'Whilst Owen was reading this book, Crass, Harlow, Philpot and Easton
were talking together on the other side of the street, and presently
Crass caught sight of him.They had been discussing the Secretary's
letter re the halfpenny rate, and as Owen was one of the members of the
Trades Council, Crass suggested that they should go across and tackle
him about it.asked Owen after listening for
about a quarter of an hour to Crass's objection.'That means that you would have to pay sevenpence per year if we had a
halfpenny rate.Wouldn't it be worth sevenpence a year to you to know
that there were no starving children in the town?''Why should I 'ave to 'elp to keep the children of a man who's too lazy
to work, or spends all 'is money on drink?'''Ow are
yer goin' to make out about the likes o' them?''If his children are starving we should feed them first, and punish him
afterwards.''The rates is quite high enough as it is,' grumbled Harlow, who had
four children himself.'That's quite true, but you must remember that the rates the working
classes at present pay are spent mostly for the benefit of other
people.Good roads are maintained for people who ride in motor cars
and carriages; the Park and the Town Band for those who have leisure to
enjoy them; the Police force to protect the property of those who have
something to lose, and so on.But if we pay this rate we shall get
something for our money.''We gets the benefit of the good roads when we 'as to push a 'andcart
with a load o' paint and ladders,' said Easton.'Of course,' said Crass, 'and besides, the workin' class gets the
benefit of all the other things too, because it all makes work.''Well, for my part,' said Philpot, 'I wouldn't mind payin' my share
towards a 'appeny rate, although I ain't got no kids o' me own.'The hostility of most of the working men to the proposed rate was
almost as bitter as that of the 'better' classes--the noble-minded
philanthropists who were always gushing out their sympathy for the
'dear little ones', the loathsome hypocrites who pretended that there
was no need to levy a rate because they were willing to give sufficient
money in the form of charity to meet the case: but the children
continued to go hungry all the same.'Loathsome hypocrites' may seem a hard saying, but it was a matter of
common knowledge that the majority of the children attending the local
elementary schools were insufficiently fed.It was admitted that the
money that could be raised by a halfpenny rate would be more than
sufficient to provide them all with one good meal every day.The
charity-mongers who professed such extravagant sympathy with the 'dear
little children' resisted the levying of the rate 'because it would
press so heavily on the poorer ratepayers', and said that they were
willing to give more in voluntary charity than the rate would amount
to: but, the 'dear little children'--as they were so fond of calling
them--continued to go to school hungry all the same.To judge them by their profession and their performances, it appeared
that these good kind persons were willing to do any mortal thing for
the 'dear little children' except allow them to be fed.If these people had really meant to do what they pretended, they would
not have cared whether they paid the money to a rate-collector or to
the secretary of a charity society and they would have preferred to
accomplish their object in the most efficient and economical way.But although they would not allow the children to be fed, they went to
church and to chapel, glittering with jewellery, their fat carcases
clothed in rich raiment, and sat with smug smiles upon their faces
listening to the fat parsons reading out of a Book that none of them
seemed able to understand, for this was what they read:

'And Jesus called a little child unto Him, and set him in the midst of
them, and said: Whosoever shall receive one such little child in My
name, receiveth Me.But whoso shall offend one of these little ones,
it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and
that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.'Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones, for I say unto
you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of My Father.'And this: 'Then shall He say unto them: Depart from me, ye cursed, into
the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels: for I was
an hungered and ye gave Me no meat: I was thirsty and ye gave Me no
drink: I was a stranger and ye took Me not in; naked, and ye clothed Me
not.'Then shall they answer: "Lord, when saw we Thee an hungered or athirst
or a stranger or naked, or sick, and did not minister unto Thee?"and
He shall answer them, "Verily I say unto you, inasmuch as ye did it not
to one of the least of these, ye did it not to Me."'These were the sayings that the infidel parsons mouthed in the infidel
temples to the richly dressed infidel congregations, who heard but did
not understand, for their hearts were become gross and their ears dull
of hearing.And meantime, all around them, in the alley and the slum,
and more terrible still--because more secret--in the better sort of
streets where lived the respectable class of skilled artisans, the
little children became thinner and paler day by day for lack of proper
food, and went to bed early because there was no fire.Sir Graball D'Encloseland, the Member of Parliament for the borough,
was one of the bitterest opponents of the halfpenny rate, but as he
thought it was probable that there would soon be another General
Election and he wanted the children's fathers to vote for him again, he
was willing to do something for them in another way.He had a
ten-year-old daughter whose birthday was in that month, so the
kind-hearted Baronet made arrangements to give a Tea to all the school
children in the town in honour of the occasion.The tea was served in
the schoolrooms and each child was presented with a gilt-edged card on
which was a printed portrait of the little hostess, with 'From your
loving little friend, Honoria D'Encloseland', in gold letters.During
the evening the little girl, accompanied by Sir Graball and Lady
D'Encloseland, motored round to all the schools where the tea was being
consumed: the Baronet made a few remarks, and Honoria made a pretty
little speech, specially learnt for the occasion, at each place, and
they were loudly cheered and greatly admired in response.The
enthusiasm was not confined to the boys and girls, for while the
speechmaking was going on inside, a little crowd of grown-up children
were gathered round outside the entrance, worshipping the motor car:
and when the little party came out the crowd worshipped them also,
going into imbecile ecstasies of admiration of their benevolence and
their beautiful clothes.For several weeks everybody in the town was in raptures over this
tea--or, rather, everybody except a miserable little minority of
Socialists, who said it was bribery, an electioneering dodge, that did
no real good, and who continued to clamour for a halfpenny rate.Another specious fraud was the 'Distress Committee'.This body--or
corpse, for there was not much vitality in it--was supposed to exist
for the purpose of providing employment for 'deserving cases'.One
might be excused for thinking that any man--no matter what his past may
have been--who is willing to work for his living is a 'deserving case':
but this was evidently not the opinion of the persons who devised the
regulations for the working of this committee.Every applicant for
work was immediately given a long job, and presented with a double
sheet of foolscap paper to do it with.Now, if the object of the
committee had been to furnish the applicant with material for the
manufacture of an appropriate headdress for himself, no one could
reasonably have found fault with them: but the foolscap was not to be
utilized in that way; it was called a 'Record Paper', three pages of it
were covered with insulting, inquisitive, irrelevant questions
concerning the private affairs and past life of the 'case' who wished
to be permitted to work for his living, and all these had to be
answered to the satisfaction of Messrs D'Encloseland, Bosher, Sweater,
Rushton, Didlum, Grinder and the other members of the committee, before
the case stood any chance of getting employment.However, notwithstanding the offensive nature of the questions on the
application form, during the five months that this precious committee
was in session, no fewer than 1,237 broken-spirited and humble 'lion's
whelps' filled up the forms and answered the questions as meekly as if
they had been sheep.The funds of the committee consisted of L500,
obtained from the Imperial Exchequer, and about L250 in charitable
donations.This money was used to pay wages for certain work--some of
which would have had to be done even if the committee had never
existed--and if each of the 1,237 applicants had had an equal share of
the work, the wages they would have received would have amounted to
about twelve shillings each.This was what the 'practical' persons,
the 'business-men', called 'dealing with the problem of unemployment'.Imagine having to keep your family for five months with twelve
shillings!And, if you like, imagine that the Government grant had been four times
as much as it was, and that the charity had amounted to four times as
much as it did, and then fancy having to keep your family for five
months with two pounds eight shillings!It is true that some of the members of the committee would have been
very glad if they had been able to put the means of earning a living
within the reach of every man who was willing to work; but they simply
did not know what to do, or how to do it.They were not ignorant of
the reality of the evil they were supposed to be 'dealing
with'--appalling evidences of it faced them on every side, and as,
after all, these committee men were human beings and not devils, they
would have been glad to mitigate it if they could have done so without
hurting themselves: but the truth was that they did not know what to do!These are the 'practical' men; the monopolists of intelligence, the
wise individuals who control the affairs of the world: it is in
accordance with the ideas of such men as these that the conditions of
human life are regulated.This is the position:

It is admitted that never before in the history of mankind was it
possible to produce the necessaries of life in such abundance as at
present.The management of the affairs of the world--the business of arranging
the conditions under which we live--is at present in the hands of
Practical, Level-headed, Sensible Business-men.The result of their management is, that the majority of the people find
it a hard struggle to live.Large numbers exist in perpetual poverty:
a great many more periodically starve: many actually die of want:
hundreds destroy themselves rather than continue to live and suffer.When the Practical, Level-headed, Sensible Business-men are asked why
they do not remedy this state of things, they reply that they do not
know what to do!or, that it is impossible to remedy it!And yet it is admitted that it is now possible to produce the
necessaries of life, in greater abundance than ever before!With lavish kindness, the Supreme Being had provided all things
necessary for the existence and happiness of his creatures.To suggest
that it is not so is a blasphemous lie: it is to suggest that the
Supreme Being is not good or even just.On every side there is an
overflowing superfluity of the materials requisite for the production
of all the necessaries of life: from these materials everything we need
may be produced in abundance--by Work.Here was an army of people
lacking the things that may be made by work, standing idle.Willing to
work; clamouring to be allowed to work, and the Practical,
Level-headed, Sensible Business-men did not know what to do!Of course, the real reason for the difficulty is that the raw materials
that were created for the use and benefit of all have been stolen by a
small number, who refuse to allow them to be used for the purposes for
which they were intended.This numerically insignificant minority
refused to allow the majority to work and produce the things they need;
and what work they do graciously permit to be done is not done with the
object of producing the necessaries of life for those who work, but for
the purpose of creating profit for their masters.And then, strangest fact of all, the people who find it a hard struggle
to live, or who exist in dreadful poverty and sometimes starve, instead
of trying to understand the causes of their misery and to find out a
remedy themselves, spend all their time applauding the Practical,
Sensible, Level-headed Business-men, who bungle and mismanage their
affairs, and pay them huge salaries for doing so.Sir Graball
D'Encloseland, for instance, was a 'Secretary of State' and was paid
L5,000 a year.When he first got the job the wages were only a
beggarly L2,000, but as he found it impossible to exist on less than
L100 a week he decided to raise his salary to that amount; and the
foolish people who find it a hard struggle to live paid it willingly,
and when they saw the beautiful motor car and the lovely clothes and
jewellery he purchased for his wife with the money, and heard the Great
Speech he made--telling them how the shortage of everything was caused
by Over-production and Foreign Competition, they clapped their hands
and went frantic with admiration.Their only regret was that there
were no horses attached to the motor car, because if there had been,
they could have taken them out and harnessed themselves to it instead.Nothing delighted the childish minds of these poor people so much as
listening to or reading extracts from the speeches of such men as
these; so in order to amuse them, every now and then, in the midst of
all the wretchedness, some of the great statesmen made 'great speeches'
full of cunning phrases intended to hoodwink the fools who had elected
them.The very same week that Sir Graball's salary was increased to
L5,000 a year, all the papers were full of a very fine one that he
made.They appeared with large headlines like this:

             GREAT SPEECH BY SIR GRABALL D'ENCLOSELAND

                          Brilliant Epigram!None should have more than they need, whilst any have less than
    they need!The hypocrisy of such a saying in the mouth of a man who was drawing a
salary of five thousand pounds a year did not appear to occur to
anyone.On the contrary, the hired scribes of the capitalist Press
wrote columns of fulsome admiration of the miserable claptrap, and the
working men who had elected this man went into raptures over the
'Brilliant Epigram' as if it were good to eat.They cut it out of the
papers and carried it about with them: they showed it to each other:
they read it and repeated it to each other: they wondered at it and
were delighted with it, grinning and gibbering at each other in the
exuberance of their imbecile enthusiasm.The Distress Committee was not the only body pretending to 'deal' with
the poverty 'problem': its efforts were supplemented by all the other
agencies already mentioned--the Labour Yard, the Rummage Sales, the
Organized Benevolence Society, and so on, to say nothing of a most
benevolent scheme originated by the management of Sweater's Emporium,
who announced in a letter that was published in the local Press that
they were prepared to employ fifty men for one week to carry sandwich
boards at one shilling--and a loaf of bread--per day.They got the men; some unskilled labourers, a few old, worn out
artisans whom misery had deprived of the last vestiges of pride or
shame; a number of habitual drunkards and loafers, and a non-descript
lot of poor ragged old men--old soldiers and others of whom it would be
impossible to say what they had once been.The procession of sandwich men was headed by the Semi-drunk and the
Besotted Wretch, and each board was covered with a printed poster:
'Great Sale of Ladies' Blouses now Proceeding at Adam Sweater's
Emporium.'Besides this artful scheme of Sweater's for getting a good
advertisement on the cheap, numerous other plans for providing
employment or alleviating the prevailing misery were put forward in the
columns of the local papers and at the various meetings that were held.Any foolish, idiotic, useless suggestion was certain to receive
respectful attention; any crafty plan devised in his own interest or
for his own profit by one or other of the crew of sweaters and
landlords who controlled the town was sure to be approved of by the
other inhabitants of Mugsborough, the majority of whom were persons of
feeble intellect who not only allowed themselves to be robbed and
exploited by a few cunning scoundrels, but venerated and applauded them
for doing it.Chapter 38

The Brigands' Cave


One evening in the drawing-room at 'The Cave' there was a meeting of a
number of the 'Shining Lights' to arrange the details of a Rummage
Sale, that was to be held in aid of the unemployed.It was an informal
affair, and while they were waiting for the other luminaries, the early
arrivals, Messrs Rushton, Didlum and Grinder, Mr Oyley Sweater, the
Borough Surveyor, Mr Wireman, the electrical engineer who had been
engaged as an 'expert' to examine and report on the Electric Light
Works, and two or three other gentlemen--all members of the Band--took
advantage of the opportunity to discuss a number of things they were
mutually interested in, which were to be dealt with at the meeting of
the Town Council the next day.First, there was the affair of the
untenanted Kiosk on the Grand Parade.This building belonged to the
Corporation, and 'The Cosy Corner Refreshment Coy.'of which Mr Grinder
was the managing director, was thinking of hiring it to open as a
high-class refreshment lounge, provided the Corporation would make
certain alterations and let the place at a reasonable rent.Another
item which was to be discussed at the Council meeting was Mr Sweater's
generous offer to the Corporation respecting the new drain connecting
'The Cave' with the Town Main.The report of Mr Wireman, the electrical expert, was also to be dealt
with, and afterwards a resolution in favour of the purchase of the
Mugsborough Electric light and Installation Co.Ltd by the town, was to
be proposed.In addition to these matters, several other items, including a proposal
by Mr Didlum for an important reform in the matter of conducting the
meetings of the Council, formed subjects for animated conversation
between the brigands and their host.During this discussion other luminaries arrived, including several
ladies and the Rev.Mr Bosher, of the Church of the Whited Sepulchre.The drawing-room of 'The Cave' was now elaborately furnished.A large
mirror in a richly gilt frame reached from the carved marble
mantelpiece to the cornice.A magnificent clock in an alabaster case
stood in the centre of the mantelpiece and was flanked by two
exquisitely painted and gilded vases of Dresden ware.The windows were
draped with costly hangings, the floor was covered with a luxurious
carpet and expensive rugs.Sumptuously upholstered couches and easy
chairs added to the comfort of the apartment, which was warmed by the
immense fire of coal and oak logs that blazed and crackled in the grate.The conversation now became general and at times highly philosophical
in character, although Mr Bosher did not take much part, being too
busily engaged gobbling up the biscuits and tea, and only occasionally
spluttering out a reply when a remark or question was directly
addressed to him.This was Mr Grinder's first visit at the house, and he expressed his
admiration of the manner in which the ceiling and the walls were
decorated, remarking that he had always liked this 'ere Japanese style.Mr Bosher, with his mouth full of biscuit, mumbled that it was sweetly
pretty--charming--beautifully done--must have cost a lot of money.'Hardly wot you'd call Japanese, though, is it?'observed Didlum,
looking round with the air of a connoisseur.'I should be inclined to
say it was rather more of the--er--Chinese or Egyptian.''Moorish,' explained Mr Sweater with a smile.'I got the idear at the
Paris Exhibition.It's simler to the decorations in the "Halambara",
the palace of the Sultan of Morocco.That clock there is in the same
style.'The case of the clock referred to--which stood on a table in a corner
of the room--was of fretwork, in the form of an Indian Mosque, with a
pointed dome and pinnacles.This was the case that Mary Linden had
sold to Didlum; the latter had had it stained a dark colour and
polished and further improved it by substituting a clock of more
suitable design than the one it originally held.Mr Sweater had
noticed it in Didlum's window and, seeing that the design was similar
in character to the painted decorations on the ceiling and walls of his
drawing-room, had purchased it.'I went to the Paris Exhibition meself,' said Grinder, when everyone
had admired the exquisite workmanship of the clock-case.'I remember
'avin' a look at the moon through that big telescope.I was never so
surprised in me life: you can see it quite plain, and it's round!'You didn't used to think it was square, did yer?''No, of course not, but I always used to think it was flat--like a
plate, but it's round like a football.''Certainly: the moon is a very simler body to the earth,' explained
Didlum, describing an aerial circle with a wave of his hand.They
moves through the air together, but the earth is always nearest to the
sun and consequently once a fortnight the shadder of the earth falls on
the moon and darkens it so that it's invisible to the naked eye.The
new moon is caused by the moon movin' a little bit out of the earth's
shadder, and it keeps on comin' more and more until we gets the full
moon; and then it goes back again into the shadder; and so it keeps on.'For about a minute everyone looked very solemn, and the profound
silence was disturbed only the the crunching of the biscuits between
the jaws of Mr Bosher, and by certain gurglings in the interior of that
gentleman.'Science is a wonderful thing,' said Mr Sweater at length, wagging his
head gravely, 'wonderful!''Yes: but a lot of it is mere theory, you know,' observed Rushton.'Take this idear that the world is round, for instance; I fail to see
it!And then they say as Hawstralia is on the other side of the globe,
underneath our feet.In my opinion it's ridiculous, because if it was
true, wot's to prevent the people droppin' orf?''Yes: well, of course it's very strange,' admitted Sweater.'I've
often thought of that myself.If it was true, we ought to be able to
walk on the ceiling of this room, for instance; but of course we know
that's impossible, and I really don't see that the other is any more
reasonable.''I've often noticed flies walkin' on the ceilin',' remarked Didlum, who
felt called upon to defend the globular theory.'Yes; but they're different,' replied Rushton.'Flies is provided by
nature with a gluey substance which oozes out of their feet for the
purpose of enabling them to walk upside down.''There's one thing that seems to me to finish that idear once for all,'
said Grinder, 'and that is--water always finds its own level.You can't
get away from that; and if the world was round, as they want us to
believe, all the water would run off except just a little at the top.To my mind, that settles the whole argymint.''Another thing that gets over me,' continued Rushton, 'is this:
according to science, the earth turns round on its axle at the rate of
twenty miles a minit.Well, what about when a lark goes up in the sky
and stays there about a quarter of an hour?Why, if it was true that
the earth was turnin' round at that rate all the time, when the bird
came down it would find itself 'undreds of miles away from the place
where it went up from!But that doesn't 'appen at all; the bird always
comes down in the same spot.''Yes, and the same thing applies to balloons and flyin' machines,' said
Grinder.'If it was true that the world is spinnin' round on its axle
so quick as that, if a man started out from Calais to fly to Dover, by
the time he got to England he'd find 'imself in North America, or
p'r'aps farther off still.''And if it was true that the world goes round the sun at the rate they
makes out, when a balloon went up, the earth would run away from it!They'd never be able to get back again!'This was so obvious that nearly everyone said there was probably
something in it, and Didlum could think of no reply.Mr Bosher upon
being appealed to for his opinion, explained that science was alright
in its way, but unreliable: the things scientists said yesterday they
contradicted today, and what they said today they would probably
repudiate tomorrow.It was necessary to be very cautious before
accepting any of their assertions.'Talking about science,' said Grinder, as the holy man relapsed into
silence and started on another biscuit and a fresh cup of tea.'Talking
about science reminds me of a conversation I 'ad with Dr Weakling the
other day.You know, he believes we're all descended from monkeys.'Everyone laughed; the thing was so absurd: the idea of placing
intellectual beings on a level with animals!'But just wait till you hear how nicely I flattened 'im out,' continued
Grinder.'After we'd been arguin' a long time about wot 'e called
everlution or some sich name, and a lot more tommy-rot that I couldn't
make no 'ead or tail of--and to tell you the truth I don't believe 'e
understood 'arf of it 'imself--I ses to 'im, "Well," I ses, "if it's
true that we're hall descended from monkeys," I ses, "I think your
famly must 'ave left orf where mine begun."'In the midst of the laughter that greeted the conclusion of Grinder's
story it was seen that Mr Bosher had become black in the face.He was
waving his arms and writhing about like one in a fit, his goggle eyes
bursting from their sockets, whilst his huge stomach quivering
spasmodically, alternately contracted and expanded as if it were about
to explode.In the exuberance of his mirth, the unfortunate disciple had swallowed
two biscuits at once.Everybody rushed to his assistance, Grinder and
Didlum seized an arm and a shoulder each and forced his head down.Rushton punched him in the back and the ladies shrieked with alarm.They gave him a big drink of tea to help to get the biscuits down, and
when he at last succeeded in swallowing them he sat in the armchair
with his eyes red-rimmed and full of tears, which ran down over his
white, flabby face.The arrival of the other members of the committee put an end to the
interesting discussion, and they shortly afterwards proceeded with the
business for which the meeting had been called--the arrangements for
the forthcoming Rummage Sale.Chapter 39

The Brigands at Work


The next day, at the meeting of the Town Council, Mr Wireman's report
concerning the Electric Light Works was read.The expert's opinion was
so favourable--and it was endorsed by the Borough Engineer, Mr Oyley
Sweater--that a resolution was unanimously carried in favour of
acquiring the Works for the town, and a secret committee was appointed
to arrange the preliminaries.Alderman Sweater then suggested that a
suitable honorarium be voted to Mr Wireman for his services.This was
greeted with a murmur of approval from most of the members, and Mr
Didlum rose with the intention of proposing a resolution to that effect
when he was interrupted by Alderman Grinder, who said he couldn't see
no sense in giving the man a thing like that.'Why not give him a sum
of money?'Several members said 'Hear, hear,' to this, but some of the others
laughed.'I can't see nothing to laugh at,' cried Grinder angrily.'For my part
I wouldn't give you tuppence for all the honorariums in the country.I
move that we pay 'im a sum of money.''I'll second that,' said another member of the Band--one of those who
had cried 'Hear, Hear.'Alderman Sweater said that there seemed to be a little misunderstanding
and explained that an honorarium WAS a sum of money.'Oh, well, in that case I'll withdraw my resolution,' said Grinder.'I
thought you wanted to give 'im a 'luminated address or something like
that.'Didlum now moved that a letter of thanks and a fee of fifty guineas be
voted to Mr Wireman, and this was also unanimously agreed to.Dr
Weakling said that it seemed rather a lot, but he did not go so far as
to vote against it.The next business was the proposal that the Corporation should take
over the drain connecting Mr Sweater's house with the town main.Mr
Sweater--being a public-spirited man--proposed to hand this connecting
drain--which ran through a private road--over to the Corporation to be
theirs and their successors for ever, on condition that they would pay
him the cost of construction--L55--and agreed to keep it in proper
repair.After a brief discussion it was decided to take over the drain
on the terms offered, and then Councillor Didlum proposed a vote of
thanks to Alderman Sweater for his generosity in the matter: this was
promptly seconded by Councillor Rushton and would have been carried
nem.con., but for the disgraceful conduct of Dr Weakling, who had the
bad taste to suggest that the amount was about double what the drain
could possibly have cost to construct, that it was of no use to the
Corporation at all, and that they would merely acquire the liability to
keep it in repair.However, no one took the trouble to reply to Weakling, and the Band
proceeded to the consideration of the next business, which was Mr
Grinder's offer--on behalf of the 'Cosy Corner Refreshment Company'--to
take the Kiosk on the Grand Parade.Mr Grinder submitted a plan of
certain alterations that he would require the Corporation to make at
the Kiosk, and, provided the Council agreed to do this work he was
willing to take a lease of the place for five years at L20 per year.Councillor Didlum proposed that the offer of the 'Cosy Corner
Refreshment Co.Ltd' be accepted and the required alterations proceeded
with at once.The Kiosk had brought in no rent for nearly two years,
but, apart from that consideration, if they accepted this offer they
would be able to set some of the unemployed to work.Dr Weakling pointed out that as the proposed alterations would cost
about L175--according to the estimate of the Borough Engineer--and, the
rent being only L20 a year, it would mean that the Council would be L75
out of pocket at the end of the five years; to say nothing of the
expense of keeping the place in repair during all that time.He moved as an amendment that the alterations be made,
and that they then invite tenders, and let the place to the highest
bidder.Councillor Rushton said he was disgusted with the attitude taken up by
that man Weakling.Perhaps it was hardly right to call
him a man.In the matter of these alterations they had
had the use of Councillor Grinder's brains: it was he who first thought
of making these improvements in the Kiosk, and therefore he--or rather
the company he represented--had a moral right to the tenancy.Dr Weakling said that he thought it was understood that when a man was
elected to that Council it was because he was supposed to be willing to
use his brains for the benefit of his constituents.The Mayor asked if there was any seconder to Weakling's amendment, and
as there was not the original proposition was put and carried.Councillor Rushton suggested that a large shelter with seating
accommodation for about two hundred persons should be erected on the
Grand Parade near the Kiosk.The shelter would serve as a protection
against rain, or the rays of the sun in summer.It would add
materially to the comfort of visitors and would be a notable addition
to the attractions of the town.Councillor Didlum said it was a very good idear, and proposed that the
Surveyor be instructed to get out the plans.It seemed to him that the
object was to benefit, not the town, but Mr Grinder.If
this shelter were erected, it would increase the value of the Kiosk as
a refreshment bar by a hundred per cent.If Mr Grinder wanted a
shelter for his customers he should pay for it himself.He
(Dr Weakling) was sorry to have to say it, but he could not help
thinking that this was a Put-up job.(Loud cries of 'Withdraw'
'Apologize' 'Cast 'im out' and terrific uproar.)Weakling did not apologize or withdraw, but he said no more.Didlum's
proposition was carried, and the 'Band' went on to the next item on the
agenda, which was a proposal by Councillor Didlum to increase the
salary of Mr Oyley Sweater, the Borough Engineer, from fifteen pounds
to seventeen pounds per week.Councillor Didlum said that when they had a good man they ought to
appreciate him.Compared with other officials, the
Borough Engineer was not fairly paid.The magistrates'
clerk received seventeen pounds a week.The Town Clerk seventeen
pounds per week.He did not wish it to be understood that he thought
those gentlemen were overpaid--far from it.It was not
that they got too much but that the Engineer got too little.How could
they expect a man like that to exist on a paltry fifteen pounds a week?Why, it was nothing more or less than sweating!He had
much pleasure in moving that the Borough Engineer's salary be increased
to seventeen pounds a week, and that his annual holiday be extended
from a fortnight to one calendar month with hard la--he begged
pardon--with full pay.Councillor Rushton said that he did not propose to make a long
speech--it was not necessary.He would content himself with formally
seconding Councillor Didlum's excellent proposition.Councillor Weakling, whose rising was greeted with derisive laughter,
said he must oppose the resolution.He wished it to be understood that
he was not actuated by any feeling of personal animosity towards the
Borough Engineer, but at the same time he considered it his duty to say
that in his (Dr Weakling's) opinion, that official would be dear at
half the price they were now paying him.He did not
appear to understand his business, nearly all the work that was done
cost in the end about double what the Borough Engineer estimated it
could be done for.He considered him to be a grossly
incompetent person (uproar) and was of opinion that if they were to
advertise they could get dozens of better men who would be glad to do
the work for five pounds a week.He moved that Mr Oyley Sweater be
asked to resign and that they advertise for a man at five pounds a
week.Councillor Grinder rose to a point of order.He appealed to the
Chairman to squash the amendment.Councillor Didlum remarked that he supposed Councillor Grinder meant
'quash': in that case, he would support the suggestion.Councillor Grinder said it was about time they put a stopper on that
feller Weakling.He (Grinder) did not care whether they called it
squashing or quashing; it was all the same so long as they nipped him
in the bud.The man was a disgrace to the Council; always
interfering and hindering the business.The Mayor--Alderman Sweater--said that he did not think it consistent
with the dignity of that Council to waste any more time over this
scurrilous amendment.He was proud to say that it had
never even been seconded, and therefore he would put Mr Didlum's
resolution--a proposition which he had no hesitation in saying
reflected the highest credit upon that gentleman and upon all those who
supported it.All those who were in favour signified their approval in the customary
manner, and as Weakling was the only one opposed, the resolution was
carried and the meeting proceeded to the next business.Councillor Rushton said that several influential ratepayers and
employers of labour had complained to him about the high wages of the
Corporation workmen, some of whom were paid sevenpence-halfpenny an
hour.Sevenpence an hour was the maximum wage paid to skilled workmen
by private employers in that town, and he failed to see why the
Corporation should pay more.It had a very bad effect
on the minds of the men in the employment of private firms, tending to
make them dissatisfied with their wages.The same state of affairs
prevailed with regard to the unskilled labourers in the Council's
employment.Private employers could get that class of labour for
fourpence-halfpenny or fivepence an hour, and yet the corporation paid
fivepence-halfpenny and even sixpence for the same class of work.Considering
that the men in the employment of the Corporation had almost constant
work, if there was to be a difference at all, they should get not more,
but less, than those who worked for private firms.He moved
that the wages of the Corporation workmen be reduced in all cases to
the same level as those paid by private firms.He said it amounted to a positive
scandal.Why, in the summer-time some of these men drew as much as
35/- in a single week!and it was quite common for unskilled
labourers--fellers who did nothing but the very hardest and most
laborious work, sich as carrying sacks of cement, or digging up the
roads to get at the drains, and sich-like easy jobs--to walk off with
25/- a week!He had often noticed some of these men
swaggering about the town on Sundays, dressed like millionaires and
cigared up!They seemed quite a different class of men from those who
worked for private firms, and to look at the way some of their children
was dressed you'd think their fathers was Cabinet Minstrels!No wonder
the ratepayers complained ot the high rates.Another grievance was
that all the Corporation workmen were allowed two days' holiday every
year, in addition to the Bank Holidays, and were paid for them!(Cries
of'shame', 'Scandalous', 'Disgraceful', etc.)No private contractor
paid his men for Bank Holidays, and why should the Corporation do so?He had much pleasure in seconding Councillor Rushton's resolution.He thought that 35/- a week was
little enough for a man to keep a wife and family with (Rot), even if
all the men got it regularly, which they did not.Members should
consider what was the average amount per week throughout the whole
year, not merely the busy time, and if they did that they would find
that even the skilled men did not average more than 25/- a week, and in
many cases not so much.If this subject had not been introduced by
Councillor Rushton, he (Dr Weakling) had intended to propose that the
wages of the Corporation workmen should be increased to the standard
recognized by the Trades Unions.It had been proved
that the notoriously short lives of the working people--whose average
span of life was about twenty years less than that of the well-to-do
classes--their increasingly inferior physique, and the high rate of
mortality amongst their children was caused by the wretched
remuneration they received for hard and tiring work, the excessive
number of hours they have to work, when employed, the bad quality of
their food, the badly constructed and insanitary homes their poverty
compels them to occupy, and the anxiety, worry, and depression of mind
they have to suffer when out of employment.(Cries of 'Rot', 'Bosh',
and loud laughter.)Councillor Didlum said, 'Rot'.It was a very good
word to describe the disease that was sapping the foundations of
society and destroying the health and happiness and the very lives of
so many of their fellow countrymen and women.(Renewed merriment and
shouts of 'Go and buy a red tie.')He appealed to the members to
reject the resolution.He was very glad to say that he believed it was
true that the workmen in the employ of the Corporation were a little
better off than those in the employ of private contractors, and if it
were so, it was as it should be.They had need to be better off than
the poverty-stricken, half-starved poor wretches who worked for private
firms.Councillor Didlum said that it was very evident that Dr Weakling had
obtained his seat on that Council by false pretences.If he had told
the ratepayers that he was a Socialist, they would never have elected
him.Practically every Christian minister in the
country would agree with him (Didlum) when he said that the poverty of
the working classes was caused not by the 'wretched remuneration they
receive as wages', but by Drink.And he was very
sure that the testimony of the clergy of all denominations was more to
be relied upon than the opinion of a man like Dr Weakling.Dr Weakling said that if some of the clergymen referred to or some of
the members of the council had to exist and toil amid the same sordid
surroundings, overcrowding and ignorance as some of the working
classes, they would probably seek to secure some share of pleasure and
forgetfulness in drink themselves!(Great uproar and shouts of
'Order', 'Withdraw', 'Apologize'.)Councillor Grinder said that even if it was true that the haverage
lives of the working classes was twenty years shorter than those of the
better classes, he could not see what it had got to do with Dr
Weakling.So long as the working class was contented to
die twenty years before their time, he failed to see what it had got to
do with other people.They was not runnin' short of workers, was they?So long as the
workin' class was satisfied to die orf--let 'em die orf!The workin' class adn't arst Dr Weakling to
stick up for them, had they?If they wasn't satisfied, they would
stick up for theirselves!The working men didn't want the likes of Dr
Weakling to stick up for them, and they would let 'im know it when the
next election came round.If he (Grinder) was a wordly man, he would
not mind betting that the workin' men of Dr Weakling's ward would give
him 'the dirty kick out' next November.Councillor Weakling, who knew that this was probably true, made no
further protest.Rushton's proposition was carried, and then the Clerk
announced that the next item was the resolution Mr Didlum had given
notice of at the last meeting, and the Mayor accordingly called upon
that gentleman.Councillor Didlum, who was received with loud cheers, said that
unfortunately a certain member of that Council seemed to think he had a
right to oppose nearly everything that was brought forward.(The majority of the members of the Band glared malignantly at
Weakling.)He hoped that for once the individual he referred to would have the
decency to restrain himself, because the resolution he (Didlum) was
about to have the honour of proposing was one that he believed no
right-minded man--no matter what his politics or religious
opinions--could possibly object to; and he trusted that for the credit
of the Council it would be entered on the records as an unopposed
motion.The resolution was as follows:

'That from this date all the meetings of this Council shall be opened
with prayer and closed with the singing of the Doxology.'Councillor Rushton seconded the resolution, which was also supported by
Mr Grinder, who said that at a time like the present, when there was
sich a lot of infiddles about who said that we all came from monkeys,
the Council would be showing a good example to the working classes by
adopting the resolution.Councillor Weakling said nothing, so the new rule was carried nem.con., and as there was no more business to be done it was put into
operation for the first time there and then.Mr Sweater conducting the
singing with a roll of paper--the plan of the drain of 'The Cave'--and
each member singing a different tune.Weakling withdrew during the singing, and afterwards, before the Band
dispersed, it was agreed that a certain number of them were to meet the
Chief at the Cave, on the following evening to arrange the details of
the proposed raid on the finances of the town in connection with the
sale of the Electric Light Works.The alterations which the Corporation had undertaken to make in the
Kiosk on the Grand Parade provided employment for several carpenters
and plasterers for about three weeks, and afterwards for several
painters.This fact was sufficient to secure the working men's
unqualified approval of the action of the Council in letting the place
to Grinder, and Councillor Weakling's opposition--the reasons of which
they did not take the trouble to inquire into or understand--they as
heartily condemned.All they knew or cared was that he had tried to
prevent the work being done, and that he had referred in insulting
terms to the working men of the town.What right had he to call them
half-starved, poverty-stricken, poor wretches?If it came to being
poverty-stricken, according to all accounts, he wasn't any too well orf
hisself.Some of those blokes who went swaggering about in frock-coats
and pot-'ats was just as 'ard up as anyone else if the truth was known.As for the Corporation workmen, it was quite right that their wages
should be reduced.Why should they get more money than anyone else?'It's us what's got to find the money,' they said.'We're the
ratepayers, and why should we have to pay them more wages than we get
ourselves?And why should they be paid for holidays any more than us?'During the next few weeks the dearth of employment continued, for, of
course, the work at the Kiosk and the few others jobs that were being
done did not make much difference to the general situation.Groups of
workmen stood at the corners or walked aimlessly about the streets.Most of them no longer troubled to go to the different firms to ask for
work, they were usually told that they would be sent for if wanted.During this time Owen did his best to convert the other men to his
views.He had accumulated a little library of Socialist books and
pamphlets which he lent to those he hoped to influence.Some of them
took these books and promised, with the air of men who were conferring
a great favour, that they would read them.As a rule, when they
returned them it was with vague expressions of approval, but they
usually evinced a disinclination to discuss the contents in detail
because, in nine instances out of ten, they had not attempted to read
them.As for those who did make a half-hearted effort to do so, in the
majority of cases their minds were so rusty and stultified by long
years of disuse, that, although the pamphlets were generally written in
such simple language that a child might have understood, the argument
was generally too obscure to be grasped by men whose minds were addled
by the stories told them by their Liberal and Tory masters.Some, when
Owen offered to lend them some books or pamphlets refused to accept
them, and others who did him the great favour of accepting them,
afterwards boasted that they had used them as toilet paper.Owen frequently entered into long arguments with the other men, saying
that it was the duty of the State to provide productive work for all
those who were willing to do it.Some few of them listened like men
who only vaguely understood, but were willing to be convinced.It's right enough what you say,' they would remark.Others ridiculed this doctrine of State employment: It was all very
fine, but where was the money to come from?And then those who had
been disposed to agree with Owen could relapse into their old apathy.There were others who did not listen so quietly, but shouted with many
curses that it was the likes of such fellows as Owen who were
responsible for all the depression in trade.All this talk about
Socialism and State employment was frightening Capital out of the
country.Those who had money were afraid to invest it in industries,
or to have any work done for fear they would be robbed.When Owen
quoted statistics to prove that as far as commerce and the quantity
produced of commodities of all kinds was concerned, the last year had
been a record one, they became more infuriated than ever, and talked
threateningly of what they would like to do to those bloody Socialists
who were upsetting everything.One day Crass, who was one of these upholders of the existing system,
scored off Owen finely.A little group of them were standing talking
in the Wage Slave Market near the Fountain.In the course of the
argument, Owen made the remark that under existing conditions life was
not worth living, and Crass said that if he really thought so, there
was no compulsion about it; if he wasn't satisfied--if he didn't want
to live--he could go and die.Why the hell didn't he go and make a
hole in the water, or cut his bloody throat?On this particular occasion the subject of the argument was--at
first--the recent increase of the Borough Engineer's salary to
seventeen pounds per week.Owen had said it was robbery, but the
majority of the others expressed their approval of the increase.They
asked Owen if he expected a man like that to work for nothing!It was
not as if he were one of the likes of themselves.They said that, as
for it being robbery, Owen would be very glad to have the chance of
getting it himself.Most of them seemed to think the fact that anyone
would be glad to have seventeen pounds a week, proved that it was right
for them to pay that amount to the Borough Engineer!Usually whenever Owen reflected upon the gross injustices, and
inhumanity of the existing social disorder, he became convinced that it
could not possibly last; it was bound to fall to pieces because of its
own rottenness.It was not just, it was not common sense, and
therefore it could not endure.But always after one of these
arguments--or, rather, disputes--with his fellow workmen, he almost
relapsed into hopelessness and despondency, for then he realized how
vast and how strong are the fortifications that surround the present
system; the great barriers and ramparts of invincible ignorance, apathy
and self-contempt, which will have to be broken down before the system
of society of which they are the defences, can be swept away.At other times as he thought of this marvellous system, it presented
itself to him in such an aspect of almost comical absurdity that he was
forced to laugh and to wonder whether it really existed at all, or if
it were only an illusion of his own disordered mind.One of the things that the human race needed in order to exist was
shelter; so with much painful labour they had constructed a large
number of houses.Thousands of these houses were now standing
unoccupied, while millions of the people who had helped to build the
houses were either homeless or herding together in overcrowded hovels.These human beings had such a strange system of arranging their affairs
that if anyone were to go and burn down a lot of the houses he would be
conferring a great boon upon those who had built them, because such an
act would 'Make a lot more work!'Another very comical thing was that thousands of people wore broken
boots and ragged clothes, while millions of pairs of boots and
abundance of clothing, which they had helped to make, were locked up in
warehouses, and the System had the keys.Thousands of people lacked the necessaries of life.The necessaries of
life are all produced by work.The people who lacked begged to be
allowed to work and create those things of which they stood in need.If anyone asked the System why it prevented these people from producing
the things of which they were in want, the System replied:

'Because they have already produced too much.The warehouses are filled and overflowing, and there is nothing more
for them to do.'There was in existence a huge accumulation of everything necessary.A
great number of the people whose labour had produced that vast store
were now living in want, but the System said that they could not be
permitted to partake of the things they had created.Then, after a
time, when these people, being reduced to the last extreme of misery,
cried out that they and their children were dying of hunger, the System
grudgingly unlocked the doors of the great warehouses, and taking out a
small part of the things that were stored within, distributed it
amongst the famished workers, at the same time reminding them that it
was Charity, because all the things in the warehouses, although they
had been made by the workers, were now the property of the people who
do nothing.And then the starving, bootless, ragged, stupid wretches fell down and
worshipped the System, and offered up their children as living
sacrifices upon its altars, saying:

'This beautiful System is the only one possible, and the best that
human wisdom can devise.Cursed be
those who seek to destroy the System!'As the absurdity of the thing forced itself upon him, Owen, in spite of
the unhappiness he felt at the sight of all the misery by which he was
surrounded, laughed aloud and said to himself that if he was sane, then
all these people must be mad.In the face of such colossal imbecility it was absurd to hope for any
immediate improvement.The little already accomplished was the work of
a few self-sacrificing enthusiasts, battling against the opposition of
those they sought to benefit, and the results of their labours were, in
many instances, as pearls cast before the swine who stood watching for
opportunities to fall upon and rend their benefactors.It was possible that the monopolists,
encouraged by the extraordinary stupidity and apathy of the people
would proceed to lay upon them even greater burdens, until at last,
goaded by suffering, and not having sufficient intelligence to
understand any other remedy, these miserable wretches would turn upon
their oppressors and drown both them and their System in a sea of blood.Besides the work at the Kiosk, towards the end of March things
gradually began to improve in other directions.Several firms began to
take on a few hands.Several large empty houses that were relet had to
be renovated for their new tenants, and there was a fair amount of
inside work arising out of the annual spring-cleaning in other houses.There was not enough work to keep everyone employed, and most of those
who were taken on as a rule only managed to make a few hours a week,
but still it was better than absolute idleness, and there also began to
be talk of several large outside jobs that were to be done as soon as
the weather was settled.This bad weather, by the way, was a sort of boon to the defenders of
the present system, who were hard-up for sensible arguments to explain
the cause of poverty.One of the principal causes was, of course, the
weather, which was keeping everything back.There was not the
slightest doubt that if only the weather would allow there would always
be plenty of work, and poverty would be abolished.had a fair share of what work there was, and Crass,
Sawkins, Slyme and Owen were kept employed pretty regularly, although
they did not start until half past eight and left off at four.At
different houses in various parts of the town they had ceilings to wash
off and distemper, to strip the old paper from the walls, and to
repaint and paper the rooms, and sometimes there were the venetian
blinds to repair and repaint.Occasionally a few extra hands were
taken on for a few days, and discharged again as soon as the job they
were taken on to do was finished.The defenders of the existing system may possibly believe that the
knowledge that they would be discharged directly the job was done was a
very good incentive to industry, that they would naturally under these
circumstances do their best to get the work done as quickly as
possible.But then it must be remembered that most of the defenders of
the existing system are so constituted, that they can believe anything
provided it is not true and sufficiently silly.All the same, it was a fact that the workmen did do their very best to
get over this work in the shortest possible time, because although they
knew that to do so was contrary to their own interests, they also knew
that it would be very much more contrary to their interests not to do
so.Their only chance of being kept on if other work came in was to
tear into it for all they were worth.Consequently, most of the work
was rushed and botched and slobbered over in about half the time that
it would have taken to do it properly.Rooms for which the customers
paid to have three coats of paint were scamped with one or two.What
Misery did not know about scamping and faking the work, the men
suggested to and showed him in the hope of currying favour with him in
order that they might get the preference over others and be sent for
when the next job came in.This is the principal incentive provided by
the present system, the incentive to cheat.These fellows cheated the
customers of their money.They cheated themselves and their fellow
workmen of work, and their children of bread, but it was all for a good
cause--to make profit for their master.Harlow and Slyme did one job--a room that Rushton & Co.It was finished with two and the men cleared
away their paints.The next day, when Slyme went there to paper the
room, the lady of the house said that the painting was not yet
finished--it was to have another coat.Slyme assured her that it had
already had three, but, as the lady insisted, Slyme went to the shop
and sought out Misery.Harlow had been stood off, as there was not
another job in just then, but fortunately he happened to be standing in
the street outside the shop, so they called him and then the three of
them went round to the job and swore that the room had had three coats.She had watched the progress of
the work.Besides, it was impossible; they had only been there three
days.The first day they had not put any paint on at all; they had
done the ceiling and stripped the walls; the painting was not started
till the second day.Misery
explained the mystery: he said that for first coating they had an extra
special very fast-drying paint--paint that dried so quickly that they
were able to give the work two coats in one day.For instance, one man
did the window, the other the door: when these were finished both men
did the skirting; by the time the skirting was finished the door and
window were dry enough to second coat; and then, on the following
day--the finishing coat!Of course, this extra special quick-drying paint was very expensive,
but the firm did not mind that.They knew that most of their customers
wished to have their work finished as quickly as possible, and their
study was to give satisfaction to the customers.This explanation
satisfied the lady--a poverty-stricken widow making a precarious living
by taking in lodgers--who was the more easily deceived because she
regarded Misery as a very holy man, having seen him preaching in the
street on many occasions.There was another job at another boarding-house that Owen and Easton
did--two rooms which had to be painted three coats of white paint and
one of enamel, making four coats altogether.That was what the firm
had contracted to do.As the old paint in these rooms was of a rather
dark shade it was absolutely necessary to give the work three coats
before enamelling it.Misery wanted them to let it go with two, but
Owen pointed out that if they did so it would be such a ghastly mess
that it would never pass.After thinking the matter over for a few
minutes, Misery told them to go on with the third coat of paint.Then
he went downstairs and asked to see the lady of the house.He
explained to her that, in consequence of the old paint being so dark,
he found that it would be necessary, in order to make a good job of it,
to give the work four coats before enamelling it.Of course, they had
agreed for only three, but as they always made a point of doing their
work in a first-class manner rather than not make a good job, they
would give it the extra coat for nothing, but he was sure she would not
wish them to do that.The lady said that she did not want them to work
for nothing, and she wanted it done properly.If it were necessary to
give it an extra coat, they must do so and she would pay for it.The lady was satisfied, and Misery
was in the seventh heaven.Then he went upstairs again and warned Owen
and Easton to be sure to say, if they were asked, that the work had had
four coats.It would not be reasonable to blame Misery or Rushton for not wishing
to do good, honest work--there was no incentive.When they secured a
contract, if they had thought first of making the very best possible
job of it, they would not have made so much profit.The incentive was
not to do the work as well as possible, but to do as little as
possible.The incentive was not to make good work, but to make good
profit.They could not justly be blamed
for not doing good work--there was no incentive.To do good work
requires time and pains.Most of them would have liked to take time
and pains, because all those who are capable of doing good work find
pleasure and happiness in doing it, and have pride in it when done: but
there was no incentive, unless the certainty of getting the sack could
be called an incentive, for it was a moral certainty that any man who
was caught taking time and pains with his work would be promptly
presented with the order of the boot.But there was plenty of
incentive to hurry and scamp and slobber and botch.There was another job at a lodging-house--two rooms to be painted and
papered.The landlord paid for the work, but the tenant had the
privilege of choosing the paper.She could have any pattern she liked
so long as the cost did not exceed one shilling per roll, Rushton's
estimate being for paper of that price.Misery sent her several
patterns of sixpenny papers, marked at a shilling, to choose from, but
she did not fancy any of them, and said that she would come to the shop
to make her selection.So Hunter tore round to the shop in a great
hurry to get there before her.In his haste to dismount, he fell off
his bicycle into the muddy road, and nearly smashed the plate-glass
window with the handle-bar of the machine as he placed it against the
shop front before going in.Without waiting to clean the mud off his clothes, he ordered Budd, the
pimply-faced shopman, to get out rolls of all the sixpenny papers they
had, and then they both set to work and altered the price marked upon
them from sixpence to a shilling.Then they got out a number of
shilling papers and altered the price marked upon them, changing it
from a shilling to one and six.When the unfortunate woman arrived, Misery was waiting for her with a
benign smile upon his long visage.He showed her all the sixpenny
ones, but she did not like any of them, so after a while Nimrod
suggested that perhaps she would like a paper of a little better
quality, and she could pay the trifling difference out of her own
pocket.Then he showed her the shilling papers that he had marked up
to one and sixpence, and eventually the lady selected one of these and
paid the extra sixpence per roll herself, as Nimrod suggested.There
were fifteen rolls of paper altogether--seven for one room and eight
for the other--so that in addition to the ordinary profit on the sale
of the paper--about two hundred and seventy-five per cent.--the firm
made seven and sixpence on this transaction.They might have done
better out of the job itself if Slyme had not been hanging the paper
piece-work, for, the two rooms being of the same pattern, he could
easily have managed to do them with fourteen rolls; in fact, that was
all he did use, but he cut up and partly destroyed the one that was
over so that he could charge for hanging it.Owen was working there at the same time, for the painting of the rooms
was not done before Slyme papered them; the finishing coat was put on
after the paper was hung.He noticed Slyme destroying the paper and,
guessing the reason, asked him how he could reconcile such conduct as
that with his profession of religion.Slyme replied that the fact that he was a Christian did not imply that
he never did anything wrong: if he committed a sin, he was a Christian
all the same, and it would be forgiven him for the sake of the Blood.As for this affair of the paper, it was a matter between himself and
God, and Owen had no right to set himself up as a Judge.In addition to all this work, there were a number of funerals.Crass
and Slyme did very well out of it all, working all day white-washing or
painting, and sometimes part of the night painting venetian blinds or
polishing coffins and taking them home, to say nothing of the lifting
in of the corpses and afterwards acting as bearers.As time went on, the number of small jobs increased, and as the days
grew longer the men were allowed to put in a greater number of hours.Most of the firms had some work, but there was never enough to keep all
the men in the town employed at the same time.It worked like this:
Every firm had a certain number of men who were regarded as the regular
hands.When there was any work to do, they got the preference over
strangers or outsiders.When things were busy, outsiders were taken on
temporarily.When the work fell off, these casual hands were the first
to be'stood still'.If it continued to fall off, the old hands were
also stood still in order of seniority, the older hands being preferred
to strangers--so long, of course, as they were not old in the sense of
being aged or inefficient.This kind of thing usually continued all through the spring and summer.In good years the men of all trades, carpenters, bricklayers,
plasterers, painters and so on, were able to keep almost regularly at
work, except in wet weather.The difference between a good and bad spring and summer is that in good
years it is sometimes possible to make a little overtime, and the
periods of unemployment are shorter and less frequent than in bad
years.It is rare even in good years for one of the casual hands to be
employed by one firm for more than one, two or three months without a
break.It is usual for them to put in a month with one firm, then a
fortnight with another, then perhaps six weeks somewhere else, and
often between there are two or three days or even weeks of enforced
idleness.This sort of thing goes on all through spring, summer and
autumn.The Beano Meeting


By the beginning of April, Rushton & Co.were again working nine hours
a day, from seven in the morning till five-thirty at night, and after
Easter they started working full time from 6 A.M.till 5.30 P.M.,
eleven and a half hours--or, rather, ten hours, for they had to lose
half an hour at breakfast and an hour at dinner.Just before Easter several of the men asked Hunter if they might be
allowed to work on Good Friday and Easter Monday, as, they said, they
had had enough holidays during the winter; they had no money to spare
for holiday-making, and they did not wish to lose two days' pay when
there was work to be done.Hunter told them that there was not
sufficient work in to justify him in doing as they requested: things
were getting very slack again, and Mr Rushton had decided to cease work
from Thursday night till Tuesday morning.They were thus prevented
from working on Good Friday, but it is true that not more than one
working man in fifty went to any religious service on that day or on
any other day during the Easter festival.On the contrary, this
festival was the occasion of much cursing and blaspheming on the part
of those whose penniless, poverty-stricken condition it helped to
aggravate by enforcing unprofitable idleness which they lacked the
means to enjoy.During these holidays some of the men did little jobs on their own
account and others put in the whole time--including Good Friday and
Easter Sunday--gardening, digging and planting their plots of allotment
ground.When Owen arrived home one evening during the week before Easter,
Frankie gave him an envelope which he had brought home from school.It
contained a printed leaflet:

                   CHURCH OF THE WHITED SEPULCHRE,
                             MUGSBOROUGH

                             Easter 19--

Dear Sir (or Madam),

In accordance with the usual custom we invite you to join with us in
presenting the Vicar, the Rev.Habbakuk Bosher, with an Easter
Offering, as a token of affection and regard.Yours faithfully,
                          A. Cheeseman }
                          W. Taylor    }  Churchwardens

Mr Bosher's income from various sources connected with the church was
over six hundred pounds a year, or about twelve pounds per week, but as
that sum was evidently insufficient, his admirers had adopted this
device for supplementing it.Frankie said all the boys had one of
these letters and were going to ask their fathers for some money to
give towards the Easter offering.Most of them expected to get
twopence.As the boy had evidently set his heart on doing the same as the other
children, Owen gave him the twopence, and they afterwards learned that
the Easter Offering for that year was one hundred and twenty-seven
pounds, which was made up of the amounts collected from the
parishioners by the children, the district visitors and the verger, the
collection at a special Service, and donations from the feeble-minded
old females elsewhere referred to.By the end of April nearly all the old hands were back at work, and
several casual hands had also been taken on, the Semi-drunk being one
of the number.In addition to these, Misery had taken on a number of
what he called 'lightweights', men who were not really skilled workmen,
but had picked up sufficient knowledge of the simpler parts of the
trade to be able to get over it passably.These were paid fivepence or
fivepence-halfpenny, and were employed in preference to those who had
served their time, because the latter wanted more money and therefore
were only employed when absolutely necessary.Besides the lightweights
there were a few young fellows called improvers, who were also employed
because they were cheap.Crass now acted as colourman, having been appointed possibly because he
knew absolutely nothing about the laws of colour.As most of the work
consisted of small jobs, all the paint and distemper was mixed up at
the shop and sent out ready for use to the various jobs.Sawkins or some of the other lightweights generally carried the heavier
lots of colour or scaffolding, but the smaller lots of colour or such
things as a pair of steps or a painter's plank were usually sent by the
boy, whose slender legs had become quite bowed since he had been
engaged helping the other philanthropists to make money for Mr Rushton.Crass's work as colourman was simplified, to a certain extent, by the
great number of specially prepared paints and distempers in all
colours, supplied by the manufacturers ready for use.Most of these
new-fangled concoctions were regarded with an eye of suspicion and
dislike by the hands, and Philpot voiced the general opinion about them
one day during a dinner-hour discussion when he said they might appear
to be all right for a time, but they would probably not last, because
they was mostly made of kimicles.One of these new-fashioned paints was called 'Petrifying Liquid', and
was used for first-coating decaying stone or plaster work.It was also
supposed to be used for thinning up a certain kind of patent distemper,
but when Misery found out that it was possible to thin the latter with
water, the use of 'Petrifying Liquid' for that purpose was
discontinued.This 'Petrifying Liquid' was a source of much merriment
to the hands.The name was applied to the tea that they made in
buckets on some of the jobs, and also to the four-ale that was supplied
by certain pubs.One of the new inventions was regarded with a certain amount of
indignation by the hands: it was a white enamel, and they objected to
it for two reasons--one was because, as Philpot remarked, it dried so
quickly that you had to work like greased lightning; you had to be all
over the door directly you started it.The other reason was that, because it dried so quickly, it was
necessary to keep closed the doors and windows of the room where it was
being used, and the smell was so awful that it brought on fits of
dizziness and sometimes vomiting.Needless to say, the fact that it
compelled those who used it to work quickly recommended the stuff to
Misery.As for the smell, he did not care about that; he did not have to inhale
the fumes himself.It was just about this time that Crass, after due consultation with
several of the others, including Philpot, Harlow, Bundy, Slyme, Easton
and the Semi-drunk, decided to call a meeting of the hands for the
purpose of considering the advisability of holding the usual Beano
later on in the summer.The meeting was held in the carpenter's shop
down at the yard one evening at six o'clock, which allowed time for
those interested to attend after leaving work.The hands sat on the benches or carpenter's stools, or reclined upon
heaps of shavings.On a pair of tressels in the centre of the workshop
stood a large oak coffin which Crass had just finished polishing.When all those who were expected to turn up had arrived, Payne, the
foreman carpenter--the man who made the coffins--was voted to the chair
on the proposition of Crass, seconded by Philpot, and then a solemn
silence ensued, which was broken at last by the chairman, who, in a
lengthy speech, explained the object of the meeting.Possibly with a
laudable desire that there should be no mistake about it, he took the
trouble to explain several times, going over the same ground and
repeating the same words over and over again, whilst the audience
waited in a deathlike and miserable silence for him to leave off.Payne, however, did not appear to have any intention of leaving off,
for he continued, like a man in a trance, to repeat what he had said
before, seeming to be under the impression that he had to make a
separate explanation to each individual member of the audience.At
last the crowd could stand it no longer, and began to shout 'Hear,
hear' and to bang bits of wood and hammers on the floor and the
benches; and then, after a final repetition of the statement, that the
object of the meeting was to consider the advisability of holding an
outing, or beanfeast, the chairman collapsed on to a carpenter's stool
and wiped the sweat from his forehead.Crass then reminded the meeting that the last year's Beano had been an
unqualified success, and for his part he would be very sorry if they
did not have one this year.Last year they had four brakes, and they
went to Tubberton Village.It was true that there was nothing much to see at Tubberton, but there
was one thing they could rely on getting there that they could not be
sure of getting for the same money anywhere else, and that was--a good
feed.Just for the sake of getting on with the business,
he would propose that they decide to go to Tubberton, and that a
committee be appointed to make arrangements--about the dinner--with the
landlord of the Queen Elizabeth's Head at that place.Philpot seconded the motion, and Payne was about to call for a show of
hands when Harlow rose to a point of order.It appeared to him that
they were getting on a bit too fast.The proper way to do this
business was first to take the feeling of the meeting as to whether
they wished to have a Beano at all, and then, if the meeting was in
favour of it, they could decide where they were to go, and whether they
would have a whole day or only half a day.The Semi-drunk said that he didn't care a dreadful expression where
they went: he was willing to abide by the decision of the majority.It was a matter of indifference to him whether they had a
day, or half a day, or two days; he was agreeable to anything.Easton suggested that a special saloon carriage might be engaged, and
they could go and visit Madame Tussaud's Waxworks.He had never been
to that place and had often wished to see it.But Philpot objected
that if they went there, Madame Tussaud's might be unwilling to let
them out again.Bundy endorsed the remarks that had fallen from Crass with reference to
Tubberton.He did not care where they went, they would never get such
a good spread for the money as they did last year at the Queen
Elizabeth.The chairman said that he remembered the last Beano very well.They
had half a day--left off work on Saturday at twelve instead of one--so
there was only one hour's wages lost--they went home, had a wash and
changed their clothes, and got up to the Cricketers, where the brakes
was waiting, at one.Then they had the two hours' drive to Tubberton,
stopping on the way for drinks at the Blue Lion, the Warrior's Head,
the Bird in Hand, the Dewdrop Inn and the World Turned Upside Down.They arrived at the Queen Elizabeth at three-thirty, and
the dinner was ready; and it was one of the finest blow-outs he had
ever had.There was soup, vegetables, roast beef, roast
mutton, lamb and mint sauce, plum duff, Yorkshire, and a lot more.The
landlord of the Elizabeth kept as good a drop of beer as anyone could
wish to drink, and as for the teetotallers, they could have tea, coffee
or ginger beer.Having thus made another start, Payne found it very difficult to leave
off, and was proceeding to relate further details of the last Beano
when Harlow again rose up from his heap of shavings and said he wished
to call the chairman to order.What the hell was the
use of all this discussion before they had even decided to have a Beano
at all!Was the meeting in favour of a Beano or not?Everyone was very
uncomfortable, looking stolidly on the ground or staring straight in
front of them.At last Easton broke the silence by suggesting that it would not be a
bad plan if someone was to make a motion that a Beano be held.This
was greeted with a general murmur of 'Hear, hear,' followed by another
awkward pause, and then the chairman asked Easton if he would move a
resolution to that effect.After some hesitation, Easton agreed, and
formally moved: 'That this meeting is in favour of a Beano.'The Semi-drunk said that, in order to get on with the business, he
would second the resolution.But meantime, several arguments had
broken out between the advocates of different places, and several men
began to relate anecdotes of previous Beanos.Nearly everyone was
speaking at once and it was some time before the chairman was able to
put the resolution.Finding it impossible to make his voice heard
above the uproar, he began to hammer on the bench with a wooden mallet,
and to shout requests for order, but this only served to increase the
din.Some of them looked at him curiously and wondered what was the
matter with him, but the majority were so interested in their own
arguments that they did not notice him at all.Whilst the chairman was trying to get the attention of the meeting in
order to put the question, Bundy had become involved in an argument
with several of the new hands who claimed to know of an even better
place than the Queen Elizabeth, a pub called 'The New Found Out', at
Mirkfield, a few miles further on than Tubberton, and another
individual joined in the dispute, alleging that a house called 'The
Three Loggerheads' at Slushton-cum-Dryditch was the finest place for a
Beano within a hundred miles of Mugsborough.He went there last year
with Pushem and Driver's crowd, and they had roast beef, goose, jam
tarts, mince pies, sardines, blancmange, calves' feet jelly and one
pint for each man was included in the cost of the dinner.In the
middle of the discussion, they noticed that most of the others were
holding up their hands, so to show there was no ill feeling they held
up theirs also and then the chairman declared it was carried
unanimously.Bundy said he would like to ask the chairman to read out the resolution
which had just been passed, as he had not caught the words.The chairman replied that there was no written resolution.The motion
was just to express the feeling of this meeting as to whether there was
to be an outing or not.Bundy said he was only asking a civil question, a point of information:
all he wanted to know was, what was the terms of the resolution?Was
they in favour of the Beano or not?The chairman responded that the meeting was unanimously in favour.Harlow said that the next thing to be done was to decide upon the date.That would give them
plenty of time to pay in.Sawkins asked whether it was proposed to have a day or only half a day.He himself was in favour of the whole day.It would only mean losing a
morning's work.It was hardly worth going at all if they only had half
the day.The Semi-drunk remarked that he had just thought of a very good place
to go if they decided to have a change.Three years ago he was working
for Dauber and Botchit and they went to 'The First In and the Last Out'
at Bashford.It was a very small place, but there was a field where
you could have a game of cricket or football, and the dinner was A1 at
Lloyds.There was also a skittle alley attached to the pub and no
charge was made for the use of it.There was a bit of a river there,
and one of the chaps got so drunk that he went orf his onion and jumped
into the water, and when they got him out the village policeman locked
him up, and the next day he was took before the beak and fined two
pounds or a month's hard labour for trying to commit suicide.Easton pointed out that there was another way to look at it: supposing
they decided to have the Beano, he supposed it would come to about six
shillings a head.If they had it at the end of August and started
paying in now, say a tanner a week, they would have plenty of time to
make up the amount, but supposing the work fell off and some of them
got the push?Crass said that in that case a man could either have his money back or
he could leave it, and continue his payments even if he were working
for some other firm; the fact that he was off from Rushton's would not
prevent him from going to the Beano.Harlow proposed that they decide to go to the Queen Elizabeth the same
as last year, and that they have half a day.Philpot said that, in order to get on with the business, he would
second the resolution.Bundy suggested--as an amendment--that it should be a whole day,
starting from the Cricketers at nine in the morning, and Sawkins said
that, in order to get on with the business, he would second the
amendment.One of the new hands said he wished to move another amendment.He
proposed to strike out the Queen Elizabeth and substitute the Three
Loggerheads.The Chairman--after a pause--inquired if there were any seconder to
this, and the Semi-drunk said that, although he did not care much where
they went, still, to get on with the business, he would second the
amendment, although for his own part he would prefer to go to the
'First In and Last Out' at Bashford.The new hand offered to withdraw his suggestion re the Three
Loggerheads in favour of the Semi-drunks proposition, but the latter
said it didn't matter; it could go as it was.As it was getting rather late, several men went home, and cries of 'Put
the question' began to be heard on all sides; the chairman accordingly
was proceeding to put Harlow's proposition when the new hand
interrupted him by pointing out that it was his duty as chairman to put
the amendments first.This produced another long discussion, in the
course of which a very tall, thin man who had a harsh, metallic voice
gave a long rambling lecture about the rules of order and the conduct
of public meetings.He spoke very slowly and deliberately, using very
long words and dealing with the subject in an exhaustive manner.A
resolution was a resolution, and an amendment was an amendment; then
there was what was called an amendment to an amendment; the procedure
of the House of Commons differed very materially from that of the House
of Lords--and so on.This man kept on talking for about ten minutes, and might have
continued for ten hours if he had not been rudely interrupted by
Harlow, who said that it seemed to him that they were likely to stay
there all night if they went on like they were going.He wanted his
tea, and he would also like to get a few hours' sleep before having to
resume work in the morning.He was getting about sick of all this
talk.In order to get on with the business, he would
withdraw his resolution if the others would withdraw their amendments.If they would agree to do this, he would then propose another
resolution which--if carried--would meet all the requirements of the
case.The man with the metallic voice observed that it was not necessary to
ask the consent of those who had moved amendments: if the original
proposition was withdrawed, all the amendments fell to the ground.'Last year,' observed Crass, 'when we was goin' out of the room after
we'd finished our dinner at the Queen Elizabeth, the landlord pointed
to the table and said, "There's enough left over for you all to 'ave
another lot."'Harlow said that he would move that it be held on the last Saturday in
August; that it be for half a day, starting at one o'clock so that they
could work up till twelve, which would mean that they would only have
to lose one hour's pay: that they go to the same place as last
year--the Queen Elizabeth.That the same committee that
acted last year--Crass and Bundy--be appointed to make all the
arrangements and collect the subscriptions.The tall man observed that this was what was called a compound
resolution, and was proceeding to explain further when the chairman
exclaimed that it did not matter a dam' what it was called--would
anyone second it?The Semi-drunk said that he would--in order to get
on with the business.Bundy moved, and Sawkins seconded, as an amendment, that it should be a
whole day.The new hand moved to substitute the Loggerheads for the Queen
Elizabeth.Easton proposed to substitute Madame Tussaud's Waxworks for the Queen
Elizabeth.He said he moved this just to test the feeling of the
meeting.Harlow pointed out that it would cost at least a pound a head to defray
the expenses of such a trip.The railway fares, tram fares in London,
meals--for it would be necessary to have a whole day--and other
incidental expenses; to say nothing of the loss of wages.It would not
be possible for any of them to save the necessary amount during the
next four months.Philpot repeated his warning as to the danger of visiting Madame
Tussaud's.He was certain that if she once got them in there she would
never let them out again.He had no desire to pass the rest of his
life as an image in a museum.One of the new hands--a man with a red tie--said that they would look
well, after having been soaked for a month or two in petrifying liquid,
chained up in the Chamber of Horrors with labels round their
necks--'Specimens of Liberal and Conservative upholders of the
Capitalist System, 20 century'.Crass protested against the introduction of politics into that meeting.The remarks of the last speakers were most uncalled-for.Easton said that he would withdraw his amendment.Acting under the directions of the man with the metallic voice, the
chairman now proceeded to put the amendment to the vote.Bundy's
proposal that it should be a whole day was defeated, only himself,
Sawkins and the Semi-drunk being in favour.The motion to substitute
the Loggerheads for the Queen Elizabeth was also defeated, and the
compound resolution proposed by Harlow was then carried nem.Philpot now proposed a hearty vote of thanks to the chairman for the
very able manner in which he had conducted the meeting.When this had
been unanimously agreed to, the Semi-drunk moved a similar tribute of
gratitude to Crass for his services to the cause and the meeting
dispersed.Chapter 42

June


During the early part of May the weather was exceptionally bad, with
bitterly cold winds.Rain fell nearly every day, covering the roads
with a slush that penetrated the rotten leather of the cheap or
second-hand boots worn by the workmen.This weather had the effect of
stopping nearly all outside work, and also caused a lot of illness, for
those who were so fortunate as to have inside jobs frequently got wet
through on their way to work in the morning and had to work all day in
damp clothing, and with their boots saturated with water.It was also
a source of trouble to those of the men who had allotments, because if
it had been fine they would have been able to do something to their
gardens while they were out of work.Newman had not succeeded in getting a job at the trade since he came
out of prison, but he tried to make a little money by hawking bananas.Philpot--when he was at work--used often to buy a tanner's or a bob's
worth from him and give them to Mrs Linden's children.On Saturdays
Old Joe used to waylay these children and buy them bags of cakes at the
bakers.One week when he knew that Mrs Linden had not had much work to
do, he devised a very cunning scheme to help her.He had been working
with Slyme, who was papering a large boarded ceiling in a shop.It had
to be covered with unbleached calico before it could be papered and
when the work was done there were a number of narrow pieces of calico
left over.These he collected and tore into strips about six inches
wide which he took round to Mrs Linden, and asked her to sew them
together, end to end, so as to make one long strip: then this long
strip had to be cut into four pieces of equal length and the edges sewn
together in such a manner that it would form a long tube.Philpot told
her that it was required for some work that Rushton's were doing, and
said he had undertaken to get the sewing done.The firm would have to
pay for it, so she could charge a good price.'You see,' he said with a wink, 'this is one of those jobs where we
gets a chance to get some of our own back.'Mary thought it was rather a strange sort of job, but she did as
Philpot directed and when he came for the stuff and asked how much it
was she said threepence: it had only taken about half an hour.Philpot
ridiculed this: it was not nearly enough.THEY were not supposed to
know how long it took: it ought to be a bob at the very least.So,
after some hesitation she made out a bill for that amount on a
half-sheet of note-paper.He brought her the money the next Saturday
afternoon and went off chuckling to himself over the success of the
scheme.It did not occur to him until the next day that he might just
as well have got her to make him an apron or two: and when he did think
of this he said that after all it didn't matter, because if he had done
that it would have been necessary to buy new calico, and anyhow, it
could be done some other time.Newman did not make his fortune out of the bananas--seldom more than
two shillings a day--and consequently he was very glad when Philpot
called at his house one evening and told him there was a chance of a
job at Rushton's.Newman accordingly went to the yard the next
morning, taking his apron and blouse and his bag of tools with him,
ready to start work.He got there at about quarter to six and was
waiting outside when Hunter arrived.The latter was secretly very glad
to see him, for there was a rush of work in and they were short of men.He did not let this appear, of course, but hesitated for a few minutes
when Newman repeated the usual formula: 'Any chance of a job, sir?''We wasn't at all satisfied with you last time you was on, you know,'
said Misery.'Still, I don't mind giving you another chance.But if
you want to hold your job you'll have to move yourself a bit quicker
than you did before.'Towards the end of the month things began to improve all round.As time went on the improvement
was maintained and nearly everyone was employed.Rushton's were so busy
that they took on several other old hands who had been sacked the
previous year for being too slow.Thanks to the influence of Crass, Easton was now regarded as one of the
regular hands.He had recently resumed the practice of spending some
of his evenings at the Cricketers.It is probable that even if it had
not been for his friendship with Crass, he would still have continued
to frequent the public house, for things were not very comfortable at
home.Somehow or other, Ruth and he seemed to be always quarrelling,
and he was satisfied that it was not always his fault.Sometimes,
after the day's work was over he would go home resolved to be good
friends with her: he would plan on his way homewards to suggest to her
that they should have their tea and then go out for a walk with the
child.Once or twice she agreed, but on each occasion, they quarrelled
before they got home again.So after a time he gave up trying to be
friends with her and went out by himself every evening as soon as he
had had his tea.Mary Linden, who was still lodging with them, could not help perceiving
their unhappiness: she frequently noticed that Ruth's eyes were red and
swollen as if with crying, and she gently sought to gain her
confidence, but without success.On one occasion when Mary was trying
to advise her, Ruth burst out into a terrible fit of weeping, but she
would not say what was the cause--except that her head was aching--she
was not well, that was all.Sometimes Easton passed the evening at the Cricketers but frequently he
went over to the allotments, where Harlow had a plot of ground.Harlow
used to get up about four o'clock in the morning and put in an hour or
so at his garden before going to work; and every evening as soon as he
had finished tea he used to go there again and work till it was dark.Sometimes he did not go home to tea at all, but went straight from work
to the garden, and his children used to bring his tea to him there in a
glass bottle, with something to eat in a little basket.He had four
children, none of whom were yet old enough to go to work, and as may be
imagined, he found it a pretty hard struggle to live.He was not a
teetotaller, but as he often remarked, 'what the publicans got from him
wouldn't make them very fat', for he often went for weeks together
without tasting the stuff, except a glass or two with the Sunday
dinner, which he did not regard as an unnecessary expense, because it
was almost as cheap as tea or coffee.Fortunately his wife was a good needlewoman, and as sober and
industrious as himself; by dint of slaving incessantly from morning
till night she managed to keep her home fairly comfortable and the
children clean and decently dressed; they always looked respectable,
although they did not always have enough proper food to eat.They
looked so respectable that none of the 'visiting ladies' ever regarded
them as deserving cases.Harlow paid fifteen shillings a year for his plot of ground, and
although it meant a lot of hard work it was also a source of pleasure
and some profit.He generally made a few shillings out of the flowers,
besides having enough potatoes and other vegetables to last them nearly
all the year.Sometimes Easton went over to the allotments and lent Harlow a hand
with this gardening work, but whether he went there or to the
Cricketers, he usually returned home about half past nine, and then
went straight to bed, often without speaking a single word to Ruth, who
for her part seldom spoke to him except to answer something he said, or
to ask some necessary question.At first, Easton used to think that it
was all because of the way he had behaved to her in the public house,
but when he apologized--as he did several times--and begged her to
forgive him and forget about it, she always said it was all right;
there was nothing to forgive.Then, after a time, he began to think it
was on account of their poverty and the loss of their home, for nearly
all their furniture had been sold during the last winter.But whenever
he talked of trying to buy some more things to make the place
comfortable again, she did not appear to take any interest: the house
was neat enough as it was: they could manage very well, she said,
indifferently.One evening, about the middle of June, when he had been over to the
allotments, Easton brought her home a bunch of flowers that Harlow had
given him--some red and white roses and some <DW29>s.When he came in,
Ruth was packing his food basket for the next day.The baby was asleep
in its cot on the floor near the window.Although it was nearly nine
o'clock the lamp had not yet been lighted and the mournful twilight
that entered the room through the open window increased the desolation
of its appearance.The fire had burnt itself out and the grate was
filled with ashes.On the hearth was an old rug made of jute that had
once been printed in bright colours which had faded away till the whole
surface had become almost uniformly drab, showing scarcely any trace of
the original pattern.The rest of the floor was bare except for two or
three small pieces of old carpet that Ruth had bought for a few pence
at different times at some inferior second-hand shop.The chairs and
the table were almost the only things that were left of the original
furniture of the room, and except for three or four plates of different
patterns and sizes and a few cups and saucers, the shelves of the
dresser were bare.The stillness of the atmosphere was disturbed only by the occasional
sound of the wheels of a passing vehicle and the strangely distinct
voices of some children who were playing in the street.'I've brought you these,' said Easton, offering her the flowers.You know I've been
helping him a little with his garden.'At first he thought she did not want to take them.She was standing at
the table with her back to the window, so that he was unable to see the
expression of her face, and she hesitated for a moment before she
faltered out some words of thanks and took the flowers, which she put
down on the table almost as soon as she touched them.Offended at what he considered her contemptuous indifference, Easton
made no further attempt at conversation but went into the scullery to
wash his hands, and then went up to bed.Downstairs, for a long time after he was gone, Ruth sat alone by the
fireless grate, in the silence and the gathering shadows, holding the
bunch of flowers in her hand, living over again the events of the last
year, and consumed with an agony of remorse.The presence of Mary Linden and the two children in the house probably
saved Ruth from being more unhappy than she was.Little Elsie had made
an arrangement with her to be allowed to take the baby out for walks,
and in return Ruth did Elsie's housework.As for Mary, she had not
much time to do anything but sew, almost the only relaxation she knew
being when she took the work home, and on Sunday, which she usually
devoted to a general clean-up of the room, and to mending the
children's clothes.Sometimes on Sunday evening she used to go with
Ruth and the children to see Mrs Owen, who, although she was not ill
enough to stay in bed, seldom went out of the house.She had never
really recovered from the attack of illness which was brought on by her
work at the boarding house.The doctor had been to see her once or
twice and had prescribed--rest.She was to lie down as much as
possible, not to do any heavy work--not to carry or lift any heavy
articles, scrub floors, make beds, or anything of that sort: and she
was to take plenty of nourishing food, beef tea, chicken, a little wine
and so on.He did not suggest a trip round the world in a steam yacht
or a visit to Switzerland--perhaps he thought they might not be able to
afford it.Sometimes she was so ill that she had to observe one at
least of the doctor's instructions--to lie down: and then she would
worry and fret because she was not able to do the housework and because
Owen had to prepare his own tea when he came home at night.On one of
these occasions it would have been necessary for Owen to stay at home
from work if it had not been for Mrs Easton, who came for several days
in succession to look after her and attend to the house.Fortunately, Owen's health was better since the weather had become
warmer.For a long time after the attack of haemorrhage he had while
writing the show-card he used to dread going to sleep at night for fear
it should recur.He had heard of people dying in their sleep from that
cause.Nora knew nothing of what
occurred that night: to have told her would have done no good, but on
the contrary would have caused her a lot of useless anxiety.Sometimes
he doubted whether it was right not to tell her, but as time went by
and his health continued to improve he was glad he had said nothing
about it.Frankie had lately resumed his athletic exercises with the flat iron:
his strength was returning since Owen had been working regularly,
because he had been having his porridge and milk again and also some
Parrish's Food which a chemist at Windley was selling large bottles of
for a shilling.He used to have what he called a 'party' two or three
times a week with Elsie, Charley and Easton's baby as the guests.Sometimes, if Mrs Owen were not well, Elsie used to stay in with her
after tea and do some housework while the boys went out to play, but
more frequently the four children used to go together to the park to
play or sail boats on the lake.Once one of the boats was becalmed
about a couple of yards from shore and while trying to reach it with a
stick Frankie fell into the water, and when Charley tried to drag him
out he fell in also.Elsie put the baby down on the bank and seized
hold of Charley and while she was trying to get him out, the baby began
rolling down, and would probably have tumbled in as well if a man who
happened to be passing by had not rushed up in time to prevent it.Fortunately the water at that place was only about two feet deep, so
the boys were not much the worse for their ducking.They returned home
wet through, smothered with mud, and feeling very important, like boys
who had distinguished themselves.After this, whenever she could manage to spare the time, Ruth Easton
used to go with the children to the park.There was a kind of
summer-house near the shore of the lake, only a few feet away from the
water's edge, surrounded and shaded by trees, whose branches arched
over the path and drooped down to the surface of the water.While the
children played Ruth used to sit in this arbour and sew, but often her
work was neglected and forgotten as she gazed pensively at the water,
which just there looked very still, and dark, and deep, for it was
sheltered from the wind and over-shadowed by the trees that lined the
banks at the end of the lake.Sometimes, if it happened to be raining, instead of going out the
children used to have some games in the house.On one such occasion
Frankie produced the flat iron and went through the exercise, and
Charley had a go as well.But although he was slightly older and
taller than Frankie he could not lift the iron so often or hold it out
so long as the other, a failure that Frankie attributed to the fact
that Charley had too much tea and bread and butter instead of porridge
and milk and Parrish's Food.Charley was so upset about his lack of
strength that he arranged with Frankie to come home with him the next
day after school to see his mother about it.Mrs Linden had a flat
iron, so they gave a demonstration of their respective powers before
her.Mrs Easton being also present, by request, because Frankie said
that the diet in question was suitable for babies as well as big
children.He had been brought up on it ever since he could remember,
and it was almost as cheap as bread and butter and tea.The result of the exhibition was that Mrs Linden promised to make
porridge for Charley and Elsie whenever she could spare the time, and
Mrs Easton said she would try it for the baby also.Chapter 43

The Good Old Summer-time


All through the summer the crowd of ragged-trousered philanthropists
continued to toil and sweat at their noble and unselfish task of making
money for Mr Rushton.Painting the outsides of houses and shops, washing off and distempering
ceilings, stripping old paper off walls, painting and papering rooms
and staircases, building new rooms or other additions to old houses or
business premises, digging up old drains, repairing leaky roofs and
broken windows.Their zeal and enthusiasm in the good cause was unbounded.They were
supposed to start work at six o'clock, but most of them were usually to
be found waiting outside the job at about a quarter to that hour,
sitting on the kerbstones or the doorstep.Their operations extended all over the town: at all hours of the day
they were to be seen either going or returning from 'jobs', carrying
ladders, planks, pots of paint, pails of whitewash, earthenware,
chimney pots, drainpipes, lengths of guttering, closet pans, grates,
bundles of wallpaper, buckets of paste, sacks of cement, and loads of
bricks and mortar.Quite a common spectacle--for gods and men--was a
procession consisting of a handcart loaded up with such materials being
pushed or dragged through the public streets by about half a dozen of
these Imperialists in broken boots and with battered, stained,
discoloured bowler hats, or caps splashed with paint and whitewash;
their stand-up collars dirty, limp and crumpled, and their rotten
second-hand misfit clothing saturated with sweat and plastered with
mortar.Even the assistants in the grocers' and drapers' shops laughed and
ridiculed and pointed the finger of scorn at them as they passed.The superior classes--those who do nothing--regarded them as a sort of
lower animals.A letter appeared in the Obscurer one week from one of
these well-dressed loafers, complaining of the annoyance caused to the
better-class visitors by workmen walking on the pavement as they passed
along the Grand Parade in the evening on their way home from work, and
suggesting that they should walk in the roadway.When they heard of
the letter a lot of the workmen adopted the suggestion and walked in
the road so as to avoid contaminating the idlers.This letter was followed by others of a somewhat similar kind, and one
or two written in a patronizing strain in defence of the working
classes by persons who evidently knew nothing about them.There was
also a letter from an individual who signed himself 'Morpheus'
complaining that he was often awakened out of his beauty sleep in the
middle of the night by the clattering noise of the workmen's boots as
they passed his house on their way to work in the morning.'Morpheus'
wrote that not only did they make a dreadful noise with their horrible
iron-clad boots, but they were in the habit of coughing and spitting a
great deal, which was very unpleasant to hear, and they conversed in
loud tones.Sometimes their conversation was not at all edifying, for
it consisted largely of bad language, which 'Morpheus' assumed to be
attributable to the fact that they were out of temper because they had
to rise so early.As a rule they worked till half-past five in the evening, and by the
time they reached home it was six o'clock.When they had taken their
evening meal and had a wash it was nearly eight: about nine most of
them went to bed so as to be able to get up about half past four the
next morning to make a cup of tea before leaving home at half past five
to go to work again.Frequently it happened that they had to leave
home earlier than this, because their 'job' was more than half an
hour's walk away.It did not matter how far away the 'job' was from
the shop, the men had to walk to and fro in their own time, for Trades
Union rules were a dead letter in Mugsborough.There were no tram
fares or train fares or walking time allowed for the likes of them.Ninety-nine out of every hundred of them did not believe in such things
as those: they had much more sense than to join Trades Unions: on the
contrary, they believed in placing themselves entirely at the mercy of
their good, kind Liberal and Tory masters.Very frequently it happened, when only a few men were working together,
that it was not convenient to make tea for breakfast or dinner, and
then some of them brought tea with them ready made in bottles and drank
it cold; but most of them went to the nearest pub and ate their food
there with a glass of beer.Even those who would rather have had tea
or coffee had beer, because if they went to a temperance restaurant or
coffee tavern it generally happened that they were not treated very
civilly unless they bought something to eat as well as to drink, and
the tea at such places was really dearer than beer, and the latter was
certainly quite as good to drink as the stewed tea or the liquid mud
that was sold as coffee at cheap 'Workmen's' Eating Houses.There were some who were--as they thought--exceptionally lucky: the
firms they worked for were busy enough to let them work two hours'
overtime every night--till half past seven--without stopping for tea.Most of these arrived home about eight, completely flattened out.Then
they had some tea and a wash and before they knew where they were it
was about half past nine.Then they went to sleep again till half past
four or five the next morning.They were usually so tired when they got home at night that they never
had any inclination for study or any kind of self-improvement, even if
they had had the time.They had plenty of time to study during the
winter: and their favourite subject then was, how to preserve
themselves from starving to death.This overtime, however, was the exception, for although in former years
it had been the almost invariable rule to work till half past seven in
summer, most of the firms now made a practice of ceasing work at
five-thirty.The revolution which had taken place in this matter was a
favourite topic of conversation amongst the men, who spoke regretfully
of the glorious past, when things were busy, and they used to work
fifteen, sixteen and even eighteen hours a day.But nowadays there
were nearly as many chaps out of work in the summer as in the winter.They used to discuss the causes of the change.One was, of course, the
fact that there was not so much building going on as formerly, and
another was the speeding up and slave-driving, and the manner in which
the work was now done, or rather scamped.As old Philpot said, he
could remember the time, when he was a nipper, when such a 'job' as
that at 'The Cave' would have lasted at least six months, and they
would have had more hands on it too!But it would have been done
properly, not messed up like that was: all the woodwork would have been
rubbed down with pumice stone and water: all the knots cut out and the
holes properly filled up, and the work properly rubbed down with
glass-paper between every coat.But nowadays the only place you'd see
a bit of pumice stone was in a glass case in a museum, with a label on
it.'Pumice Stone: formerly used by house-painters.'Most of them spoke of those bygone times with poignant regret, but
there were a few--generally fellows who had been contaminated by
contact with Socialists or whose characters had been warped and
degraded by the perusal of Socialist literature--who said that they did
not desire to work overtime at all--ten hours a day were quite enough
for them--in fact they would rather do only eight.What they wanted,
they said, was not more work, but more grub, more clothes, more
leisure, more pleasure and better homes.They wanted to be able to go
for country walks or bicycle rides, to go out fishing or to go to the
seaside and bathe and lie on the beach and so forth.But these were
only a very few; there were not many so selfish as this.The majority
desired nothing but to be allowed to work, and as for their children,
why, 'what was good enough for themselves oughter be good enough for
the kids'.They often said that such things as leisure, culture, pleasure and the
benefits of civilization were never intended for 'the likes of us'.They did not--all--actually say this, but that was what their conduct
amounted to; for they not only refused to help to bring about a better
state of things for their children, but they ridiculed and opposed and
cursed and abused those who were trying to do it for them.The foulest
words that came out of their mouths were directed against the men of
their own class in the House of Commons--the Labour Members--and
especially the Socialists, whom they spoke of as fellows who were too
bloody lazy to work for a living, and who wanted the working classes to
keep them.Some of them said that they did not believe in helping their children
to become anything better than their parents had been because in such
cases the children, when they grew up, 'looked down' upon and were
ashamed of their fathers and mothers!They seemed to think that if
they loved and did their duty to their children, the probability was
that the children would prove ungrateful: as if even if that were true,
it would be any excuse for their indifference.Another cause of the shortage of work was the intrusion into the trade
of so many outsiders: fellows like Sawkins and the other lightweights.Whatever other causes there were, there could be no doubt that the
hurrying and scamping was a very real one.Every 'job' had to be done
at once!as if it were a matter of life or death!It must be finished
by a certain time.If the 'job' was at an empty house, Misery's yarn
was that it was let!the people were coming in at the end of the week!therefore everything must be finished by Wednesday night.All the
ceilings had to be washed off, the walls stripped and repapered, and
two coats of paint inside and outside the house.New drains were to be
put in, and all broken windows and locks and broken plaster repaired.A number of men--usually about half as many as there should have
been--would be sent to do the work, and one man was put in charge of
the 'job'.These sub-foremen or 'coddies' knew that if they'made
their jobs pay' they would be put in charge of others and be kept on in
preference to other men as long as the firm had any work; so they
helped Misery to scheme and scamp the work and watched and drove the
men under their charge; and these latter poor wretches, knowing that
their only chance of retaining their employment was to 'tear into it',
tore into it like so many maniacs.Instead of cleaning any parts of
the woodwork that were greasy or very dirty, they brushed them over
with a coat of spirit varnish before painting to make sure that the
paint would dry: places where the plaster of the walls was damaged were
repaired with what was humorously called 'garden cement'--which was the
technical term for dirt out of the garden--and the surface was skimmed
over with proper material.Ceilings that were not very dirty were not
washed off, but dusted, and lightly gone over with a thin coat of
whitewash.The old paper was often left upon the walls of rooms that
were supposed to be stripped before being repapered, and to conceal
this the joints of the old paper were rubbed down so that they should
not be perceptible through the new paper.As far as possible, Misery
and the sub-foreman avoided doing the work the customers paid for, and
even what little they did was hurried over anyhow.A reign of terror--the terror of the sack--prevailed on all the 'jobs',
which were carried on to the accompaniment of a series of alarums and
excursions: no man felt safe for a moment: at the most unexpected times
Misery would arrive and rush like a whirlwind all over the 'job'.If
he happened to find a man having a spell the culprit was immediately
discharged, but he did not get the opportunity of doing this very often
for everybody was too terrified to leave off working even for a few
minutes' rest.From the moment of Hunter's arrival until his departure, a state of
panic, hurry, scurry and turmoil reigned.His strident voice rang
through the house as he bellowed out to them to 'Rouse themselves!We've got another job to
start when you've done this!'Occasionally, just to keep the others up to concert pitch, he used to
sack one of the men for being too slow.They all trembled before him
and ran about whenever he spoke to or called them, because they knew
that there were always a lot of other men out of work who would be
willing and eager to fill their places if they got the sack.Although it was now summer, and the Distress Committee and all the
other committees had suspended operations, there was still always a
large number of men hanging about the vicinity of the Fountain on the
Parade--The Wage Slave Market.When men finished up for the firm they
were working for they usually made for that place.Any master in want
of a wage slave for a few hours, days or weeks could always buy one
there.The men knew this and they also knew that if they got the sack
from one firm it was no easy matter to get another job, and that was
why they were terrified.When Misery was gone--to repeat the same performance at some other
job--the sub-foreman would have a crawl round to see how the chaps were
getting on: to find out if they had used up all their paint yet, or to
bring them some putty so that they should not have to leave their work
to go to get anything themselves: and then very often Rushton himself
would come and stalk quietly about the house or stand silently behind
the men, watching them as they worked.He seldom spoke to anyone, but
just stood there like a graven image, or walked about like a dumb
animal--a pig, as the men used to say.This individual had a very
exalted idea of his own importance and dignity.One man got the sack
for presuming to stop him in the street to ask some questions about
some work that was being done.Misery went round to all the jobs the next day and told all the
'coddies' to tell all the hands that they were never to speak to Mr
Rushton if they met him in the street, and the following Saturday the
man who had so offended was given his back day, ostensibly because
there was nothing for him to do, but really for the reason stated above.There was one job, the outside of a large house that stood on elevated
ground overlooking the town.The men who were working there were even
more than usually uncomfortable, for it was said that Rushton used to
sit in his office and watch them through a telescope.Sometimes, when it was really necessary to get a job done by a certain
time, they had to work late, perhaps till eight or nine o'clock.No
time was allowed for tea, but some of them brought sufficient food with
them in the morning to enable them to have a little about six o'clock
in the evening.Others arranged for their children to bring them some
tea from home.As a rule, they partook of this without stopping work:
they had it on the floor beside them and ate and drank and worked at
the same time--a paint-brushful of white lead in one hand, and a piece
of bread and margarine in the other.On some jobs, if the 'coddy'
happened to be a decent sort, they posted a sentry to look out for
Hunter or Rushton while the others knocked off for a few minutes to
snatch a mouthful of grub; but it was not safe always to do this, for
there was often some crawling sneak with an ambition to become a
'coddy' who would not scruple to curry favour with Misery by reporting
the crime.As an additional precaution against the possibility of any of the men
idling or wasting their time, each one was given a time-sheet on which
he was required to account for every minute of the day.The form of
these sheets vary slightly with different firms: that of Rushton & Co.,
was as shown.TIME SHEET

One Monday morning Misery gave each of the sub-foremen an envelope
containing one of the firm's memorandum forms.Crass opened his and
found the following:

Crass

When you are on a job with men under you, check and initial their
time-sheets every night.If they are called away and sent to some other job, or stood off, check
and initial their time-sheets as they leave your job.Any man coming on your job during the day, you must take note of the
exact time of his arrival, and see that his sheet is charged right.Any man who is slow or lazy, or any man that you notice talking more
than is necessary during working hours, you must report him to Mr
Hunter.We expect you and the other foremen to help us to carry out
these rules, AND ANY INFORMATION GIVEN US ABOUT ANY MAN IS TREATED IN
CONFIDENCE.Note: This applies to all men of all trades who come on the jobs of
which you are the foreman.Every week the time-sheets were scrutinized, and every now and then a
man would be 'had up on the carpet' in the office before Rushton and
Misery, and interrogated as to why he had taken fifteen hours to do ten
hours work?In the event of the accused being unable to give a
satisfactory explanation of his conduct he was usually sacked on the
spot.Misery was frequently called 'up on the carpet' himself.If he made a mistake in figuring out a 'job', and gave in too high a
tender for it, so that the firm did not get the work, Rushton grumbled.If the price was so low that there was not enough profit, Rushton was
very unpleasant about it, and whenever it happened that there was not
only no profit but an actual loss, Rushton created such a terrible
disturbance that Misery was nearly frightened to death and used to get
on his bicycle and rush off to the nearest 'job' and howl and bellow at
the 'chaps' to get it done.All the time the capabilities of the men--especially with regard to
speed--were carefully watched and noted: and whenever there was a
slackness of work and it was necessary to discharge some hands those
that were slow or took too much pains were weeded out: this of course
was known to the men and it had the desired effect upon them.In justice to Rushton and Hunter, it must be remembered that there was
a certain amount of excuse for all this driving and cheating, because
they had to compete with all the other firms, who conducted their
business in precisely the same way.It was not their fault, but the
fault of the system.A dozen firms tendered for every 'job', and of course the lowest tender
usually obtained the work.Knowing this, they all cut the price down
to the lowest possible figure and the workmen had to suffer.The trouble was that there were too many'masters'.It would have been
far better for the workmen if nine out of every ten of the employers
had never started business.Then the others would have been able to
get a better price for their work, and the men might have had better
wages and conditions.The hands, however, made no such allowances or
excuses as these for Misery and Rushton.They never thought or spoke
of them except with hatred and curses.But whenever either of them
came to the 'job' the 'coddies' cringed and grovelled before them,
greeting them with disgustingly servile salutations, plentifully
interspersed with the word 'Sir', greetings which were frequently
either ignored altogether or answered with an inarticulate grunt.They
said 'Sir' at nearly every second word: it made one feel sick to hear
them because it was not courtesy: they were never courteous to each
other, it was simply abject servility and self-contempt.One of the results of all the frenzied hurrying was that every now and
then there was an accident: somebody got hurt: and it was strange that
accidents were not more frequent, considering the risks that were
taken.When they happened to be working on ladders in busy streets
they were not often allowed to have anyone to stand at the foot, and
the consequence was that all sorts and conditions of people came into
violent collision with the bottoms of the ladders.Small boys playing
in the reckless manner characteristic of their years rushed up against
them.Errand boys, absorbed in the perusal of penny instalments of the
adventures of Claude Duval, and carrying large baskets of
green-groceries, wandered into them.People with large feet became
entangled in them.Fat persons of both sexes who thought it unlucky to
walk underneath, tried to negotiate the narrow strip of pavement
between the foot of the ladder and the kerb, and in their passage
knocked up against the ladder and sometimes fell into the road.Nursemaids wheeling perambulators--lolling over the handle, which they
usually held with their left hands, the right holding a copy of Orange
Blossoms or some halfpenny paper, and so interested in the story of the
Marquis of Lymejuice--a young man of noble presence and fabulous
wealth, with a drooping golden moustache and very long legs, who,
notwithstanding the diabolical machinations of Lady Sibyl Malvoise, who
loves him as well as a woman with a name like that is capable of loving
anyone, is determined to wed none other than the scullery-maid at the
Village Inn--inevitably bashed the perambulators into the ladders.Even when the girls were not reading they nearly always ran into the
ladders, which seemed to possess a magnetic attraction for
perambulators and go-carts of all kinds, whether propelled by nurses or
mothers.Sometimes they would advance very cautiously towards the
ladder: then, when they got very near, hesitate a little whether to go
under or run the risk of falling into the street by essaying the narrow
passage: then they would get very close up to the foot of the ladder,
and dodge and dance about, and give the cart little pushes from side to
side, until at last the magnetic influence exerted itself and the
perambulator crashed into the ladder, perhaps at the very moment that
the man at the top was stretching out to do some part of the work
almost beyond his reach.Once Harlow had just started painting some rainpipes from the top of a
40-ft ladder when one of several small boys who were playing in the
street ran violently against the foot.Harlow was so startled that he
dropped his brushes and clutched wildly at the ladder, which turned
completely round and slid about six feet along the parapet into the
angle of the wall, with Harlow hanging beneath by his hands.The paint
pot was hanging by a hook from one of the rungs, and the jerk scattered
the brown paint it contained all over Harlow and all over the brickwork
of the front of the house.He managed to descend safely by clasping
his legs round the sides of the ladder and sliding down.When Misery
came there was a row about what he called carelessness.And the next
day Harlow had to wear his Sunday trousers to work.On another occasion they were painting the outside of a house called
'Gothic Lodge'.At one corner it had a tower surmounted by a spire or
steeple, and this steeple terminated with an ornamental wrought-iron
pinnacle which had to be painted.The ladder they had was not quite
long enough, and besides that, as it had to stand in a sort of a
courtyard at the base of the tower, it was impossible to slant it
sufficiently: instead of lying along the roof of the steeple, it was
sticking up in the air.When Easton went up to paint the pinnacle he had to stand on almost the
very top rung of the ladder, to be exact, the third from the top, and
lean over to steady himself by holding on to the pinnacle with his left
hand while he used the brush with his right.As it was only about
twenty minutes' work there were two men to hold the foot of the ladder.It was cheaper to do it this way than to rig up a proper scaffold,
which would have entailed perhaps two hours' work for two or three men.Of course it was very dangerous, but that did not matter at all,
because even if the man fell it would make no difference to the
firm--all the men were insured and somehow or other, although they
frequently had narrow escapes, they did not often come to grief.On this occasion, just as Easton was finishing he felt the pinnacle
that he was holding on to give way, and he got such a fright that his
heart nearly stopped beating.He let go his hold and steadied himself
on the ladder as well as he was able, and when he had descended three
or four steps--into comparative safety--he remained clinging
convulsively to the ladder and feeling so limp that he was unable to go
down any further for several minutes.When he arrived at the bottom
and the others noticed how white and trembling he was, he told them
about the pinnacle being loose, and the 'coddy' coming along just then,
they told him about it, and suggested that it should be repaired, as
otherwise it might fall down and hurt someone: but the 'coddy' was
afraid that if they reported it they might be blamed for breaking it,
and the owner might expect the firm to put it right for nothing, so
they decided to say nothing about it.The pinnacle is still on the
apex of the steeple waiting for a sufficiently strong wind to blow it
down on somebody's head.When the other men heard of Easton's 'narrow shave', most of them said
that it would have served him bloody well right if he had fallen and
broken his neck: he should have refused to go up at all without a
proper scaffold.If Misery or the
coddy had ordered any of THEM to go up and paint the pinnacle off that
ladder, they would have chucked their tools down and demanded their
ha'pence!That was what they said, but somehow or other it never happened that
any of them ever 'chucked their tools down' at all, although such
dangerous jobs were of very frequent occurrence.The scamping business was not confined to houses or properties of an
inferior class: it was the general rule.Large good-class houses,
villas and mansions, the residences of wealthy people, were done in
exactly the same way.Generally in such places costly and beautiful
materials were spoilt in the using.There was a large mansion where the interior woodwork--the doors,
windows and staircase--had to be finished in white enamel.It was
rather an old house and the woodwork needed rubbing down and filling up
before being repainted, but of course there was not time for that, so
they painted it without properly preparing it and when it was enamelled
the rough, uneven surface of the wood looked horrible: but the owner
appeared quite satisfied because it was nice and shiny.The
dining-room of the same house was papered with a beautiful and
expensive plush paper.The ground of this wall-hanging was made to
imitate crimson watered silk, and it was covered with a raised pattern
in plush of the same colour.The price marked on the back of this
paper in the pattern book was eighteen shillings a roll.Slyme was
paid sixpence a roll for hanging it: the room took ten rolls, so it
cost nine pounds for the paper and five shillings to hang it!To fix
such a paper as this properly the walls should first be done with a
plain lining paper of the same colour as the ground of the wallpaper
itself, because unless the paperhanger 'lapps' the joints--which should
not be done--they are apt to open a little as the paper dries and to
show the white wall underneath--Slyme suggested this lining to Misery,
who would not entertain the idea for a moment--they had gone to quite
enough expense as it was, stripping the old paper off!So Slyme went ahead, and as he had to make his wages, he could not
spend a great deal of time over it.Some of the joints were 'lapped'
and some were butted, and two or three weeks after the owner of the
house moved in, as the paper became more dry, the joints began to open
and to show the white plaster of the wall, and then Owen had to go
there with a small pot of crimson paint and a little brush, and touch
out the white line.While he was doing this he noticed and touched up a number of other
faults; places where Slyme--in his haste to get the work done--had
slobbered and smeared the face of the paper with fingermarks and paste.The same ghastly mess was made of several other 'jobs' besides this
one, and presently they adopted the plan of painting strips of colour
on the wall in the places where the joints would come, so that if they
opened the white wall would not show: but it was found that the paste
on the back of the paper dragged the paint off the wall, and when the
joints opened the white streaks showed all the same, so Misery
abandoned all attempts to prevent joints showing, and if a customer
complained, he sent someone to 'touch it up': but the lining paper was
never used, unless the customer or the architect knew enough about the
work to insist upon it.In other parts of the same house the ceilings, the friezes, and the
dados, were covered with 'embossed' or'relief' papers.These hangings
require very careful handling, for the raised parts are easily damaged;
but the men who fixed them were not allowed to take the pains and time
necessary to make good work: consequently in many places--especially at
the joints--the pattern was flattened out and obliterated.The ceiling of the drawing-room was done with a very thick high-relief
paper that was made in sheets about two feet square.These squares
were not very true in shape: they had evidently warped in drying after
manufacture: to make them match anything like properly would need
considerable time and care.But the men were not allowed to take the
necessary time.The result was that when it was finished it presented
a sort of 'higgledy-piggledy' appearance.But it didn't matter:
nothing seemed to matter except to get it done.One would think from
the way the hands were driven and chivvied and hurried over the work
that they were being paid five or six shillings an hour instead of as
many pence.'For God's sake
get it done!We're losing money over this
"job"!If you chaps don't wake up and move a bit quicker, I shall see
if I can't get somebody else who will.'These costly embossed decorations were usually finished in white; but
instead of carefully coating them with specially prepared paint of
patent distemper, which would need two or three coats, they slobbered
one thick coat of common whitewash on to it with ordinary whitewash
brushes.This was a most economical way to get over it, because it made it
unnecessary to stop up the joints beforehand--the whitewash filled up
all the cracks: and it also filled up the hollow parts, the crevices
and interstices of the ornament, destroying the sharp outlines of the
beautiful designs and reducing the whole to a lumpy, formless mass.But
that did not matter either, so long as they got it done.The architect didn't notice it, because he knew that the more Rushton &
Co.made out of the 'job', the more he himself would make.The man who had to pay for the work didn't notice it; he had the
fullest confidence in the architect.At the risk of wearying the long-suffering reader, mention must be made
of an affair that happened at this particular 'job'.The windows were all fitted with venetian blinds.The gentleman for
whom all the work was being done had only just purchased the house, but
he preferred roller blinds: he had had roller blinds in his former
residence--which he had just sold--and as these roller blinds were
about the right size, he decided to have them fitted to the windows of
his new house: so he instructed Mr Rushton to have all the venetian
blinds taken down and stored away up in the loft under the roof.Mr
Rushton promised to have this done; but they were not ALL put away
under the roof: he had four of them taken to his own place and fitted
up in the conservatory.They were a little too large, so they had to
be narrowed before they were fixed.The sequel was rather interesting, for it happened that when the
gentleman attempted to take the roller blinds from his old house, the
person to whom he had sold it refused to allow them to be removed;
claiming that when he bought the house, he bought the blinds also.There was a little dispute, but eventually it was settled that way and
the gentleman decided that he would have the venetian blinds in his new
house after all, and instructed the people who moved his furniture to
take the venetians down again from under the roof, and refix them, and
then, of course, it was discovered that four of the blinds were
missing.Mr Rushton was sent for, and he said that he couldn't
understand it at all!The only possible explanation that he could
think of was that some of his workmen must have stolen them!He would
make inquiries, and endeavour to discover the culprits, but in any
case, as this had happened while things were in his charge, if he did
not succeed in recovering them, he would replace them.As the blinds had been narrowed to fit the conservatory he had to have
four new ones made.The customer was of course quite satisfied, although very sorry for Mr
Rushton.Rushton told the gentleman
that he would be astonished if he knew all the facts: the difficulties
one has to contend with in dealing with working men: one has to watch
them continually!directly one's back is turned they leave off working!They come late in the morning, and go home before the proper time at
night, and then unless one actually happens to catch them--they charge
the full number of hours on their time sheets!Every now and then
something would be missing, and of course Nobody knew anything about
it.Sometimes one would go unexpectedly to a 'job' and find a lot of
them drunk.Of course one tried to cope with these evils by means of
rules and restrictions and organization, but it was very difficult--one
could not be everywhere or have eyes at the back of one's head.The
gentleman said that he had some idea of what it was like: he had had
something to do with the lower orders himself at one time and another,
and he knew they needed a lot of watching.Rushton felt rather sick over this affair, but he consoled himself by
reflecting that he had got clear away with several valuable rose trees
and other plants which he had stolen out of the garden, and that a
ladder which had been discovered in the hayloft over the stable and
taken--by his instructions--to the 'yard' when the 'job' was finished
had not been missed.Another circumstance which helped to compensate for the blinds was that
the brass fittings throughout the house, finger-plates, sash-lifts and
locks, bolts and door handles, which were supposed to be all new and
which the customer had paid a good price for--were really all the old
ones which Misery had had re-lacquered and refixed.There was nothing unusual about this affair of the blinds, for Rushton
and Misery robbed everybody.They made a practice of annexing every
thing they could lay their hands upon, provided it could be done
without danger to themselves.They never did anything of a heroic or
dare-devil character: they had not the courage to break into banks or
jewellers' shops in the middle of the night, or to go out picking
pockets: all their robberies were of the sneak-thief order.At one house that they 'did up' Misery made a big haul.He had to get
up into the loft under the roof to see what was the matter with the
water tank.When he got up there he found a very fine hall gas lamp
made of wrought brass and copper with stained and painted glass sides.Although covered with dust, it was otherwise in perfect condition, so
Misery had it taken to his own house and cleaned up and fixed in the
hall.In the same loft there were a lot of old brass picture rods and other
fittings, and three very good planks, each about ten feet in length;
these latter had been placed across the rafters so that one could walk
easily and safely over to the tank.But Misery thought they would be
very useful to the firm for whitewashing ceilings and other work, so he
had them taken to the yard along with the old brass, which was worth
about fourpence a pound.There was another house that had to be painted inside: the people who
used to live there had only just left: they had moved to some other
town, and the house had been re-let before they vacated it.The new
tenant had agreed with the agent that the house was to be renovated
throughout before he took possession.The day after the old tenants moved away, the agent gave Rushton the
key so that he could go to see what was to be done and give an estimate
for the work.While Rushton and Misery were looking over the house they discovered a
large barometer hanging on the wall behind the front door: it had been
overlooked by those who removed the furniture.Before returning the
key to the agent, Rushton sent one of his men to the house for the
barometer, which he kept in his office for a few weeks to see if there
would be any inquiries about it.If there had been, it would have been
easy to say that he had brought it there for safety--to take care of
till he could find the owner.The people to whom it belonged thought
the thing had been lost or stolen in transit, and afterwards one of the
workmen who had assisted to pack and remove the furniture was dismissed
from his employment on suspicion of having had something to do with its
disappearance.No one ever thought of Rushton in connection with the
matter, so after about a month he had it taken to his own dwelling and
hung up in the hall near the carved oak marble-topped console table
that he had sneaked last summer from 596 Grand Parade.And there it hangs unto this day: and close behind it, supported by
cords of crimson silk, is a beautiful bevelled-edged card about a foot
square, and upon this card is written, in letters of gold: 'Christ is
the head of this house; the unseen Guest at every meal, the silent
Listener to every conversation.'And on the other side of the barometer is another card of the same kind
and size which says: 'As for me and my house we will serve the Lord.'From another place they stole two large brass chandeliers.This house
had been empty for a very long time, and its owner--who did not reside
in the town--wished to sell it.The agent, to improve the chances of a
sale, decided to have the house overhauled and redecorated.'s tender being the lowest, they got the work.The chandeliers in
the drawing-room and the dining-room were of massive brass, but they
were all blackened and tarnished.Misery suggested to the agent that
they could be cleaned and relacquered, which would make them equal to
new: in fact, they would be better than new ones, for such things as
these were not made now, and for once Misery was telling the truth.The agent agreed and the work was done: it was an extra, of course, and
as the firm got twice as much for the job as they paid for having it
done, they were almost satisfied.When this and all the other work was finished they sent in their
account and were paid.Some months afterwards the house was sold, and Nimrod interviewed the
new proprietor with the object of securing the order for any work that
he might want done.The papers on the walls of
several of the rooms were not to the new owner's taste, and, of course,
the woodwork would have to be re-painted to harmonize with the new
paper.There was a lot of other work besides this: a new conservatory
to build, a more modern bath and heating apparatus to be put in, and
the electric light to be installed, the new people having an objection
to the use of gas.The specifications were prepared by an architect, and Rushton secured
the work.When the chandeliers were taken down, the men, instructed by
Misery, put them on a handcart, and covered them over with sacks and
dust-sheets and took them to the front shop, where they were placed for
sale with the other stock.When all the work at the house was finished, it occurred to Rushton and
Nimrod that when the architect came to examine and pass the work before
giving them the certificate that would enable them to present their
account, he might remember the chandeliers and inquire what had become
of them.So they were again placed on the handcart, covered with sacks
and dust-sheets, taken back to the house and put up in the loft under
the roof so that, if he asked for them, there they were.The architect came, looked ever the house, passed the work, and gave
his certificate; he never mentioned or thought of the chandeliers.The
owner of the house was present and asked for Rushton's bill, for which
he at once gave them a cheque and Rushton and Misery almost grovelled
and wallowed on the ground before him.Throughout the whole interview
the architect and the 'gentleman' had kept their hats on, but Rushton
and Nimrod had been respectfully uncovered all the time, and as they
followed the other two about the house their bearing had been
expressive of the most abject servility.When the architect and the owner were gone the two chandeliers were
taken down again from under the roof, and put upon a handcart, covered
over with sacks and dust-sheets and taken back to the shop and again
placed for sale with the other stock.These are only a few of the petty thefts committed by these people.To
give anything approaching a full account of all the rest would require
a separate volume.As a result of all the hurrying and scamping, every now and again the
men found that they had worked themselves out of a job.Several times during the summer the firm had scarcely anything to do,
and nearly everybody had to stand off for a few days or weeks.When Newman got his first start in the early part of the year he had
only been working for about a fortnight when--with several others--he
was'stood off'.Fortunately, however, the day after he left Rushtons,
he was lucky enough to get a start for another firm, Driver and
Botchit, where he worked for nearly a month, and then he was again
given a job at Rushton's, who happened to be busy again.He did not have to lose much time, for he 'finished up' for Driver and
Botchit on a Thursday night and on the Friday he interviewed Misery,
who told him they were about to commence a fresh 'job' on the following
Monday morning at six o'clock, and that he could start with them.So
this time Newman was only out of work the Friday and Saturday, which
was another stroke of luck, because it often happens that a man has to
lose a week or more after 'finishing up' for one firm before he gets
another 'job'.All through the summer Crass continued to be the general 'colour-man',
most of his time being spent at the shop mixing up colours for all the
different 'jobs'.He also acted as a sort of lieutenant to Hunter,
who, as the reader has already been informed, was not a practical
painter.When there was a price to be given for some painting work,
Misery sometimes took Crass with him to look over it and help him to
estimate the amount of time and material it would take.Crass was thus
in a position of more than ordinary importance, not only being superior
to the 'hands', but also ranking above the other sub-foremen who had
charge of the 'jobs'.It was Crass and these sub-foremen who were to blame for most of the
scamping and driving, because if it had not been for them neither
Rushton nor Hunter would have known how to scheme the work.Of course, Hunter and Rushton wanted to drive and scamp, but not being
practical men they would not have known how if it had not been for
Crass and the others, who put them up to all the tricks of the trade.Crass knew that when the men stayed till half past seven they were in
the habit of ceasing work for a few minutes to eat a mouthful of grub
about six o'clock, so he suggested to Misery that as it was not
possible to stop this, it would be a good plan to make the men stop
work altogether from half past five till six, and lose half an hour's
pay; and to make up the time, instead of leaving off at seven-thirty,
they could work till eight.Misery had known of and winked at the former practice, for he knew that
the men could not work all that time without something to eat, but
Crass's suggestion seemed a much better way, and it was adopted.When the other masters in Mugsborough heard of this great reform they
all followed suit, and it became the rule in that town, whenever it was
necessary to work overtime, for the men to stay till eight instead of
half past seven as formerly, and they got no more pay than before.Previous to this summer it had been the almost invariable rule to have
two men in each room that was being painted, but Crass pointed out to
Misery that under such circumstances they wasted time talking to each
other, and they also acted as a check on one another: each of them
regulated the amount of work he did by the amount the other did, and if
the 'job' took too long it was always difficult to decide which of the
two was to blame: but if they were made to work alone, each of them
would be on his mettle; he would not know how much the others were
doing, and the fear of being considered slow in comparison with others
would make them all tear into it all they could.Misery thought this a very good idea, so the solitary system was
introduced, and as far as practicable, one room, one man became the
rule.They even tried to make the men distemper large ceilings single-handed,
and succeeded in one or two cases, but after several ceilings had been
spoilt and had to be washed off and done over again, they gave that up:
but nearly all the other work was now arranged on the'solitary
system', and it worked splendidly: each man was constantly in a state
of panic as to whether the others were doing more work than himself.Another suggestion that Crass made to Misery was that the sub-foremen
should be instructed never to send a man into a room to prepare it for
painting.'If you sends a man into a room to get it ready,' said Crass, ''e makes
a meal of it!'E spends as much time messin' about rubbin' down and
stoppin' up as it would take to paint it.But,' he added, with a
cunning leer, 'give 'em a bit of putty and a little bit of glass-paper,
and the paint at the stand, and then 'e gits it in 'is mind as 'e's
going in there to paint it!And 'e doesn't mess about much over the
preparing of it'.These and many other suggestions--all sorts of devices for scamping and
getting over the work--were schemed out by Crass and the other
sub-foremen, who put them into practice and showed them to Misery and
Rushton in the hope of currying favour with them and being 'kept on'.And between the lot of them they made life a veritable hell for
themselves, and the hands, and everybody else around them.And the
mainspring of it all was--the greed and selfishness of one man, who
desired to accumulate money!For this was the only object of all the
driving and bullying and hatred and cursing and unhappiness--to make
money for Rushton, who evidently considered himself a deserving case.It is sad and discreditable, but nevertheless true, that some of the
more selfish of the philanthropists often became weary of well-doing,
and lost all enthusiasm in the good cause.At such times they used to
say that they were 'Bloody well fed up' with the whole business and
'Tired of tearing their bloody guts out for the benefit of other
people' and every now and then some of these fellows would 'chuck up'
work, and go on the booze, sometimes stopping away for two or three
days or a week at a time.And then, when it was all over, they came
back, very penitent, to ask for another'start', but they generally
found that their places had been filled.If they happened to be good'sloggers'--men who made a practice of
'tearing their guts out' when they did work--they were usually
forgiven, and after being admonished by Misery, permitted to resume
work, with the understanding that if ever it occurred again they would
get the 'infernal'--which means the final and irrevocable--sack.There was once a job at a shop that had been a high-class restaurant
kept by a renowned Italian chef.It had been known as

                    'MACARONI'S ROYAL ITALIAN CAFE'

Situated on the Grand Parade, it was a favourite resort of the 'Elite',
who frequented it for afternoon tea and coffee and for little suppers
after the theatre.It had plate-glass windows, resplendent with gilding, marble-topped
tables with snow white covers, vases of flowers, and all the other
appurtenances of glittering cut glass and silver.The obsequious
waiters were in evening dress, the walls were covered with lofty
plate-glass mirrors in carved and gilded frames, and at certain hours
of the day and night an orchestra consisting of two violins and a harp
discoursed selections of classic music.But of late years the business had not been paying, and finally the
proprietor went bankrupt and was sold out.The place was shut up for
several months before the shop was let to a firm of dealers in fancy
articles, and the other part was transformed into flats.When the men went there to 'do
it up' they found the interior of the house in a state of indescribable
filth: the ceilings discoloured with smoke and hung with cobwebs, the
wallpapers smeared and black with grease, the handrails and the newel
posts of the staircase were clammy with filth, and the edges of the
doors near the handles were blackened with greasy dirt and
finger-marks.The tops of the skirtings, the mouldings of the doors,
the sashes of the windows and the corners of the floors were thick with
the accumulated dust of years.In one of the upper rooms which had evidently been used as a nursery or
playroom for the children of the renowned chef, the wallpaper for about
two feet above the skirting was blackened with grease and ornamented
with childish drawings made with burnt sticks and blacklead pencils,
the door being covered with similar artistic efforts, to say nothing of
some rude attempts at carving, evidently executed with an axe or a
hammer.But all this filth was nothing compared with the unspeakable
condition of the kitchen and scullery, a detailed description of which
would cause the blood of the reader to curdle, and each particular hair
of his head to stand on end.Let it suffice to say that the walls, the ceiling, the floor, the
paintwork, the gas-stove, the kitchen range, the dresser and everything
else were uniformly absolutely and literally--black.And the black was
composed of soot and grease.In front of the window there was a fixture--a kind of bench or table,
deeply scored with marks of knives like a butcher's block.The sill of
the window was about six inches lower than the top of the table, so
that between the glass of the lower sash of the window, which had
evidently never been raised, and the back of the table, there was a
long narrow cavity or trough, about six inches deep, four inches wide
and as long as the width of the window, the sill forming the bottom of
the cavity.This trough was filled with all manner of abominations: fragments of
fat and decomposed meat, legs of rabbits and fowls, vegetable matter,
broken knives and forks, and hair: and the glass of the window was
caked with filth of the same description.This job was the cause of the sacking of the Semi-drunk and another man
named Bill Bates, who were sent into the kitchen to clean it down and
prepare it for painting and distempering.They commenced to do it, but it made them feel so ill that they went
out and had a pint each, and after that they made another start at it.But it was not long before they felt that it was imperatively necessary
to have another drink.So they went over to the pub, and this time
they had two pints each.Bill paid for the first two and then the
Semi-drunk refused to return to work unless Bill would consent to have
another pint with him before going back.When they had drunk the two
pints, they decided--in order to save themselves the trouble and risk
of coming away from the job--to take a couple of quarts back with them
in two bottles, which the landlord of the pub lent them, charging
twopence on each bottle, to be refunded when they were returned.When they got back to the job they found the 'coddy' in the kitchen,
looking for them and he began to talk and grumble, but the Semi-drunk
soon shut him up: he told him he could either have a drink out of one
of the bottles or a punch in the bloody nose--whichever he liked!Or
if he did not fancy either of these alternatives, he could go to hell!As the 'coddy' was a sensible man he took the beer and advised them to
pull themselves together and try to get some work done before Misery
came, which they promised to do.When the 'coddy' was gone they made another attempt at the work.Misery
came a little while afterwards and began shouting at them because he
said he could not see what they had done.It looked as if they had
been asleep all the morning: Here it was nearly ten o'clock, and as far
as he could see, they had done Nothing!When he was gone they drank the rest of the beer and then they began to
feel inclined to laugh.What did they care for Hunter or Rushton
either?They left off scraping and
scrubbing, and began throwing buckets of water over the dresser and the
walls, laughing uproariously all the time.'We'll show the b--s how to wash down paintwork!'shouted the
Semi-drunk, as he stood in the middle of the room and hurled a pailful
of water over the door of the cupboard.'Bring us another bucket of
water, Bill.'Bill was out in the scullery filling his pail under the tap, and
laughing so much that he could scarcely stand.As soon as it was full
he passed it to the Semi-drunk, who threw it bodily, pail and all, on
to the bench in front of the window, smashing one of the panes of
glass.The water poured off the table and all over the floor.Bill brought the next pailful in and threw it at the kitchen door,
splitting one of the panels from top to bottom, and then they threw
about half a dozen more pailfuls over the dresser.'We'll show the b--rs how to clean paintwork,' they shouted, as they
hurled the buckets at the walls and doors.By this time the floor was deluged with water, which mingled with the
filth and formed a sea of mud.They left the two taps running in the scullery and as the waste pipe of
the sink was choked up with dirt, the sink filled up and overflowed
like a miniature Niagara.The water ran out under the doors into the back-yard, and along the
passage out to the front door.But Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk
remained in the kitchen, smashing the pails at the walls and doors and
the dresser, and cursing and laughing hysterically.They had just filled the two buckets and were bringing them into the
kitchen when they heard Hunter's voice in the passage, shouting out
inquiries as to where all that water came from.Then they heard him
advancing towards them and they stood waiting for him with the pails in
their hands, and directly he opened the door and put his head into the
room they let fly the two pails at him.Unfortunately, they were too
drunk and excited to aim straight.One pail struck the middle rail of
the door and the other the wall by the side of it.Misery hastily shut the door again and ran upstairs, and presently the
'coddy' came down and called out to them from the passage.They went out to see what he wanted, and he told them that Misery had
gone to the office to get their wages ready: they were to make out
their time sheets and go for their money at once.Misery had said that
if they were not there in ten minutes he would have the pair of them
locked up.The Semi-drunk said that nothing would suit them better than to have
all their pieces at once--they had spent all their money and wanted
another drink.Bill Bates concurred, so they borrowed a piece of
blacklead pencil from the 'coddy' and made out their time sheets, took
off their aprons, put them into their tool bags, and went to the office
for their money, which Misery passed out to them through the trap-door.The news of this exploit spread all over the town during that day and
evening, and although it was in July, the next morning at six o'clock
there were half a dozen men waiting at the yard to ask Misery if there
was 'any chance of a job'.Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk had had their spree and had got the sack
for it and most of the chaps said it served them right.Such conduct
as that was going too far.Most of them would have said the same thing no matter what the
circumstances might have been.They had very little sympathy for each
other at any time.Often, when, for instance, one man was sent away from one 'job' to
another, the others would go into his room and look at the work he had
been doing, and pick out all the faults they could find and show them
to each other, making all sorts of ill-natured remarks about the absent
one meanwhile.'Jist run yer nose over that door, Jim,' one would say
in a tone of disgust.Did yer ever see sich a
mess in yer life?And the other man would
shake his head sadly and say that although the one who had done it had
never been up to much as a workman, he could do it a bit better than
that if he liked, but the fact was that he never gave himself time to
do anything properly: he was always tearing his bloody guts out!Why,
he'd only been in this room about four hours from start to finish!He
ought to have a watering cart to follow him about, because he worked at
such a hell of a rate you couldn't see him for dust!And then the
first man would reply that other people could do as they liked, but for
his part, HE was not going to tear his guts out for nobody!The second man would applaud these sentiments and say that he wasn't
going to tear his out either: and then they would both go back to their
respective rooms and tear into the work for all they were worth, making
the same sort of 'job' as the one they had been criticizing, and
afterwards, when the other's back was turned, each of them in turn
would sneak into the other's room and criticize it and point out the
faults to anyone else who happened to be near at hand.Harlow was working at the place that had been Macaroni's Cafe when one
day a note was sent to him from Hunter at the shop.It was written on
a scrap of wallpaper, and worded in the usual manner of such notes--as
if the writer had studied how to avoid all suspicion of being unduly
civil:

    Harlow go to the yard at once take your tools with you.Crass will tell you where you have to go.They were just finishing their dinners when the boy brought this note;
and after reading it aloud for the benefit of the others, Harlow
remarked that it was worded in much the same way in which one would
speak to a dog.The others said nothing; but after he was gone the
other men--who all considered that it was ridiculous for the 'likes of
us' to expect or wish to be treated with common civility--laughed about
it, and said that Harlow was beginning to think he was Somebody: they
supposed it was through readin' all those books what Owen was always
lendin' 'im.And then one of them got a piece of paper and wrote a
note to be given to Harlow at the first opportunity.This note was
properly worded, written in a manner suitable for a gentleman like him,
neatly folded and addressed:


    Mr Harlow Esq.,
      c/o Macaroni's Royal Cafe
        till called for.Mister Harlow,
      Dear Sir: Wood you kinely oblige me bi cummin to the paint shop
    as soon as you can make it convenient as there is a sealin' to be
    wite-woshed hoppin this is not trubbling you to much

                                                  I remane
                                                  Yours respeckfully
                                                       Pontius Pilate.This note was read out for the amusement of the company and afterwards
stored away in the writer's pocket till such a time as an opportunity
should occur of giving it to Harlow.As the writer of the note was on his way back to his room to resume
work he was accosted by a man who had gone into Harlow's room to
criticize it, and had succeeded in finding several faults which he
pointed out to the other, and of course they were both very much
disgusted with Harlow.'I can't think why the coddy keeps him on the job,' said the first man.'Between you and me, if I had charge of a job, and Misery sent Harlow
there--I'd send 'im back to the shop.''Same as you,' agreed the other as he went back to tear into his own
room.'Same as you, old man: I shouldn't 'ave 'im neither.'It must not be supposed from this that either of these two men were on
exceptionally bad terms with Harlow; they were just as good friends
with him--to his face--as they were with each other--to each other's
faces--and it was just their way: that was all.If it had been one or both of these two who had gone away instead of
Harlow, just the same things would have been said about them by the
others who remained--it was merely their usual way of speaking about
each other behind each other's backs.It was always the same: if any one of them made a mistake or had an
accident or got into any trouble he seldom or never got any sympathy
from his fellow workmen.On the contrary, most of them at such times
seemed rather pleased than otherwise.There was a poor devil--a stranger in the town; he came from
London--who got the sack for breaking some glass.He had been sent to
'burn off' some old paint of the woodwork of a window.He was not very
skilful in the use of the burning-off lamp, because on the firm when he
had been working in London it was a job that the ordinary hands were
seldom or never called upon to do.There were one or two men who did
it all.For that matter, not many of Rushton's men were very skilful
at it either.It was a job everybody tried to get out of, because
nearly always the lamp went wrong and there was a row about the time
the work took.So they worked this job on to the stranger.This man had been out of work for a long time before he got a start at
Rushton's, and he was very anxious not to lose the job, because he had
a wife and family in London.When the 'coddy' told him to go and burn
off this window he did not like to say that he was not used to the
work: he hoped to be able to do it.But he was very nervous, and the
end was that although he managed to do the burning off all right, just
as he was finishing he accidentally allowed the flame of the lamp to
come into contact with a large pane of glass and broke it.They sent to the shop for a new pane of glass, and the man stayed late
that night and put it in in his own time, thus bearing half the cost of
repairing it.Things were not very busy just then, and on the following Saturday two
of the hands were'stood off'.The stranger was one of them, and
nearly everybody was very pleased.At mealtimes the story of the
broken window was repeatedly told amid jeering laughter.It really
seemed as if a certain amount of indignation was felt that a
stranger--especially such an inferior person as this chap who did not
know how to use a lamp--should have had the cheek to try to earn his
living at all!One thing was very certain--they said, gleefully--he
would never get another job at Rushton's: that was one good thing.And yet they all knew that this accident might have happened to any one
of them.Once a couple of men got the sack because a ceiling they distempered
had to be washed off and done again.It was not really the men's fault
at all: it was a ceiling that needed special treatment and they had not
been allowed to do it properly.But all the same, when they got the sack most of the others laughed and
sneered and were glad.Perhaps because they thought that the fact that
these two unfortunates had been disgraced, increased their own chances
of being 'kept on'.With a few
exceptions, they had an immense amount of respect for Rushton and
Hunter, and very little respect or sympathy for each other.Exactly the same lack of feeling for each other prevailed amongst the
members of all the different trades.Everybody seemed glad if anybody
got into trouble for any reason whatever.There was a garden gate that had been made at the carpenter's shop: it
was not very well put together, and for the usual reason; the man had
not been allowed the time to do it properly.After it was fixed, one
of his shopmates wrote upon it with lead pencil in big letters: 'This
is good work for a joiner.But to hear them talking in the pub of a Saturday afternoon just after
pay-time one would think them the best friends and mates and the most
independent spirits in the world, fellows whom it would be very
dangerous to trifle with, and who would stick up for each other through
thick and thin.All sorts of stories were related of the wonderful
things they had done and said; of jobs they had 'chucked up', and
masters they had 'told off': of pails of whitewash thrown over
offending employers, and of horrible assaults and batteries committed
upon the same.But strange to say, for some reason or other, it seldom
happened that a third party ever witnessed any of these prodigies.It
seemed as if a chivalrous desire to spare the feelings of their victims
had always prevented them from doing or saying anything to them in the
presence of witnesses.When he had drunk a few pints, Crass was a very good hand at these
stories.Here is one that he told in the bar of the Cricketers on the
Saturday afternoon of the same week that Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk
got the sack.The Cricketers was only a few minutes walk from the shop
and at pay-time a number of the men used to go in there to take a drink
before going home.'Last Thursday night about five o'clock, 'Unter comes inter the
paint-shop an' ses to me, "I wants a pail o' wash made up tonight,
Crass," 'e ses, "ready for fust thing in the mornin'," 'e ses."Oh," I
ses, lookin' 'im straight in the bloody eye, "Oh, yer do, do
yer?""Well, you can bloody well make
it yerself!"I ses, "'cos I ain't agoin' to," I ses--just like that."Wot the 'ell do yer mean," I ses, "by comin' 'ere at this time o'
night with a order like that?"You'd a larfed,' continued
Crass, as he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand after taking
another drink out of his glass, and looking round to note the effect of
the story, 'you'd a larfed if you'd bin there.'E was fairly
flabbergasted!And wen I said that to 'im I see 'is jaw drop!An'
then 'e started apoligizing and said as 'e 'adn't meant no offence, but
I told 'im bloody straight not to come no more of it."You bring the
horder at a reasonable time," I ses--just like that--"and I'll attend
to it," I ses, "but not otherwise," I ses.'As he concluded this story, Crass drained his glass and gazed round
upon the audience, who were full of admiration.They looked at each
other and at Crass and nodded their heads approvingly.Yes,
undoubtedly, that was the proper way to deal with such bounders as
Nimrod; take up a strong attitude, an' let 'em see as you'll stand no
nonsense!'Yer don't blame me, do yer?''Why should we put up
with a lot of old buck from the likes of 'im!We're not a lot of
bloody Chinamen, are we?'So far from blaming him, they all assured him that they would have
acted in precisely the same way under similar circumstances.'For my part, I'm a bloke like this,' said a tall man with a very loud
voice--a chap who nearly fell down dead every time Rushton or Misery
looked at him.'I'm a bloke like this 'ere: I never stands no cheek
from no gaffers!If a guv'nor ses two bloody words to me, I downs me
tools and I ses to 'im, "Wot!Don't I suit yer, guv'ner?Ain't I done
enuff for yer?Gimmie me bleedin' a'pence."'If
only everyone would do the same as the tall man--who had just paid for
another round of drinks--things would be a lot more comfortable than
they was.'Last summer I was workin' for ole Buncer,' said a little man with a
cutaway coat several sizes too large for him.'I was workin' for ole
Buncer, over at Windley, an' you all knows as 'e don't arf lower it.Well, one day, when I knowed 'e was on the drunk, I 'ad to first coat a
room out--white; so thinks I to meself, "If I buck up I shall be able
to get this lot done by about four o'clock, an' then I can clear orf
'ome.'Cos I reckoned as 'e'd be about flattened out by that time, an'
you know 'e ain't got no foreman.So I tears into it an' gets this
'ere room done about a quarter past four, an' I'd just got me things
put away for the night w'en 'oo should come fallin' up the bloody
stairs but ole Buncer, drunk as a howl!An' no sooner 'e gits inter
the room than 'e starts yappin' an' rampin'.""Is this 'ere hall
you've done?""Wotcher bin up to hall day?"'e ses, an'
'e keeps on shouting' an' swearin' till at last I couldn't stand it no
longer, 'cos you can guess I wasn't in a very good temper with 'im
comin' along jist then w'en I thought I was goin' to get orf a bit
early--so w'en 'e kept on shoutin' I never made no answer to 'im, but
ups with me fist an' I gives 'im a slosh in the dial an' stopped 'is
clock!Then I chucked the pot o' w'ite paint hover 'im, an' kicked 'im
down the bloody stairs.''Serve 'im blooming well right, too,' said Crass as he took a fresh
glass of beer from one of the others, who had just'stood' another
round.'What did the b--r say to that?'replied the little man, ''E picked 'isself up, and
called a keb wot was passin' an' got inter it an' went 'ome; an' I
never seen no more of 'im until about 'arf-past eleven the next day,
w'en I was second-coatin' the room, an' 'e comes up with a noo suit o'
clothes on, an' arsts me if I'd like to come hover to the pub an' 'ave
a drink?So we goes hover, an' 'e calls for a w'iskey an' soda for
isself an' arsts me wot I'd 'ave, so I 'ad the same.An' w'ile we was
gettin' it down us, 'e ses to me, "Ah, Garge," 'e ses."You losed your
temper with me yesterday,"' 'e ses.'If you 'adn't served 'im as you did you'd most likely 'ave 'ad to
put up with a lot more ole buck.'They all agreed that the little man had done quite right: they all said
that they didn' blame him in the least: they would all have done the
same: in fact, this was the way they all conducted themselves whenever
occasion demanded it.To hear them talk, one would imagine that such
affairs as the recent exploit of Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk were
constantly taking place, instead of only occurring about once in a blue
moon.Crass stood the final round of drinks, and as he evidently thought that
circumstance deserved to be signalized in some special manner, he
proposed the following toast, which was drunk with enthusiasm:

        'To hell with the man,
        May he never grow fat,
        What carries two faces,
        Under one 'at.'They did not have many
big jobs, but there were a lot of little ones, and the boy Bert was
kept busy running from one to the other.He spent most of his time
dragging a handcart with loads of paint, or planks and steps, and
seldom went out to work with the men, for when he was not taking things
out to the various places where the philanthropists were working, he
was in the paintshop at the yard, scraping out dirty paint-pots or
helping Crass to mix up colours.Although scarcely anyone seemed to
notice it, the boy presented a truly pitiable spectacle.Dragging the handcart did not help him to put on flesh,
for the weather was very hot and the work made him sweat.His home was right away on the other side of Windley.It took him more
than three-quarters of an hour to walk to the shop, and as he had to be
at work at six, that meant that he had to leave home at a few minutes
past five every morning, so that he always got up about half past four.He was wearing a man's coat--or rather jacket--which gave the upper
part of his body a bulky appearance.The trousers were part of a suit
of his own, and were somewhat narrowly cut, as is the rule with boys'
cheap ready-made trousers.These thin legs appearing under the big
jacket gave him a rather grotesque appearance, which was heightened by
the fact that all his clothes, cap, coat, waistcoat, trousers and
boots, were smothered with paint and distemper of various colours, and
there were generally a few streaks of paint of some sort or other upon
his face, and of course his hands--especially round the
fingernails--were grimed with it.But the worst of all were the
dreadful hobnailed boots: the leather of the uppers of these was an
eighth of an inch thick, and very stiff.Across the fore part of the
boot this hard leather had warped into ridges and valleys, which chafed
his feet, and made them bleed.The soles were five-eighths of an inch
thick, covered with hobnails, and were as hard and inflexible and
almost as heavy as iron.These boots hurt his feet dreadfully and made
him feel very tired and miserable, for he had such a lot of walking to
do.He used to be jolly glad when dinner-time came, for then he used to
get out of sight in some quiet spot and lie down for the whole hour.His favourite dining-place was up in the loft over the carpenter's
shop, where they stored the mouldings and architraves.No one ever
came there at that hour, and after he had eaten his dinner he used to
lie down and think and rest.He nearly always had an hour for dinner, but he did not always have it
at the same time: sometimes he had it at twelve o'clock and sometimes
not till two.It all depended upon what stuff had to be taken to the
job.Often it happened that some men at a distant job required some material
to use immediately after dinner, and perhaps Crass was not able to get
it ready till twelve o'clock, so that it was not possible to take it
before dinner-time, and if Bert left it till after dinner the men would
be wasting their time waiting for it: so in such cases he took it there
first and had his dinner when he came back.Sometimes he got back about half past twelve, and it was necessary for
him to take out another lot of material at one o'clock.In such a case he 'charged' half an hour overtime on his time sheet--he
used to get twopence an hour for overtime.Sometimes Crass sent him with a handcart to one job to get a pair of
steps or tressels, or a plank, or some material or other, and take them
to another job, and on these occasions it was often very late before he
was able to take his meals.Instead of getting his breakfast at eight,
it was often nearly nine before he got back to the shop, and frequently
he had to go without dinner until half past one or two.Sometimes he could scarcely manage to carry the pots of paint to the
jobs; his feet were so hot and sore.When he had to push the cart it
was worse still, and often when knocking-off time came he felt so tired
that he could scarcely manage to walk home.But the weather was not always hot or fine: sometimes it was quite
cold, almost like winter, and there was a lot of rain that summer.At
such times the boy frequently got wet through several times a day as he
went from one job to another, and he had to work all the time in his
wet clothes and boots, which were usually old and out of repair and let
in the water.One of the worst jobs that he had to do was when a new stock of white
lead came in.This stuff came in wooden barrels containing two
hundredweight, and he used to have to dig it out of these barrels with
a trowel, and put it into a metal tank, where it was kept covered with
water, and the empty barrels were returned to the makers.When he was doing this work he usually managed to get himself smeared
all over with the white lead, and this circumstance, and the fact that
he was always handling paint or some poisonous material or other was
doubtless the cause of the terrible pains he often had in his
stomach--pains that sometimes caused him to throw himself down and roll
on the ground in agony.One afternoon Crass sent him with a handcart to a job that Easton,
Philpot, Harlow and Owen were just finishing.He got there about half
past four and helped the men to load up the things, and afterwards
walked alongside the cart with them back to the shop.On the way they all noticed and remarked to each other that the boy
looked tired and pale and that he seemed to limp: but he did not say
anything, although he guessed that they were talking about him.They
arrived at the shop a little before knocking-off time--about ten
minutes past five.Bert helped them to unload, and afterwards, while
they were putting their things away and 'charging up' the unused
materials they had brought back, he pushed the cart over to the shed
where it was kept, on the other side of the yard.He did not return to
the shop at once and a few minutes later when Harlow came out into the
yard to get a bucket of water to wash their hands with, he saw the boy
leaning on the side of the cart, crying, and holding one foot off the
ground.Harlow asked him what was the matter, and while he was speaking to him
the others came out to see what was up: the boy said he had rheumatism
or growing pains or something in his leg, 'just here near the knee'.But he didn't say much, he just cried miserably, and turned his head
slowly from side to side, avoiding the looks of the men because he felt
ashamed that they should see him cry.When they saw how ill and miserable he looked, the men all put their
hands in their pockets to get some coppers to give to him so that he
could ride home on the tram.They gave him fivepence altogether, more
than enough to ride all the way; and Crass told him to go at
once--there was no need to wait till half past; but before he went
Philpot got a small glass bottle out of his tool bag and filled it with
oil and turps--two of turps and one of oil--which he gave to Bert to
rub into his leg before going to bed: The turps--he explained--was to
cure the pain and the oil was to prevent it from hurting the skin.He
was to get his mother to rub it in for him if he were too tired to do
it himself.Bert promised to observe these directions, and, drying his
tears, took his dinner basket and limped off to catch the tram.It was a few days after this that Hunter met with an accident.He was
tearing off on his bicycle to one of the jobs about five minutes to
twelve to see if he could catch anyone leaving off for dinner before
the proper time, and while going down a rather steep hill the
front brake broke--the rubbers of the rear one were worn out and failed
to act--so Misery to save himself from being smashed against the
railings of the houses at the bottom of the hill, threw himself off the
machine, with the result that his head and face and hands were terribly
cut and bruised.He was so badly knocked about that he had to remain
at home for nearly three weeks, much to the delight of the men and the
annoyance--one might even say the indignation--of Mr Rushton, who did
not know enough about the work to make out estimates without
assistance.There were several large jobs to be tendered for at the
same time, so Rushton sent the specifications round to Hunter's house
for him to figure out the prices, and nearly all the time that Misery
was at home he was sitting up in bed, swathed in bandages, trying to
calculate the probable cost of these jobs.Rushton did not come to see
him, but he sent Bert nearly every day, either with some
specifications, or some accounts, or something of that sort, or with a
note inquiring when Hunter thought he would be able to return to work.All sorts of rumours became prevalent amongst the men concerning
Hunter's condition.He had 'broken his spiral column', he had
'conjunction of the brain', or he had injured his 'innards' and would
probably never be able to 'do no more slave-drivin''.Crass--who had
helped Mr Rushton to 'price up' several small jobs--began to think it
might not be altogether a bad thing for himself if something were to
happen to Hunter, and he began to put on side and to assume airs of
authority.He got one of the light-weights to assist him in his work
of colourman and made him do all the hard work, while he spent part of
his own time visiting the different jobs to see how the work progressed.He was wearing a pair of sporting
trousers the pattern of which consisted of large black and white
squares.The previous owner of these trousers was taller and slighter
than Crass, so although the legs were about a couple of inches too
long, they fitted him rather tightly, so much so that it was fortunate
that he had his present job of colourman, for if he had had to do any
climbing up and down ladders or steps, the trousers would have burst.His jacket was also two or three sizes too small, and the sleeves were
so short that the cuffs of his flanelette shirt were visible.This
coat was made of serge, and its colour had presumably once been blue,
but it was now a sort of heliotrope and violet: the greater part being
of the former tint, and the parts under the sleeves of the latter.This
jacket fitted very tightly across the shoulders and back and being much
too short left his tightly clad posteriors exposed to view.He however seemed quite unconscious of anything peculiar in his
appearance and was so bumptious and offensive that most of the men were
almost glad when Nimrod came back.They said that if Crass ever got
the job he would be a dam' sight worse than Hunter.As for the latter,
for a little while after his return to work it was said that his
illness had improved his character: he had had time to think things
over; and in short, he was ever so much better than before: but it was
not long before this story began to be told the other way round.and a thing that happened about a fortnight after
his return caused more ill feeling and resentment against him and
Rushton than had ever existed previously.What led up to it was
something that was done by Bundy's mate, Ted Dawson.This poor wretch was scarcely ever seen without a load of some sort or
other: carrying a sack of cement or plaster, a heavy ladder, a big
bucket of mortar, or dragging a load of scaffolding on a cart.He must
have been nearly as strong as a horse, because after working in this
manner for Rushton & Co.from six in the morning till half past five at
night, he usually went to work in his garden for two or three hours
after tea, and frequently went there for an hour or so in the morning
before going to work.The poor devil needed the produce of his garden
to supplement his wages, for he had a wife and three children to
provide for and he earned only--or rather, to be correct, he was paid
only--fourpence an hour.There was an old house to which they were making some alterations and
repairs, and there was a lot of old wood taken out of it: old, decayed
floorboards and stuff of that kind, wood that was of no use whatever
except to burn.Bundy and his mate were working there, and one night, Misery came a few
minutes before half past five and caught Dawson in the act of tying up
a small bundle of this wood.When Hunter asked him what he was going
to do with it he made no attempt at prevarication or concealment: he
said he was going to take it home for fire-wood, because it was of no
other use.Misery kicked up a devil of a row and ordered him to leave
the wood where it was: it had to be taken to the yard, and it was
nothing to do with Dawson or anyone else whether it was any use or not!If he caught anyone taking wood away he would sack them on the spot.Hunter shouted very loud so that all the others might hear, and as they
were all listening attentively in the next room, where they were taking
their aprons off preparatory to going home, they got the full benefit
of his remarks.The following Saturday when the hands went to the office for their
money they were each presented with a printed card bearing the
following legend:

    Under no circumstances is any article or material, however
    trifling, to be taken away by workmen for their private use,
    whether waste material or not, from any workshop or place where
    work is being done.Foremen are hereby instructed to see that
    this order is obeyed and to report any such act coming to their
    knowledge.Any man breaking this rule will be either dismissed
    without notice or given into custody.Most of the men took these cards with the envelopes containing their
wages and walked away without making any comment--in fact, most of them
were some distance away before they realized exactly what the card was
about.Two or three of them stood a few steps away from the pay window
in full view of Rushton and Misery and ostentatiously tore the thing
into pieces and threw them into the street.One man remained at the
pay window while he read the card--and then flung it with an obscene
curse into Rushton's face, and demanded his back day, which they gave
him without any remark or delay, the other men who were not yet paid
having to wait while he made out his time-sheet for that morning.The story of this card spread all over the place in a very short time.It became the talk of every shop in the town.Whenever any of
Rushton's men encountered the employees of another firm, the latter
used to shout after them--'However trifling!''Ere comes some of Rushton's pickpockets.'Amongst Rushton's men themselves it became a standing joke or form of
greeting to say when one met another--'Remember!If one of their number was seen going home with an unusual amount of
paint or whitewash on his hands or clothes, the others would threaten
to report him for stealing the material.They used to say that however
trifling the quantity, it was against orders to take it away.Harlow drew up a list of rules which he said Mr Rushton had instructed
him to communicate to the men.One of these rules provided that
everybody was to be weighed upon arrival at the job in the morning and
again at leaving-off time: any man found to have increased in weight
was to be discharged.There was also much cursing and covert resentment about it; the men
used to say that such a thing as that looked well coming from the likes
of Rushton and Hunter, and they used to remind each other of the affair
of the marble-topped console table, the barometer, the venetian blinds
and all the other robberies.None of them ever said anything to either Misery or Rushton about the
cards, but one morning when the latter was reading his letters at the
breakfast table, on opening one of them he found that it contained one
of the notices, smeared with human excrement.He did not eat any more
breakfast that morning.It was not to be much wondered at that none of them had the courage to
openly resent the conditions under which they had to work, for although
it was summer, there were many men out of employment, and it was much
easier to get the sack than it was to get another job.None of the men were ever caught stealing anything, however trifling,
but all the same during the course of the summer five or six of them
were captured by the police and sent to jail--for not being able to pay
their poor rates.All through the summer Owen continued to make himself objectionable and
to incur the ridicule of his fellow workmen by talking about the causes
of poverty and of ways to abolish it.Most of the men kept two shillings or half a crown of their wages back
from their wives for pocket money, which they spent on beer and
tobacco.There were a very few who spent a little more than this, and
there were a still smaller number who spent so much in this way that
their families had to suffer in consequence.Most of those who kept back half a crown or three shillings from their
wives did so on the understanding that they were to buy their clothing
out of it.Some of them had to pay a shilling a week to a tallyman or
credit clothier.These were the ones who indulged in shoddy new
suits--at long intervals.Others bought--or got their wives to buy for
them--their clothes at second-hand shops, 'paying off' about a shilling
or so a week and not receiving the things till they were paid for.There were a very large proportion of them who did not spend even a
shilling a week for drink: and there were numerous others who, while
not being formally total abstainers, yet often went for weeks together
without either entering a public house or tasting intoxicating drink in
any form.Then there were others who, instead of drinking tea or coffee or cocoa
with their dinners or suppers, drank beer.This did not cost more than
the teetotal drinks, but all the same there are some persons who say
that those who swell the 'Nation's Drink Bill' by drinking beer with
their dinners or suppers are a kind of criminal, and that they ought to
be compelled to drink something else: that is, if they are working
people.As for the idle classes, they of course are to be allowed to
continue to make merry, 'drinking whisky, wine and sherry', to say
nothing of having their beer in by the barrel and the dozen--or forty
dozen--bottles.But of course that's a different matter, because these
people make so much money out of the labour of the working classes that
they can afford to indulge in this way without depriving their children
of the necessaries of life.There is no more cowardly, dastardly slander than is contained in the
assertion that the majority or any considerable proportion of working
men neglect their families through drink.There
are some who do, but they are not even a large minority.They are few
and far between, and are regarded with contempt by their fellow workmen.It will be said that their families had to suffer for want of even the
little that most of them spent in that way: but the persons that use
this argument should carry it to its logical conclusion.Tea is an
unnecessary and harmful drink; it has been condemned by medical men so
often that to enumerate its evil qualities here would be waste of time.The same can be said of nearly all the cheap temperance drinks; they
are unnecessary and harmful and cost money, and, like beer, are drunk
only for pleasure.What right has anyone to say to working men that when their work is
done they should not find pleasure in drinking a glass or two of beer
together in a tavern or anywhere else?Let those who would presume to
condemn them carry their argument to its logical conclusion and condemn
pleasure of every kind.Let them persuade the working classes to lead
still simpler lives; to drink water instead of such unwholesome things
as tea, coffee, beer, lemonade and all the other harmful and
unnecessary stuff.They would then be able to live ever so much more
cheaply, and as wages are always and everywhere regulated by the cost
of living, they would be able to work for lower pay.These people are fond of quoting the figures of the 'Nation's Drink
Bill,' as if all this money were spent by the working classes!But if
the amount of money spent in drink by the 'aristocracy', the clergy and
the middle classes were deducted from the 'Nation's Drink Bill', it
would be seen that the amount spent per head by the working classes is
not so alarming after all; and would probably not be much larger than
the amount spent on drink by those who consume tea and coffee and all
the other unwholesome and unnecessary 'temperance' drinks.The fact that some of Rushton's men spent about two shillings a week on
drink while they were in employment was not the cause of their poverty.If they had never spent a farthing for drink, and if their wretched
wages had been increased fifty percent, they would still have been in a
condition of the most abject and miserable poverty, for nearly all the
benefits and privileges of civilization, nearly everything that makes
life worth living, would still have been beyond their reach.It is inevitable, so long as men have to live and work under such
heartbreaking, uninteresting conditions as at present that a certain
proportion of them will seek forgetfulness and momentary happiness in
the tavern, and the only remedy for this evil is to remove the cause;
and while that is in process, there is something else that can be done
and that is, instead of allowing filthy drinking dens, presided over by
persons whose interest it is to encourage men to drink more bad beer
than is good for them or than they can afford,--to have civilized
institutions run by the State or the municipalities for use and not
merely for profit.Decent pleasure houses, where no drunkenness or
filthiness would be tolerated--where one could buy real beer or coffee
or tea or any other refreshments; where men could repair when their
day's work was over and spend an hour or two in rational intercourse
with their fellows or listen to music and singing.Taverns to which
they could take their wives and children without fear of defilement,
for a place that is not fit for the presence of a woman or a child is
not fit to exist at all.Owen, being a teetotaller, did not spend any of his money on drink; but
he spent a lot on what he called 'The Cause'.Every week he bought
some penny or twopenny pamphlets or some leaflets about Socialism,
which he lent or gave to his mates; and in this way and by means of
much talk he succeeded in converting a few to his party.Philpot,
Harlow and a few others used to listen with interest, and some of them
even paid for the pamphlets they obtained from Owen, and after reading
them themselves, passed them on to others, and also occasionally 'got
up' arguments on their own accounts.Others were simply indifferent,
or treated the subject as a kind of joke, ridiculing the suggestion
that it was possible to abolish poverty.They repeated that there had
'always been rich and poor in the world and there always would be, so
there was an end of it'.But the majority were bitterly hostile; not
to Owen, but to Socialism.For the man himself most of them had a
certain amount of liking, especially the ordinary hands because it was
known that he was not a'master's man' and that he had declined to
'take charge' of jobs which Misery had offered to him.But to
Socialism they were savagely and malignantly opposed.Some of those
who had shown some symptoms of Socialism during the past winter when
they were starving had now quite recovered and were stout defenders of
the Present System.Barrington was still working for the firm and continued to maintain his
manner of reserve, seldom speaking unless addressed but all the same,
for several reasons, it began to be rumoured that he shared Owen's
views.He always paid for the pamphlets that Owen gave him, and on one
occasion, when Owen bought a thousand leaflets to give away, Barrington
contributed a shilling towards the half-crown that Owen paid for them.But he never took any part in the arguments that sometimes raged during
the dinner-hour or at breakfast-time.It was a good thing for Owen that he had his enthusiasm for 'the cause'
to occupy his mind.Socialism was to him what drink was to some of the
others--the thing that enable them to forget and tolerate the
conditions under which they were forced to exist.Some of them were so
muddled with beer, and others so besotted with admiration of their
Liberal and Tory masters, that they were oblivious of the misery of
their own lives, and in a similar way, Owen was so much occupied in
trying to rouse them from their lethargy and so engrossed in trying to
think out new arguments to convince them of the possibility of bringing
about an improvement in their condition that he had no time to dwell
upon his own poverty; the money that he spent on leaflets and pamphlets
to give away might have been better spent on food and clothing for
himself, because most of those to whom he gave them were by no means
grateful; but he never thought of that; and after all, nearly everyone
spends money on some hobby or other.Some people deny themselves the
necessaries or comforts of life in order that they may be able to help
to fatten a publican.Others deny themselves in order to enable a lazy
parson to live in idleness and luxury; and others spend much time and
money that they really need for themselves in buying Socialist
literature to give away to people who don't want to know about
Socialism.One Sunday morning towards the end of July, a band of about twenty-five
men and women on bicycles invaded the town.Two of them--who rode a
few yards in front of the others, had affixed to the handlebars of each
of their machines a slender, upright standard from the top of one of
which fluttered a small flag of crimson silk with 'International
Brotherhood and Peace' in gold letters.The other standard was similar
in size and colour, but with a different legend: 'One for all and All
for one.'As they rode along they gave leaflets to the people in the streets, and
whenever they came to a place where there were many people they
dismounted and walked about, giving their leaflets to whoever would
accept them.They made several long halts during their progress along
the Grand Parade, where there was a considerable crowd, and then they
rode over the hill to Windley, which they reached a little before
opening time.There were little crowds waiting outside the several
public houses and a number of people passing through the streets on
their way home from Church and Chapel.The strangers distributed
leaflets to all those who would take them, and they went through a lot
of the side streets, putting leaflets under the doors and in the
letter-boxes.When they had exhausted their stock they remounted and
rode back the way they came.Meantime the news of their arrival had spread, and as they returned
through the town they were greeted with jeers and booing.Presently
someone threw a stone, and as there happened to be plenty of stones
just there several others followed suit and began running after the
retreating cyclists, throwing stones, hooting and cursing.The leaflet which had given rise to all this fury read as follows:

                            WHAT IS SOCIALISM?At present the workers, with hand and brain produce continually
    food, clothing and all useful and beautiful things in great
    abundance.BUT THEY LABOUR IN VAIN--for they are mostly poor and often in
    want.Their women and
    children suffer, and their old age is branded with pauperism.Socialism is a plan by which poverty will be abolished, and
    everyone enabled to live in plenty and comfort, with leisure and
    opportunity for ampler life.If you wish to hear more of this plan, come to the field at the
    Cross Roads on the hill at Windley, on Tuesday evening next at 8
    P.M.and

                      LOOK OUT FOR THE SOCIALIST VAN

The cyclists rode away amid showers of stones without sustaining much
damage.One had his hand cut and another, who happened to look round,
was struck on the forehead, but these were the only casualties.On the following Tuesday evening, long before the appointed time, there
was a large crowd assembled at the cross roads or the hill at Windley,
waiting for the appearance of the van, and they were evidently prepared
to give the Socialists a warm reception.There was only one policeman
in uniform there but there were several in plain clothes amongst the
crowd.Crass, Dick Wantley, the Semi-drunk, Sawkins, Bill Bates and several
other frequenters of the Cricketers were amongst the crowd, and there
were also a sprinkling of tradespeople, including the Old Dear and Mr
Smallman, the grocer, and a few ladies and gentlemen--wealthy
visitors--but the bulk of the crowd were working men, labourers,
mechanics and boys.As it was quite evident that the crowd meant mischief--many of them had
their pockets filled with stones and were armed with sticks--several of
the Socialists were in favour of going to meet the van to endeavour to
persuade those in charge from coming, and with that object they
withdrew from the crowd, which was already regarding them with menacing
looks, and went down the road in the direction from which the van was
expected to come.They had not gone very far, however, before the
people, divining what they were going to do, began to follow them and
while they were hesitating what course to pursue, the Socialist van,
escorted by five or six men on bicycles, appeared round the corner at
the bottom of the hill.As soon as the crowd saw it, they gave an exultant cheer, or, rather,
yell, and began running down the hill to meet it, and in a few minutes
it was surrounded by a howling mob.The van was drawn by two horses;
there was a door and a small platform at the back and over this was a
sign with white letters on a red ground: 'Socialism, the only hope of
the Workers.'The driver pulled up, and another man on the platform at the rear
attempted to address the crowd, but his voice was inaudible in the din
of howls, catcalls, hooting and obscene curses.After about an hour of
this, as the crowd began pushing against the van and trying to overturn
it, the terrified horses commenced to get restive and uncontrollable,
and the man on the box attempted to drive up the hill.This seemed to
still further infuriate the horde of savages who surrounded the van.Numbers of them clutched the wheels and turned them the reverse way,
screaming that it must go back to where it came from; several of them
accordingly seized the horses' heads and, amid cheers, turned them
round.The man on the platform was still trying to make himself heard, but
without success.The strangers who had come with the van and the
little group of local Socialists, who had forced their way through the
crowd and gathered together close to the platform in front of the
would-be speaker, only increased the din by their shouts of appeal to
the crowd to 'give the man a fair chance'.This little bodyguard
closed round the van as it began to move slowly downhill, but they were
not sufficiently numerous to protect it from the crowd, which, not
being satisfied with the rate at which the van was proceeding, began to
shout to each other to 'Run it away!'and several
savage rushes were made with the intention of putting these suggestions
into execution.Some of the defenders were hampered with their bicycles, but they
resisted as well as they were able, and succeeded in keeping the crowd
off until the foot of the hill was reached, and then someone threw the
first stone, which by a strange chance happened to strike one of the
cyclists whose head was already bandaged--it was the same man who had
been hit on the Sunday.This stone was soon followed by others, and
the man on the platform was the next to be struck.He got it right on
the mouth, and as he put up his handkerchief to staunch the blood
another struck him on the forehead just above the temple, and he
dropped forward on his face on to the platform as if he had been shot.As the speed of the vehicle increased, a regular hail of stones fell
upon the roof and against the sides of the van and whizzed past the
retreating cyclists, while the crowd followed close behind, cheering,
shrieking out volleys of obscene curses, and howling like wolves.'We'll give the b--rs Socialism!'shouted Crass, who was literally
foaming at the mouth.'We'll teach 'em to come 'ere trying to undermined our bloody
morality,' howled Dick Wantley as he hurled a lump of granite that he
had torn up from the macadamized road at one of the cyclists.They ran on after the van until it was out of range, and then they
bethought themselves of the local Socialists; but they were nowhere to
be seen; they had prudently withdrawn as soon as the van had got fairly
under way, and the victory being complete, the upholders of the present
system returned to the piece of waste ground on the top of the hill,
where a gentleman in a silk hat and frockcoat stood up on a little
hillock and made a speech.He said nothing about the Distress
Committee or the Soup Kitchen or the children who went to school
without proper clothes or food, and made no reference to what was to be
done next winter, when nearly everybody would be out of work.These
were matters he and they were evidently not at all interested in.But
he said a good deal about the Glorious Empire!The things he said were received with rapturous
applause, and at the conclusion of his address, the crowd sang the
National Anthem with great enthusiasm and dispersed, congratulating
themselves that they had shown to the best of their ability what
Mugsborough thought of Socialism and the general opinion of the crowd
was that they would hear nothing more from the Socialist van.But in this they were mistaken, for the very next Sunday evening a
crowd of Socialists suddenly materialized at the Cross Roads.Some of
them had come by train, others had walked from different places and
some had cycled.A crowd gathered and the Socialists held a meeting, two speeches being
delivered before the crowd recovered from their surprise at the
temerity of these other Britishers who apparently had not sense enough
to understand that they had been finally defeated and obliterated last
Tuesday evening: and when the cyclist with the bandaged head got up on
the hillock some of the crowd actually joined in the hand-clapping with
which the Socialists greeted him.In the course of his speech he informed them that the man who had come
with the van and who had been felled whilst attempting to speak from
the platform was now in hospital.For some time it had been probable
that he would not recover, but he was now out of danger, and as soon as
he was well enough there was no doubt that he would come there again.Upon this Crass shouted out that if ever the Vanners did return, they
would finish what they had begun last Tuesday.He would not get off so
easy next time.But when he said this, Crass--not being able to see
into the future--did not know what the reader will learn in due time,
that the man was to return to that place under different circumstances.When they had finished their speech-making one of the strangers who was
acting as chairman invited the audience to put questions, but as nobody
wanted to ask any, he invited anyone who disagreed with what had been
said to get up on the hillock and state his objections, so that the
audience might have an opportunity of judging for themselves which side
was right; but this invitation was also neglected.Then the chairman
announced that they were coming there again next Sunday at the same
time, when a comrade would speak on 'Unemployment and Poverty, the
Cause and the Remedy', and then the strangers sang a song called
'England Arise', the first verse being:

        England Arise, the long, long night is over,
        Faint in the east, behold the Dawn appear
        Out of your evil dream of toil and sorrow
        Arise, O England!During the progress of the meeting several of the strangers had been
going out amongst the crowd giving away leaflets, which many of the
people gloomily refused to accept, and selling penny pamphlets, of
which they managed to dispose of about three dozen.Before declaring the meeting closed, the chairman said that the speaker
who was coming next week resided in London: he was not a millionaire,
but a workman, the same as nearly all those who were there present.They were not going to pay him anything for coming, but they intended
to pay his railway fare.Therefore next Sunday after the meeting there
would be a collection, and anything over the amount of the fare would
be used for the purchase of more leaflets such as those they were now
giving away.He hoped that anyone who thought that any of the money
went into the pockets of those who held the meeting would come and
join: then they could have their share.The meeting now terminated and the Socialists were suffered to depart
in peace.Some of them, however, lingered amongst the crowd after the
main body had departed, and for a long time after the meeting was over
little groups remained on the field excitedly discussing the speeches
or the leaflets.The next Sunday evening when the Socialists came they found the field
at the Cross Roads in the possession of a furious, hostile mob, who
refused to allow them to speak, and finally they had to go away without
having held a meeting.They came again the next Sunday, and on this
occasion they had a speaker with a very loud--literally a
stentorian--voice, and he succeeded in delivering an address, but as
only those who were very close were able to hear him, and as they were
all Socialists, it was not of much effect upon those for whom it was
intended.They came again the next Sunday and nearly every other Sunday during
the summer: sometimes they were permitted to hold their meeting in
comparative peace and at other times there was a row.They made
several converts, and many people declared themselves in favour of some
of the things advocated, but they were never able to form a branch of
their society there, because nearly all those who were convinced were
afraid to publicly declare themselves lest they should lose their
employment or customers.Chapter 44

The Beano


Now and then a transient gleam of sunshine penetrated the gloom in
which the lives of the philanthropists were passed.The cheerless
monotony was sometimes enlivened with a little innocent merriment.Every now and then there was a funeral which took Misery and Crass away
for the whole afternoon, and although they always tried to keep the
dates secret, the men generally knew when they were gone.Sometimes the people in whose houses they were working regaled them
with tea, bread and butter, cake or other light refreshments, and
occasionally even with beer--very different stuff from the petrifying
liquid they bought at the Cricketers for twopence a pint.At other
places, where the people of the house were not so generously disposed,
the servants made up for it, and entertained them in a similar manner
without the knowledge of their masters and mistresses.Even when the
mistresses were too cunning to permit of this, they were seldom able to
prevent the men from embracing the domestics, who for their part were
quite often willing to be embraced; it was an agreeable episode that
helped to vary the monotony of their lives, and there was no harm done.It was rather hard lines on the philanthropists sometimes when they
happened to be working in inhabited houses of the better sort.They
always had to go in and out by the back way, generally through the
kitchen, and the crackling and hissing of the poultry and the joints of
meat roasting in the ovens, and the odours of fruit pies and tarts, and
plum puddings and sage and onions, were simply maddening.In the
back-yards of these houses there were usually huge stacks of empty
beer, stout and wine bottles, and others that had contained whisky,
brandy or champagne.The smells of the delicious viands that were being prepared in the
kitchen often penetrated into the dismantled rooms that the
philanthropists were renovating, sometimes just as they were eating
their own wretched fare out of their dinner basket, and washing it down
with draughts of the cold tea or the petrifying liquid they sometimes
brought with them in bottles.Sometimes, as has been said, the people of the house used to send up
some tea and bread and butter or cakes or other refreshments to the
workmen, but whenever Hunter got to know of it being done he used to
speak to the people about it and request that it be discontinued, as it
caused the men to waste their time.But the event of the year was the Beano, which took place on the last
Saturday in August, after they had been paying in for about four
months.The cost of the outing was to be five shillings a head, so
this was the amount each man had to pay in, but it was expected that
the total cost--the hire of the brakes and the cost of the
dinner--would come out at a trifle less than the amount stated, and in
that case the surplus would be shared out after the dinner.The amount
of the share-out would be greater or less according to other
circumstances, for it generally happened that apart from the
subscriptions of the men, the Beano fund was swelled by charitable
donations from several quarters, as will be seen later on.When the eventful day arrived, the hands, instead of working till one,
were paid at twelve o'clock and rushed off home to have a wash and
change.The brakes were to start from the 'Cricketers' at one, but it was
arranged, for the convenience of those who lived at Windley, that they
were to be picked up at the Cross Roads at one-thirty.There were four brakes altogether--three large ones for the men and one
small one for the accommodation of Mr Rushton and a few of his personal
friends, Didlum, Grinder, Mr Toonarf, an architect and Mr Lettum, a
house and estate Agent.One of the drivers was accompanied by a friend
who carried a long coachman's horn.This gentleman was not paid to
come, but, being out of work, he thought that the men would be sure to
stand him a few drinks and that they would probably make a collection
for him in return for his services.Most of the chaps were smoking twopenny cigars, and had one or two
drinks with each other to try to cheer themselves up before they
started, but all the same it was a melancholy procession that wended
its way up the hill to Windley.To judge from the mournful expression
on the long face of Misery, who sat on the box beside the driver of the
first large brake, and the downcast appearance of the majority of the
men, one might have thought that it was a funeral rather than a
pleasure party, or that they were a contingent of lost souls being
conducted to the banks of the Styx.The man who from time to time
sounded the coachman's horn might have passed as the angel sounding the
last trump, and the fumes of the cigars were typical of the smoke of
their torment, which ascendeth up for ever and ever.A brief halt was made at the Cross Roads to pick up several of the men,
including Philpot, Harlow, Easton, Ned Dawson, Sawkins, Bill Bates and
the Semi-drunk.The two last-named were now working for Smeariton and
Leavit, but as they had been paying in from the first, they had elected
to go to the Beano rather than have their money back.The Semi-drunk
and one or two other habitual boozers were very shabby and down at
heel, but the majority of the men were decently dressed.Some had taken
their Sunday clothes out of pawn especially for the occasion.Others
were arrayed in new suits which they were going to pay for at the rate
of a shilling a week.Some had bought themselves second-hand suits,
one or two were wearing their working clothes brushed and cleaned up,
and some were wearing Sunday clothes that had not been taken out of
pawn for the simple reason that the pawnbrokers would not take them in.These garments were in what might be called a transition
stage--old-fashioned and shiny with wear, but yet too good to take for
working in, even if their owners had been in a position to buy some
others to take their place for best.Crass, Slyme and one or two of
the single men, however, were howling swells, sporting stand-up collars
and bowler hats of the latest type, in contradistinction to some of the
others, who were wearing hats of antique patterns, and collars of
various shapes with jagged edges.Harlow had on an old straw hat that
his wife had cleaned up with oxalic acid, and Easton had carefully dyed
the faded binding of his black bowler with ink.Their boots were the
worst part of their attire: without counting Rushton and his friends,
there were thirty-seven men altogether, including Nimrod, and there
were not half a dozen pairs of really good boots amongst the whole
crowd.When all were seated a fresh start was made.The small brake, with
Rushton, Didlum, Grinder and two or three other members of the Band,
led the way.Next came the largest brake with Misery on the box.Beside the driver of the third brake was Payne, the foreman carpenter.Crass occupied a similar position of honour on the fourth brake, on the
back step of which was perched the man with the coachman's horn.Crass--who had engaged the brakes--had arranged with the drivers that
the cortege should pass through the street where he and Easton lived,
and as they went by Mrs Crass was standing at the door with the two
young men lodgers, who waved their handkerchiefs and shouted greetings.A little further on Mrs Linden and Easton's wife were standing at the
door to see them go by.In fact, the notes of the coachman's horn
alarmed most of the inhabitants, who crowded to their windows and doors
to gaze upon the dismal procession as it passed.The mean streets of Windley were soon left far behind and they found
themselves journeying along a sunlit, winding road, bordered with
hedges of hawthorn, holly and briar, past rich, brown fields of
standing corn, shimmering with gleams of gold, past apple-orchards
where bending boughs were heavily loaded with mellow fruits exhaling
fragrant odours, through the cool shades of lofty avenues of venerable
oaks, whose overarched and interlacing branches formed a roof of green,
gilt and illuminated with quivering spots and shafts of sunlight that
filtered through the trembling leaves; over old mossy stone bridges,
spanning limpid streams that duplicated the blue sky and the fleecy
clouds; and then again, stretching away to the horizon on every side
over more fields, some rich with harvest, others filled with drowsing
cattle or with flocks of timid sheep that scampered away at the sound
of the passing carriages.Several times they saw merry little
companies of rabbits frisking gaily in and out of the hedges or in the
fields beside the sheep and cattle.At intervals, away in the
distance, nestling in the hollows or amid sheltering trees, groups of
farm buildings and stacks of hay; and further on, the square ivy-clad
tower of an ancient church, or perhaps a solitary windmill with its
revolving sails alternately flashing and darkening in the rays of the
sun.Past thatched wayside cottages whose inhabitants came out to wave
their hands in friendly greeting.Past groups of sunburnt,
golden-haired children who climbed on fences and five-barred gates, and
waved their hats and cheered, or ran behind the brakes for the pennies
the men threw down to them.From time to time the men in the brakes made half-hearted attempts at
singing, but it never came to much, because most of them were too
hungry and miserable.They had not had time to take any dinner and
would not have taken any even if they had the time, for they wished to
reserve their appetites for the banquet at the Queen Elizabeth, which
they expected to reach about half past three.However, they cheered up
a little after the first halt--at the Blue Lion, where most of them got
down and had a drink.Some of them, including the Semi-drunk, Ned
Dawson, Bill Bates and Joe Philpot--had two or three drinks, and felt
so much happier for them that, shortly after they started off again,
sounds of melody were heard from the brake the three first named rode
in--the one presided over by Crass--but it was not very successful, and
even after the second halt--about five miles further on--at the
Warrior's Head, they found it impossible to sing with any heartiness.Fitful bursts of song arose from time to time from each of the brakes
in turn, only to die mournfully away.It is not easy to sing on an
empty stomach even if one has got a little beer in it; and so it was
with most of them.They were not in a mood to sing, or to properly
appreciate the scenes through which they were passing.They wanted
their dinners, and that was the reason why this long ride, instead of
being a pleasure, became after a while, a weary journey that seemed as
if it were never coming to an end.The next stop was at the Bird in Hand, a wayside public house that
stood all by itself in a lonely hollow.The landlord was a fat,
jolly-looking man, and there were several customers in the bar--men who
looked like farm-labourers, but there were no other houses to be seen
anywhere.This extraordinary circumstance exercised the minds of our
travellers and formed the principal topic of conversation until they
arrived at the Dew Drop Inn, about half an hour afterwards.The first
brake, containing Rushton and his friends, passed on without stopping
here.The occupants of the second brake, which was only a little way
behind the first, were divided in opinion whether to stop or go on.Some shouted out to the driver to pull up, others ordered him to
proceed, and more were undecided which course to pursue--a state of
mind that was not shared by the coachman, who, knowing that if they
stopped somebody or other would be sure to stand him a drink, had no
difficulty whatever in coming to a decision, but drew rein at the inn,
an example that was followed by both the other carriages as they drove
up.It was a very brief halt, not more than half the men getting down at
all, and those who remained in the brakes grumbled so much at the delay
that the others drank their beer as quickly as possible and the journey
was resumed once more, almost in silence.No attempts at singing, no
noisy laughter; they scarcely spoke to each other, but sat gloomily
gazing out over the surrounding country.Instructions had been given to the drivers not to stop again till they
reached the Queen Elizabeth, and they therefore drove past the World
Turned Upside Down without stopping, much to the chagrin of the
landlord of that house, who stood at the door with a sickly smile upon
his face.Some of those who knew him shouted out that they would give
him a call on their way back, and with this he had to be content.They reached the long-desired Queen Elizabeth at twenty minutes to
four, and were immediately ushered into a large room where a round
table and two long ones were set for dinner--and they were set in a
manner worthy of the reputation of the house.The cloths that covered the tables and the serviettes, arranged fanwise
in the drinking glasses, were literally as white as snow, and about a
dozen knives and forks and spoons were laid for each person.Down the
centre of the table glasses of delicious yellow custard and cut-glass
dishes of glistening red and golden jelly alternated with vases of
sweet-smelling flowers.The floor of the dining-room was covered with oilcloth--red flowers on
a pale yellow ground; the pattern was worn off in places, but it was
all very clean and shining.Whether one looked at the walls with the
old-fashioned varnished oak paper, or at the glossy piano standing
across the corner near the white-curtained window, at the shining oak
chairs or through the open casement doors that led into the shady
garden beyond, the dominating impression one received was that
everything was exquisitely clean.The landlord announced that dinner would be served in ten minutes, and
while they were waiting some of them indulged in a drink at the
bar--just as an appetizer--whilst the others strolled in the garden or,
by the landlord's invitation, looked over the house.Amongst other
places, they glanced into the kitchen, where the landlady was
superintending the preparation of the feast, and in this place, with
its whitewashed walls and red-tiled floor, as in every other part of
the house, the same absolute cleanliness reigned supreme.'It's a bit differint from the Royal Caff, where we got the sack, ain't
it?'remarked the Semi-drunk to Bill Bates as they made their way to
the dining-room in response to the announcement that dinner was ready.Rushton, with Didlum and Grinder and his other friends, sat at the
round table near the piano.Hunter took the head of the longer of the
other two tables and Crass the foot, and on either side of Crass were
Bundy and Slyme, who had acted with him as the Committee who had
arranged the Beano.Payne, the foreman carpenter, occupied the head of
the other table.The dinner was all that could be desired; it was almost as good as the
kind of dinner that is enjoyed every day by those persons who are too
lazy to work but are cunning enough to make others work for them.There was soup, several entrees, roast beef, boiled mutton, roast
turkey, roast goose, ham, cabbage, peas, beans and sweets galore, plum
pudding, custard, jelly, fruit tarts, bread and cheese and as much beer
or lemonade as they liked to pay for, the drinks being an extra; and
afterwards the waiters brought in cups of coffee for those who desired
it.Everything was up to the knocker, and although they were somewhat
bewildered by the multitude of knives and forks, they all, with one or
two exceptions, rose to the occasion and enjoyed themselves famously.The excellent decorum observed being marred only by one or two
regrettable incidents.The first of these occurred almost as soon as
they sat down, when Ned Dawson who, although a big strong fellow, was
not able to stand much beer, not being used to it, was taken ill and
had to be escorted from the room by his mate Bundy and another man.They left him somewhere outside and he came back again about ten
minutes afterwards, much better but looking rather pale, and took his
seat with the others.The turkeys, the roast beef and the boiled mutton, the peas and beans
and the cabbage, disappeared with astonishing rapidity, which was not
to be wondered at, for they were all very hungry from the long drive,
and nearly everyone made a point of having at least one helping of
everything there was to be had.Some of them went in for two lots of
soup.Then for the next course, boiled mutton and ham or turkey: then
some roast beef and goose.Then a little more boiled mutton with a
little roast beef.Each of the three boys devoured several times his
own weight of everything, to say nothing of numerous bottles of
lemonade and champagne ginger beer.Crass frequently paused to mop the perspiration from his face and neck
with his serviette.There was
enough and to spare of everything to eat, the beer was of the best, and
all the time, amid the rattle of the crockery and the knives and forks,
the proceedings were enlivened by many jests and flashes of wit that
continuously kept the table in a roar.'Chuck us over another dollop of that there white stuff, Bob,' shouted
the Semi-drunk to Crass, indicating the blancmange.Crass reached out his hand and took hold of the dish containing the
'white stuff', but instead of passing it to the Semi-drunk, he
proceeded to demolish it himself, gobbling it up quickly directly from
the dish with a spoon.'Why, you're eating it all yerself, yer bleeder,' cried the Semi-drunk
indignantly, as soon as he realized what was happening.'That's all right, matey,' replied Crass affably as he deposited the
empty dish on the table.'It don't matter, there's plenty more where
it come from.Upon being applied to, the landlord, who was assisted by his daughter,
two other young women and two young men, brought in several more lots
and so the Semi-drunk was appeased.As for the plum-pudding--it was a fair knock-out; just like Christmas:
but as Ned Dawson and Bill Bates had drunk all the sauce before the
pudding was served, they all had to have their first helping without
any.However, as the landlord brought in another lot shortly
afterwards, that didn't matter either.As soon as dinner was over, Crass rose to make his statement as
secretary.Thirty-seven men had paid five shillings each: that made
nine pounds five shillings.The committee had decided that the three
boys--the painters' boy, the carpenters' boy and the front shop
boy--should be allowed to come half-price: that made it nine pounds
twelve and six.In addition to paying the ordinary five-shilling
subscription, Mr Rushton had given one pound ten towards the expenses.And several other gentlemen had also given something
towards it.Mr Sweater, of the Cave, one pound.Mr
Grinder, ten shillings in addition to the five-shilling subscription.Mr Lettum, ten shillings, as well as the five-shilling
subscription.Mr Didlum, ten shillings in addition to the
five shillings.Mr Toonarf, ten shillings as well as the
five-shilling subscription.They had also written to some of the
manufacturers who supplied the firm with materials, and asked them to
give something: some of 'em had sent half a crown, some five shillings,
some hadn't answered at all, and two of 'em had written back to say
that as things is cut so fine nowadays, they didn't hardly get no
profit on their stuff, so they couldn't afford to give nothing; but out
of all the firms they wrote to they managed to get thirty-two and
sixpence altogether, making a grand total of seventeen pounds.As for the expenses, the dinner was two and six a head, and there was
forty-five of them there, so that came to five pounds twelve and six.Then there was the hire of the brakes, also two and six a head, five
pound twelve and six, which left a surplus of five pound fifteen to be
shared out (applause), which came to three shillings each for the
thirty-seven men, and one and fourpence for each of the boys.Crass, Slyme and Bundy now walked round the tables distributing the
share-out, which was very welcome to everybody, especially those who
had spent nearly all their money during the journey from Mugsborough,
and when this ceremony was completed, Philpot moved a hearty vote of
thanks to the committee for the manner in which they had carried out
their duties, which was agreed to with acclamation.Then they made a
collection for the waiters, and the three waitresses, which amounted to
eleven shillings, for which the host returned thanks on behalf of the
recipients, who were all smiles.Then Mr Rushton requested the landlord to serve drinks and cigars all
round.Some had cigarettes and the teetotallers had lemonade or ginger
beer.Those who did not smoke themselves took the cigar all the same
and gave it to someone else who did.When all were supplied there
suddenly arose loud cries of 'Order!'and it was seen that Hunter was
upon his feet.As soon as silence was obtained, Misery said that he believed that
everyone there present would agree with him, when he said that they
should not let the occasion pass without drinking the 'ealth of their
esteemed and respected employer, Mr Rushton.Some of
them had worked for Mr Rushton on and off for many years, and as far as
THEY was concerned it was not necessary for him (Hunter) to say much in
praise of Mr Rushton.They knew Mr Rushton as well as
he did himself and to know him was to esteem him.As for the
new hands, although they did not know Mr Rushton as well as the old
hands did, he felt sure that they would agree that as no one could wish
for a better master.He had much pleasure in asking
them to drink Mr Rushton's health.'Musical honours, chaps,' shouted Crass, waving his glass and leading
off the singing which was immediately joined in with great enthusiasm
by most of the men, the Semi-drunk conducting the music with a table
knife:

        For he's a jolly good fellow,
        For he's a jolly good fellow,
        For he's a jolly good fel-ell-O,
        And so say all of us,
        So 'ip, 'ip, 'ip, 'ooray!So 'ip, 'ip, 'ip, 'ooray!For he's a jolly good fellow,
        For 'e's a jolly good fellow
        For 'e's a jolly good fel-ell-O,
        And so say all of us.Hip, hip, hip, hooray!Hip, hip, hip, hooray!Hip, hip, hip, hooray!Everyone present drank Rushton's health, or at any rate went through
the motions of doing so, but during the roar of cheering and singing
that preceded it several of the men stood with expressions of contempt
or uneasiness upon their faces, silently watching the enthusiasts or
looking at the ceiling or on the floor.'I will say this much,' remarked the Semidrunk as they all resumed
their seats--he had had several drinks during dinner, besides those he
had taken on the journey--I will say this much, although I did have a
little misunderstanding with Mr Hunter when I was workin' at the Royal
Caff, I must admit that this is the best firm that's ever worked under
me.'This statement caused a shout of laughter, which, however, died away as
Mr Rushton rose to acknowledge the toast to his health.He said that
he had now been in business for nearly sixteen years and this was--he
believed--the eleventh outing he had had the pleasure of attending.During all that time the business had steadily progressed and had
increased in volume from year to year, and he hoped and believed that
the progress made in the past would be continued in the future.Of course, he realized that the success of the business
depended very largely upon the men as well as upon himself; he did his
best in trying to get work for them, and it was necessary--if the
business was to go on and prosper--that they should also do their best
to get the work done when he had secured it for them.The masters could not do without the men, and the men could not live
without the masters.It was a matter of division of
labour: the men worked with their hands and the masters worked with
their brains, and one was no use without the other.He hoped the good
feeling which had hitherto existed between himself and his workmen
would always continue, and he thanked them for the way in which they
had responded to the toast of his health.Loud cheers greeted the conclusion of this speech, and then Crass stood
up and said that he begged to propose the health of Mr 'Unter.He wasn't going to make a long speech as he wasn't much of a
speaker.(Cries of 'You're all right,' 'Go on,' etc.)But he felt
sure as they would all hagree with him when he said that--next to Mr
Rushton--there wasn't no one the men had more respect and liking for
than Mr 'Unter.A few weeks ago when Mr 'Unter was laid up,
many of them began to be afraid as they was going to lose 'im.He was
sure that all the 'ands was glad to 'ave this hoppertunity of
congratulating him on his recovery (Hear, hear) and of wishing him the
best of 'ealth in the future and hoping as he would be spared to come
to a good many more Beanos.Loud applause greeted the conclusion of Crass's remarks, and once more
the meeting burst into song:

        For he's a jolly good fellow
        For he's a jolly good fellow.For he's a jolly good fellow,
        And so say all of us.So 'ip, 'ip, 'ip, 'ooray!So 'ip, 'ip, 'ip, 'ooray!When they had done cheering, Nimrod rose.His voice trembled a little
as he thanked them for their kindness, and said that he hoped he
deserved their goodwill.He could only say that as he was sure as he
always tried to be fair and considerate to everyone.He
would now request the landlord to replenish their glasses.As soon as the drinks were served, Nimrod again rose and said he wished
to propose the healths of their visitors who had so kindly contributed
to their expenses--Mr Lettum, Mr Didlum, Mr Toonarf and Mr Grinder.They were very pleased and proud to see them there (Hear,
hear), and he was sure the men would agree with him when he said that
Messrs Lettum, Didlum, Toonarf and Grinder were jolly good fellows.To judge from the manner in which they sang the chorus and cheered, it
was quite evident that most of the hands did agree.When they left
off, Grinder rose to reply on behalf of those included in the toast.He
said that it gave them much pleasure to be there and take part in such
pleasant proceedings and they were glad to think that they had been
able to help to bring it about.It was very gratifying to see the good
feeling that existed between Mr Rushton and his workmen, which was as
it should be, because masters and men was really fellow workers--the
masters did the brain work, the men the 'and work.They was both
workers, and their interests was the same.He liked to see men doing
their best for their master and knowing that their master was doing his
best for them, that he was not only a master, but a friend.That was
what he (Grinder) liked to see--master and men pulling together--doing
their best, and realizing that their interests was identical.If only all masters and men would do this they would find
that everything would go on all right, there would be more work and
less poverty.Let the men do their best for their masters, and the
masters do their best for their men, and they would find that that was
the true solution of the social problem, and not the silly nonsense
that was talked by people what went about with red flags.Most of those fellows were chaps who was too lazy to work
for their livin'.They could take it from him that, if
ever the Socialists got the upper hand there would just be a few of the
hartful dodgers who would get all the cream, and there would be nothing
left but 'ard work for the rest.That's wot hall those
hagitators was after: they wanted them (his hearers) to work and keep
'em in idleness.On behalf of Mr Didlum, Mr Toonarf, Mr
Lettum and himself, he thanked them for their good wishes, and hoped to
be with them on a sim'ler occasion in the future.Loud cheers greeted the termination of his speech, but it was obvious
from some of the men's faces that they resented Grinder's remarks.These men ridiculed Socialism and regularly voted for the continuance
of capitalism, and yet they were disgusted and angry with Grinder!There was also a small number of Socialists--not more than half a dozen
altogether--who did not join in the applause.These men were all
sitting at the end of the long table presided over by Payne.None of
them had joined in the applause that greeted the speeches, and so far
neither had they made any protest.Some of them turned very red as
they listened to the concluding sentences of Grinder's oration, and
others laughed, but none of them said anything.They knew before they
came that there was sure to be a lot of 'Jolly good fellow' business
and speechmaking, and they had agreed together beforehand to take no
part one way or the other, and to refrain from openly dissenting from
anything that might be said, but they had not anticipated anything
quite so strong as this.When Grinder sat down some of those who had applauded him began to jeer
at the Socialists.'What have you got to say to that?''They ain't got nothing to say now.''Why don't some of you get up and make a speech?'This last appeared to be a very good idea to those Liberals and Tories
who had not liked Grinder's observations, so they all began to shout
'Owen!'Several of those who had been loudest in applauding Grinder
also joined in the demand that Owen should make a speech, because they
were certain that Grinder and the other gentlemen would be able to
dispose of all his arguments; but Owen and the other Socialists made no
response except to laugh, so presently Crass tied a white handkerchief
on a cane walking-stick that belonged to Mr Didlum, and stuck it in the
vase of flowers that stood on the end of the table where the Socialist
group were sitting.When the noise had in some measure ceased, Grinder again rose.'When I
made the few remarks that I did, I didn't know as there was any
Socialists 'ere: I could tell from the look of you that most of you had
more sense.At the same time I'm rather glad I said what I did,
because it just shows you what sort of chaps these Socialists are.They're pretty artful--they know when to talk and when to keep their
mouths shut.What they like is to get hold of a few ignorant workin'
men in a workshop or a public house, and then they can talk by the
mile--reg'ler shop lawyers, you know wot I mean--I'm right and
everybody else is wrong.You know the sort of thing I
mean.When they finds theirselves in the company of edicated people
wot knows a little more than they does theirselves, and who isn't
likely to be misled by a lot of claptrap, why then, mum's the word.So
next time you hears any of these shop lawyers' arguments, you'll know
how much it's worth.'Most of the men were delighted with this speech, which was received
with much laughing and knocking on the tables.They remarked to each
other that Grinder was a smart man: he'd got the Socialists weighed up
just about right--to an ounce.Then, it was seen that Barrington was on his feet facing Grinder and a
sudden, awe-filled silence fell.'It may or may not be true,' began Barrington, 'that Socialists always
know when to speak and when to keep silent, but the present occasion
hardly seemed a suitable one to discuss such subjects.'We are here today as friends and want to forget our differences and
enjoy ourselves for a few hours.But after what Mr Grinder has said I
am quite ready to reply to him to the best of my ability.'The fact that I am a Socialist and that I am here today as one of Mr
Rushton's employees should be an answer to the charge that Socialists
are too lazy to work for their living.And as to taking advantage of
the ignorance and simplicity of working men and trying to mislead them
with nonsensical claptrap, it would have been more to the point if Mr
Grinder had taken some particular Socialist doctrine and had proved it
to be untrue or misleading, instead of adopting the cowardly method of
making vague general charges that he cannot substantiate.He would
find it far more difficult to do that than it would be for a Socialist
to show that most of what Mr Grinder himself has been telling us is
nonsensical claptrap of the most misleading kind.He tells us that the
employers work with their brains and the men with their hands.If it
is true that no brains are required to do manual labour, why put idiots
into imbecile asylums?Why not let them do some of the hand work for
which no brains are required?As they are idiots, they would probably
be willing to work for even less than the ideal "living wage".If Mr
Grinder had ever tried, he would know that manual workers have to
concentrate their minds and their attention on their work or they would
not be able to do it at all.His talk about employers being not only
the masters but the "friends" of their workmen is also mere claptrap
because he knows as well as we do, that no matter how good or
benevolent an employer may be, no matter how much he might desire to
give his men good conditions, it is impossible for him to do so,
because he has to compete against other employers who do not do that.It is the bad employer--the sweating, slave-driving employer--who sets
the pace and the others have to adopt the same methods--very often
against their inclinations--or they would not be able to compete with
him.If any employer today were to resolve to pay his workmen not less
wages than he would be able to live upon in comfort himself, that he
would not require them to do more work in a day than he himself would
like to perform every day of his own life, Mr Grinder knows as well as
we do that such an employer would be bankrupt in a month; because he
would not be able to get any work except by taking it at the same price
as the sweaters and the slave-drivers.'He also tells us that the interests of masters and men are identical;
but if an employer has a contract, it is to his interest to get the
work done as soon as possible; the sooner it is done the more profit he
will make; but the more quickly it is done, the sooner will the men be
out of employment.How then can it be true that their interests are
identical?'Again, let us suppose that an employer is, say, thirty years of age
when he commences business, and that he carries it on for twenty years.Let us assume that he employs forty men more or less regularly during
that period and that the average age of these men is also thirty years
at the time the employer commences business.At the end of the twenty
years it usually happens that the employer has made enough money to
enable him to live for the remainder of his life in ease and comfort.All through those twenty years they have
earned but a bare living wage and have had to endure such privations
that those who are not already dead are broken in health.'In the case of the employer there had been twenty years of steady
progress towards ease and leisure and independence.In the case of the
majority of the men there were twenty years of deterioration, twenty
years of steady, continuous and hopeless progress towards physical and
mental inefficiency: towards the scrap-heap, the work-house, and
premature death.What is it but false, misleading, nonsensical
claptrap to say that their interests were identical with those of their
employer?'Such talk as that is not likely to deceive any but children or fools.We are not children, but it is very evident that Mr Grinder thinks that
we are fools.'Occasionally it happens, through one or more of a hundred different
circumstances over which he has no control, or through some error of
judgement, that after many years of laborious mental work an employer
is overtaken by misfortune, and finds himself no better and even worse
off than when he started; but these are exceptional cases, and even if
he becomes absolutely bankrupt he is no worse off than the majority of
the workmen.'At the same time it is quite true that the real interests of employers
and workmen are the same, but not in the sense that Mr Grinder would
have us believe.Under the existing system of society but a very few
people, no matter how well off they may be, can be certain that they or
their children will not eventually come to want; and even those who
think they are secure themselves, find their happiness diminished by
the knowledge of the poverty and misery that surrounds them on every
side.'In that sense only is it true that the interests of masters and men
are identical, for it is to the interest of all, both rich and poor, to
help to destroy a system that inflicts suffering upon the many and
allows true happiness to none.It is to the interest of all to try and
find a better way.'Here Crass jumped up and interrupted, shouting out that they hadn't
come there to listen to a lot of speechmaking--a remark that was
greeted with unbounded applause by most of those present.Loud cries
of 'Hear, hear!'resounded through the room, and the Semi-drunk
suggested that someone should sing a song.The men who had clamoured for a speech from Owen said nothing, and Mr
Grinder, who had been feeling rather uncomfortable, was secretly very
glad of the interruption.The Semi-drunk's suggestion that someone should sing a song was
received with unqualified approbation by everybody, including
Barrington and the other Socialists, who desired nothing better than
that the time should be passed in a manner suitable to the occasion.The landlord's daughter, a rosy girl of about twenty years of age, in a
pink print dress, sat down at the piano, and the Semi-drunk, taking his
place at the side of the instrument and facing the audience, sang the
first song with appropriate gestures, the chorus being rendered
enthusiastically by the full strength of the company, including Misery,
who by this time was slightly drunk from drinking gin and ginger beer:

        'Come, come, come an' 'ave a drink with me
        Down by the ole Bull and Bush.Come, come, come an' shake 'ands with me
        Down by the ole Bull and Bush.Come an' take 'old of me 'and
        Come, come, come an' 'ave a drink with me,
        Down by the old Bull and Bush,
        Bush!Protracted knocking on the tables greeted the end of the song, but as
the Semi-drunk knew no other except odd verses and choruses, he called
upon Crass for the next, and that gentleman accordingly sang 'Work,
Boys, Work' to the tune of 'Tramp, tramp, tramp, the boys are
marching'.As this song is the Marseillaise of the Tariff Reform
Party, voicing as it does the highest ideals of the Tory workmen of
this country, it was an unqualified success, for most of them were
Conservatives.'Now I'm not a wealthy man,
        But I lives upon a plan
        Wot will render me as 'appy as a King;
        An' if you will allow, I'll sing it to you now,
        For time you know is always on the wing.Work, boys, work and be contented
        So long as you've enough to buy a meal.For if you will but try, you'll be wealthy--bye and bye--
        If you'll only put yer shoulder to the wheel.''Altogether, boys,' shouted Grinder, who was a strong Tariff Reformer,
and was delighted to see that most of the men were of the same way of
thinking; and the 'boys' roared out the chorus once more:

        Work, boys, work and be contented
        So long as you've enough to buy a meal
        For if you will but try, you'll be wealthy--bye and bye
        If you'll only put your shoulder to the wheel.As they sang the words of this noble chorus the Tories seemed to become
inspired with lofty enthusiasm.It is of course impossible to say for
certain, but probably as they sang there arose before their exalted
imaginations, a vision of the Past, and looking down the long vista of
the years that were gone, they saw that from their childhood they had
been years of poverty and joyless toil.They saw their fathers and
mothers, weaned and broken with privation and excessive labour, sinking
unhonoured into the welcome oblivion of the grave.And then, as a change came over the spirit of their dream, they saw the
Future, with their own children travelling along the same weary road to
the same kind of goal.It is possible that visions of this character were conjured up in their
minds by the singing, for the words of the song gave expression to
their ideal of what human life should be.That was all they wanted--to
be allowed to work like brutes for the benefit of other people.They
did not want to be civilized themselves and they intended to take good
care that the children they had brought into the world should never
enjoy the benefits of civilization either.As they often said:

'Who and what are our children that they shouldn't be made to work for
their betters?They're not Gentry's children, are they?The good
things of life was never meant for the likes of them.That's wot the likes of them was made for, and if we can only get
Tariff Reform for 'em they will always be sure of plenty of it--not
only Full Time, but Overtime!As for edication, travellin' in furrin'
parts, an' enjoying life an' all sich things as that, they was never
meant for the likes of our children--they're meant for Gentry's
children!Our children is only like so much dirt compared with
Gentry's children!That's wot the likes of us is made for--to Work for
Gentry, so as they can 'ave plenty of time to enjoy theirselves; and
the Gentry is made to 'ave a good time so as the likes of us can 'ave
Plenty of Work.'There were several more verses, and by the time they had sung them all,
the Tories were in a state of wild enthusiasm.Even Ned Dawson, who
had fallen asleep with his head pillowed on his arms on the table,
roused himself up at the end of each verse, and after having joined in
the chorus, went to sleep again.At the end of the song they gave three cheers for Tariff Reform and
Plenty of Work, and then Crass, who, as the singer of the last song,
had the right to call upon the next man, nominated Philpot, who
received an ovation when he stood up, for he was a general favourite.He never did no harm to nobody, and he was always wiling to do anyone a
good turn whenever he had the opportunity.Shouts of 'Good old Joe'
resounded through the room as he crossed over to the piano, and in
response to numerous requests for 'The old song' he began to sing 'The
Flower Show':

        'Whilst walkin' out the other night, not knowing where to go
        I saw a bill upon a wall about a Flower Show.So I thought the flowers I'd go and see to pass away the night.And when I got into that Show it was a curious sight.So with your kind intention and a little of your aid,
        Tonight some flowers I'll mention which I hope will never fade.'Omnes:
        To-night some flowers I'll mention which I hope will never fade.'There were several more verses, from which it appeared that the
principal flowers in the Show were the Rose, the Thistle and the
Shamrock.When he had finished, the applause was so deafening and the demands for
an encore so persistent that to satisfy them he sang another old
favourite--'Won't you buy my pretty flowers?''Ever coming, ever going,
        Men and women hurry by,
        Heedless of the tear-drops gleaming,
        In her sad and wistful eye
        How her little heart is sighing
        Thro' the cold and dreary hours,
        Only listen to her crying,
        "Won't you buy my pretty flowers?"'When the last verse of this sang had been sung five er six times,
Philpot exercised his right of nominating the next singer, and called
upon Dick Wantley, who with many suggestive gestures and grimaces sang
'Put me amongst the girls', and afterwards called upon Payne, the
foreman carpenter, who gave 'I'm the Marquis of Camberwell Green'.There was a lot of what music-hall artists call 'business' attached to
his song, and as he proceeded, Payne, who was ghastly pale and very
nervous, went through a lot of galvanic motions and gestures, bowing
and scraping and sliding about and flourishing his handkerchief in
imitation of the courtly graces of the Marquis.During this
performance the audience maintained an appalling silence, which so
embarrassed Payne that before he was half-way through the song he had
to stop because he could not remember the rest.However, to make up
for this failure he sang another called 'We all must die, like the fire
in the grate'.This also was received in a very lukewarm manner by the
crowd, same of whom laughed and others suggested that if he couldn't
sing any better than that, the sooner HE was dead the better.This was followed by another Tory ballad, the chorus being as follows:

        His clothes may be ragged, his hands may be soiled.But where's the disgrace if for bread he has toiled.His 'art is in the right place, deny it no one can
        The backbone of Old England is the honest workin' man.'After a few more songs it was decided to adjourn to a field at the rear
of the tavern to have a game of cricket.Sides were formed, Rushton,
Didlum, Grinder, and the other gentlemen taking part just as if they
were only common people, and while the game was in progress the rest
played ring quoits or reclined on the grass watching the players,
whilst the remainder amused themselves drinking beer and playing cards
and shove-ha'penny in the bar parlour, or taking walks around the
village sampling the beer at the other pubs, of which there were three.The time passed in this manner until seven o'clock, the hour at which
it had been arranged to start on the return journey; but about a
quarter of an hour before they set out an unpleasant incident occurred.During the time that they were playing cricket a party of glee singers,
consisting of four young girls and five men, three of whom were young
fellows, the other two being rather elderly, possibly the fathers of
some of the younger members of the party, came into the field and sang
several part songs for their entertainment.Towards the close of the
game most of the men had assembled in this field, and during a pause in
the singing the musicians sent one of their number, a shy girl about
eighteen years of age--who seemed as if she would rather that someone
else had the task--amongst the crowd to make a collection.The girl
was very nervous and blushed as she murmured her request, and held out
a straw hat that evidently belonged to one of the male members of the
glee party.A few of the men gave pennies, some refused or pretended
not to see either the girl or the hat, others offered to give her some
money for a kiss, but what caused the trouble was that two or three of
those who had been drinking more than was good for them dropped the
still burning ends of their cigars, all wet with saliva as they were,
into the hat and Dick Wantley spit into it.The girl hastily returned to her companions, and as she went some of
the men who had witnessed the behaviour of those who had insulted her,
advised them to make themselves scarce, as they stood a good chance of
getting a thrashing from the girl's friends.They said it would serve
them dam' well right if they did get a hammering.Partly sobered by fear, the three culprits sneaked off and hid
themselves, pale and trembling with terror, under the box seats of the
three brakes.They had scarcely left when the men of the glee party
came running up, furiously demanding to see those who had insulted the
girl.As they could get no satisfactory answer, one of their number
ran back and presently returned, bringing the girl with him, the other
young women following a little way behind.She said she could not see the men they were looking for, so they went
down to the public house to see if they could find them there, some of
the Rushton's men accompanying them and protesting their indignation.The time passed quickly enough and by half past seven the brakes were
loaded up again and a start made for the return journey.They called at all the taverns on the road, and by the time they
reached the Blue Lion half of them were three sheets in the wind, and
five or six were very drunk, including the driver of Crass's brake and
the man with the bugle.The latter was so far gone that they had to
let him lie down in the bottom of the carriage amongst their feet,
where he fell asleep, while the others amused themselves by blowing
weird shrieks out of the horn.There was an automatic penny-in-the-slot piano at the Blue Lion and as
that was the last house of the road they made a rather long stop there,
playing hooks and rings, shove-ha'penny, drinking, singing, dancing and
finally quarrelling.Several of them seemed disposed to quarrel with Newman.All sorts of
offensive remarks were made at him in his hearing.Once someone
ostentatiously knocked his glass of lemonade over, and a little later
someone else collided violently with him just as he was in the act of
drinking, causing his lemonade to spill all over his clothes.The
worst of it was that most of these rowdy ones were his fellow
passengers in Crass's brake, and there was not much chance of getting a
seat in either of the other carriages, for they were overcrowded
already.From the remarks he overheard from time to time, Newman guessed the
reason of their hostility, and as their manner towards him grew more
menacing, he became so nervous that he began to think of quietly
sneaking off and walking the remainder of the way home by himself,
unless he could get somebody in one of the other brakes to change seats
with him.Whilst these thoughts were agitating his mind, Dick Wantley suddenly
shouted out that he was going to go for the dirty tyke who had offered
to work under price last winter.It was his fault that they were all working for sixpence halfpenny and
he was going to wipe the floor with him.Some of his friends eagerly
offered to assist, but others interposed, and for a time it looked as
if there was going to be a free fight, the aggressors struggling hard
to get at their inoffensive victim.Eventually, however, Newman found a seat in Misery's brake, squatting
on the floor with his back to the horses, thankful enough to be out of
reach of the drunken savages, who were now roaring out ribald songs and
startling the countryside, as they drove along, with unearthly blasts
on the coach horn.Meantime, although none of them seemed to notice it, the brake was
travelling at a furious rate, and swaying about from side to side in a
very erratic manner.It would have been the last carriage, but things
had got a bit mixed at the Blue Lion and, instead of bringing up the
rear of the procession, it was now second, just behind the small
vehicle containing Rushton and his friends.Crass several times reminded them that the other carriage was so near
that Rushton must be able to hear every word that was said, and these
repeated admonitions at length enraged the Semi-drunk, who shouted out
that they didn't care a b--r if he could hear.'You're only a dirty toe-rag!That's all you are--a bloody rotter!That's the only reason you gets put in charge of jobs--'cos you're a
good <DW65>-driver!You're a bloody sight worse than Rushton or Misery
either!Who was it started the one-man, one-room dodge, eh?'Knock 'im orf 'is bleedin' perch,' suggested Bundy.Everybody seemed to think this was a very good idea, but when the
Semi-drunk attempted to rise for the purpose of carrying it out, he was
thrown down by a sudden lurch of the carriage on the top of the
prostrate figure of the bugle man and by the time the others had
assisted him back to his seat they had forgotten all about their plan
of getting rid of Crass.Meantime the speed of the vehicle had increased to a fearful rate.Rushton and the other occupants of the little wagonette in front had
been for some time shouting to them to moderate the pace of their
horses, but as the driver of Crass's brake was too drunk to understand
what they said he took no notice, and they had no alternative but to
increase their own speed to avoid being run down.The drunken driver
now began to imagine that they were trying to race him, and became
fired with the determination to pass them.It was a very narrow road,
but there was just about room to do it, and he had sufficient
confidence in his own skill with the ribbons to believe that he could
get past in safety.The terrified gesticulations and the shouts of Rushton's party only
served to infuriate him, because he imagined that they were jeering at
him for not being able to overtake them.He stood up on the footboard
and lashed the horses till they almost flew over the ground, while the
carriage swayed and skidded in a fearful manner.In front, the horses of Rushton's conveyance were also galloping at top
speed, the vehicle bounding and reeling from one side of the road to
the other, whilst its terrified occupants, whose faces were blanched
with apprehension, sat clinging to their seats and to each other, their
eyes projecting from the sockets as they gazed back with terror at
their pursuers, some of whom were encouraging the drunken driver with
promises of quarts of beer, and urging on the horses with curses and
yells.Crass's fat face was pallid with fear as he clung trembling to his
seat.Another man, very drunk and oblivious of everything, was leaning
over the side of the brake, spewing into the road, while the remainder,
taking no interest in the race, amused themselves by singing--conducted
by the Semi-drunk--as loud as they could roar:

        'Has anyone seen a Germin band,
        Germin Band, Germin Band?I've been lookin' about,
        Pom--Pom, Pom, Pom, Pom!'I've searched every pub, both near and far,
        Near and far, near and far,
        I want my Fritz,
        What plays tiddley bits
        On the big trombone!'The one presided over by
Hunter contained a mournful crew.Nimrod himself, from the effects of
numerous drinks of ginger beer with secret dashes of gin in it, had
become at length crying drunk, and sat weeping in gloomy silence beside
the driver, a picture of lachrymose misery and but dimly conscious of
his surroundings, and Slyme, who rode with Hunter because he was a
fellow member of the Shining Light Chapel.Then there was another
paperhanger--an unhappy wretch who was afflicted with religious mania;
he had brought a lot of tracts with him which he had distributed to the
other men, to the villagers of Tubberton and to anybody else who would
take them.Most of the other men who rode in Nimrod's brake were of the
'religious' working man type.Ignorant, shallow-pated dolts, without
as much intellectuality as an average cat.Attendants at various PSAs
and 'Church Mission Halls' who went every Sunday afternoon to be
lectured on their duty to their betters and to have their minds--save
the mark!--addled and stultified by such persons as Rushton, Sweater,
Didlum and Grinder, not to mention such mental specialists as the holy
reverend Belchers and Boshers, and such persons as John Starr.At these meetings none of the'respectable' working men were allowed to
ask any questions, or to object to, or find fault with anything that
was said, or to argue, or discuss, or criticize.They had to sit there
like a lot of children while they were lectured and preached at and
patronized.Even as sheep before their shearers are dumb, so they were
not permitted to open their mouths.For that matter they did not wish
to be allowed to ask any questions, or to discuss anything.They sat there and listened to what was said,
but they had but a very hazy conception of what it was all about.Most of them belonged to these PSAs merely for the sake of the loaves
and fishes.Every now and then they were awarded prizes--Self-help by
Smiles, and other books suitable for perusal by persons suffering from
almost complete obliteration of the mental faculties.Besides other
benefits there was usually a Christmas Club attached to the 'PSA' or
'Mission' and the things were sold to the members slightly below cost
as a reward for their servility.They were for the most part tame, broken-spirited, poor wretches who
contentedly resigned themselves to a life of miserable toil and
poverty, and with callous indifference abandoned their offspring to the
same fate.Compared with such as these, the savages of New Guinea or
the Red Indians are immensely higher in the scale of manhood.They call no man master; and if they do not enjoy the benefits
of science and civilization, neither do they toil to create those
things for the benefit of others.And as for their children--most of
those savages would rather knock them on the head with a tomahawk than
allow them to grow up to be half-starved drudges for other men.But these were not free: their servile lives were spent in grovelling
and cringing and toiling and running about like little dogs at the
behest of their numerous masters.And as for the benefits of science
and civilization, their only share was to work and help to make them,
and then to watch other men enjoy them.And all the time they were
tame and quiet and content and said, 'The likes of us can't expect to
'ave nothing better, and as for our children wot's been good enough for
us is good enough for the likes of them.'But although they were so religious and respectable and so contented to
be robbed on a large scale, yet in small matters, in the commonplace
and petty affairs of their everyday existence, most of these men were
acutely alive to what their enfeebled minds conceived to be their own
selfish interests, and they possessed a large share of that singular
cunning which characterizes this form of dementia.That was why they had chosen to ride in Nimrod's brake--because they
wished to chum up with him as much as possible, in order to increase
their chances of being kept on in preference to others who were not so
respectable.Some of these poor creatures had very large heads, but a close
examination would have shown that the size was due to the extraordinary
thickness of the bones.The cavity of the skull was not so large as
the outward appearance of the head would have led a casual observer to
suppose, and even in those instances where the brain was of a fair
size, it was of inferior quality, being coarse in texture and to a
great extent composed of fat.Although most of them were regular attendants at some place of
so-called worship, they were not all teetotallers, and some of them
were now in different stages of intoxication, not because they had had
a great deal to drink, but because--being usually abstemious--it did
not take very much to make them drunk.From time to time this miserable crew tried to enliven the journey by
singing, but as most of them only knew odd choruses it did not come to
much.As for the few who did happen to know all the words of a song,
they either had no voices or were not inclined to sing.The most
successful contribution was that of the religious maniac, who sang
several hymns, the choruses being joined in by everybody, both drunk
and sober.The strains of these hymns, wafted back through the balmy air to the
last coach, were the cause of much hilarity to its occupants who also
sang the choruses.As they had all been brought up under 'Christian'
influences and educated in 'Christian' schools, they all knew the
words: 'Work, for the night is coming', 'Turn poor Sinner and escape
Eternal Fire', 'Pull for the Shore' and 'Where is my Wandering Boy?'The last reminded Harlow of a song he knew nearly all the words of,
'Take the news to Mother', the singing of which was much appreciated by
all present and when it was finished they sang it all over again,
Philpot being so affected that he actually shed tears; and Easton
confided to Owen that there was no getting away from the fact that a
boy's best friend is his mother.In this last carriage, as in the other two, there were several men who
were more or less intoxicated and for the same reason--because not
being used to taking much liquor, the few extra glasses they had drunk
had got into their heads.They were as sober a lot of fellows as need
be at ordinary times, and they had flocked together in this brake
because they were all of about the same character--not tame, contented
imbeciles like most of those in Misery's carnage, but men something
like Harlow, who, although dissatisfied with their condition, doggedly
continued the hopeless, weary struggle against their fate.They were not teetotallers and they never went to either church or
chapel, but they spent little in drink or on any form of enjoyment--an
occasional glass of beer or a still rarer visit to a music-hall and now
and then an outing more or less similar to this being the sum total of
their pleasures.These four brakes might fitly be regarded as so many travelling lunatic
asylums, the inmates of each exhibiting different degrees and forms of
mental disorder.The occupants of the first--Rushton, Didlum and Co.--might be classed
as criminal lunatics who injured others as well as themselves.In a
properly constituted system of society such men as these would be
regarded as a danger to the community, and would be placed under such
restraint as would effectually prevent them from harming themselves or
others.These wretches had abandoned every thought and thing that
tends to the elevation of humanity.They had given up everything that
makes life good and beautiful, in order to carry on a mad struggle to
acquire money which they would never be sufficiently cultured to
properly enjoy.Deaf and blind to every other consideration, to this
end they had degraded their intellects by concentrating them upon the
minutest details of expense and profit, and for their reward they raked
in their harvest of muck and lucre along with the hatred and curses of
those they injured in the process.They knew that the money they
accumulated was foul with the sweat of their brother men, and wet with
the tears of little children, but they were deaf and blind and callous
to the consequences of their greed.Devoid of every ennobling thought
or aspiration, they grovelled on the filthy ground, tearing up the
flowers to get at the worms.In the coach presided over by Crass, Bill Bates, the Semi-drunk and the
other two or three habitual boozers were all men who had been driven
mad by their environment.At one time most of them had been fellows
like Harlow, working early and late whenever they got the chance, only
to see their earnings swallowed up in a few minutes every Saturday by
the landlord and all the other host of harpies and profitmongers, who
were waiting to demand it as soon as it was earned.In the years that
were gone, most of these men used to take all their money home
religiously every Saturday and give it to the 'old girl' for the house,
and then, lo and behold, in a moment, yea, even in the twinkling of an
eye, it was all gone!and nothing to
show for it except an insufficiency of the bare necessaries of life!But after a time they had become heartbroken and sick and tired of that
sort of thing.They hankered after a little pleasure, a little
excitement, a little fun, and they found that it was possible to buy
something like those in quart pots at the pub.They knew they were not
the genuine articles, but they were better than nothing at all, and so
they gave up the practice of giving all their money to the old girl to
give to the landlord and the other harpies, and bought beer with some
of it instead; and after a time their minds became so disordered from
drinking so much of this beer, that they cared nothing whether the rent
was paid or not.They cared but little whether the old girl and the
children had food or clothes.They said, 'To hell with everything and
everyone,' and they cared for nothing so long as they could get plenty
of beer.The occupants of Nimrod's coach have already been described and most of
them may correctly be classed as being similar to <DW35> idiots of the
third degree--very cunning and selfish, and able to read and write, but
with very little understanding of what they read except on the most
common topics.As for those who rode with Harlow in the last coach, most of them, as
has been already intimated, were men of similar character to himself.The greater number of them fairly good workmen and--unlike the boozers
in Crass's coach--not yet quite heartbroken, but still continuing the
hopeless struggle against poverty.These differed from Nimrod's lot
inasmuch as they were not content.They were always complaining of
their wretched circumstances, and found a certain kind of pleasure in
listening to the tirades of the Socialists against the existing social
conditions, and professing their concurrence with many of the
sentiments expressed, and a desire to bring about a better state of
affairs.Most of them appeared to be quite sane, being able to converse
intelligently on any ordinary subject without discovering any symptoms
of mental disorder, and it was not until the topic of Parliamentary
elections was mentioned that evidence of their insanity was
forthcoming.It then almost invariably appeared that they were subject
to the most extraordinary hallucinations and extravagant delusions, the
commonest being that the best thing that the working people could do to
bring about an improvement in their condition, was to continue to elect
their Liberal and Tory employers to make laws for and to rule over
them!At such times, if anyone ventured to point out to them that that
was what they had been doing all their lives, and referred them to the
manifold evidences that met them wherever they turned their eyes of its
folly and futility, they were generally immediately seized with a
paroxysm of the most furious mania, and were with difficulty prevented
from savagely assaulting those who differed from them.They were usually found in a similar condition of maniacal excitement
for some time preceding and during a Parliamentary election, but
afterwards they usually manifested that modification of insanity which
is called melancholia.In fact they alternated between these two forms
of the disease.During elections, the highest state of exalted mania;
and at ordinary times--presumably as a result of reading about the
proceedings in Parliament of the persons whom they had elected--in a
state of melancholic depression, in their case an instance of hope
deferred making the heart sick.This condition occasionally proved to be the stage of transition into
yet another modification of the disease--that known as dipsomania, the
phase exhibited by Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk.Yet another form of insanity was that shown by the Socialists.Like
most of their fellow passengers in the last coach, the majority of
these individuals appeared to be of perfectly sound mind.Upon
entering into conversation with them one found that they reasoned
correctly and even brilliantly.They had divided their favourite
subject into three parts.First; an exact definition of the condition
known as Poverty.Secondly; a knowledge of the causes of Poverty; and
thirdly, a rational plan for the cure of Poverty.Those who were
opposed to them always failed to refute their arguments, and feared,
and nearly always refused, to meet them in fair fight--in open
debate--preferring to use the cowardly and despicable weapons of
slander and misrepresentation.The fact that these Socialists never
encountered their opponents except to defeat them, was a powerful
testimony to the accuracy of their reasonings and the correctness of
their conclusions--and yet they were undoubtedly mad.One might
converse with them for an indefinite time on the three divisions of
their subject without eliciting any proofs of insanity, but directly
one inquired what means they proposed to employ in order to bring about
the adoption of their plan, they replied that they hoped to do so by
reasoning with the others!Although they had sense enough to understand the real causes of
poverty, and the only cure for poverty, they were nevertheless so
foolish that they entertained the delusion that it is possible to
reason with demented persons, whereas every sane person knows that to
reason with a maniac is not only fruitless, but rather tends to fix
more deeply the erroneous impressions of his disordered mind.The wagonette containing Rushton and his friends continued to fly over
the road, pursued by the one in which rode Crass, Bill Bates, and the
Semi-drunk; but notwithstanding all the efforts of the drunken driver,
they were unable to overtake or pass the smaller vehicle, and when they
reached the foot of the hill that led up to Windley the distance
between the two carriages rapidly increased, and the race was
reluctantly abandoned.When they reached the top of the hill Rushton and his friends did not
wait for the others, but drove off towards Mugsborough as fast as they
could.Crass's brake was the next to arrive at the summit, and they halted
there to wait for the other two conveyances and when they came up all
those who lived nearby got out, and some of them sang 'God Save the
King', and then with shouts of 'Good Night', and cries of 'Don't forget
six o'clock Monday morning', they dispersed to their homes and the
carriages moved off once more.At intervals as they passed through Windley brief stoppages were made
in order to enable others to get out, and by the time they reached the
top of the long incline that led down into Mugsborough it was nearly
twelve o'clock and the brakes were almost empty, the only passengers
being Owen and four or five others who lived down town.By ones and
twos these also departed, disappearing into the obscurity of the night,
until there was none left, and the Beano was an event of the past.Chapter 45

The Great Oration


The outlook for the approaching winter was--as usual--gloomy in the
extreme.One of the leading daily newspapers published an article
prophesying a period of severe industrial depression.'As the
warehouses were glutted with the things produced by the working
classes, there was no need for them to do any more work--at present;
and so they would now have to go and starve until such time as their
masters had sold or consumed the things already produced.'Of course,
the writer of the article did not put it exactly like that, but that
was what it amounted to.This article was quoted by nearly all the
other papers, both Liberal and Conservative.The Tory papers--ignoring
the fact that all the Protectionist countries were in exactly the same
condition, published yards of misleading articles about Tariff Reform.The Liberal papers said Tariff Reform was no remedy.Look at America
and Germany--worse than here!Still, the situation was undoubtedly
very serious--continued the Liberal papers--and Something would have to
be done.They did not say exactly what, because, of course, they did
not know; but Something would have to be done--tomorrow.They talked
vaguely about Re-afforestation, and Reclaiming of Foreshores, and Sea
walls: but of course there was the question of Cost!But all the same Something would have to be done.Great caution was necessary in dealing with
such difficult problems!We must go slow, and if in the meantime a few
thousand children die of starvation, or become 'rickety' or consumptive
through lack of proper nutrition it is, of course, very regrettable,
but after all they are only working-class children, so it doesn't
matter a great deal.Most of the writers of these Liberal and Tory papers seemed to think
that all that was necessary was to find 'Work' for the 'working' class!That was their conception of a civilized nation in the twentieth
century!For the majority of the people to work like brutes in order
to obtain a 'living wage' for themselves and to create luxuries for a
small minority of persons who are too lazy to work at all!And
although this was all they thought was necessary, they did not know
what to do in order to bring even that much to pass!Winter was
returning, bringing in its train the usual crop of horrors, and the
Liberal and Tory monopolists of wisdom did not know what to do!Rushton's had so little work in that nearly all the hands expected that
they would be slaughtered the next Saturday after the 'Beano' and there
was one man--Jim Smith he was called--who was not allowed to live even
till then: he got the sack before breakfast on the Monday morning after
the Beano.This man was about forty-five years old, but very short for his age,
being only a little over five feet in height.The other men used to
say that Little Jim was not made right, for while his body was big
enough for a six-footer, his legs were very short, and the fact that he
was rather inclined to be fat added to the oddity of his appearance.On the Monday morning after the Beano he was painting an upper room in
a house where several other men were working, and it was customary for
the coddy to shout 'Yo!at mealtimes, to let the hands know when
it was time to leave off work.At about ten minutes to eight, Jim had
squared the part of the work he had been doing--the window--so he
decided not to start on the door or the skirting until after breakfast.Whilst he was waiting for the foreman to shout 'Yo!his mind
reverted to the Beano, and he began to hum the tunes of some of the
songs that had been sung.He hummed the tune of 'He's a jolly good
fellow', and he could not get the tune out of his mind: it kept buzzing
in his head.It could not be very far
off eight now, to judge by the amount of work he had done since six
o'clock.He had rubbed down and stopped all the woodwork and painted
the window.He was only getting
sixpence-halfpenny an hour and if he hadn't earned a bob he hadn't
earned nothing!Anyhow, whether he had done enough for 'em or not he
wasn't goin' to do no more before breakfast.The tune of 'He's a jolly good fellow' was still buzzing in his head;
he thrust his hands deep down in his trouser pockets, and began to
polka round the room, humming softly:

        'I won't do no more before breakfast!So 'ip 'ip 'ip 'ooray!So 'ip 'ip 'ip 'ooray So 'ip 'ip 'ooray!I won't do no more before breakfast--etc.'and you won't do but very little after breakfast, here!'shouted
Hunter, suddenly entering the room.'I've bin watchin' of you through the crack of the door for the last
'arf hour; and you've not done a dam' stroke all the time.You make
out yer time sheet, and go to the office at nine o'clock and git yer
money; we can't afford to pay you for playing the fool.'Leaving the man dumbfounded and without waiting for a reply, Misery
went downstairs and after kicking up a devil of a row with the foreman
for the lack of discipline on the job, he instructed him that Smith was
not to be permitted to resume work after breakfast.He had come in so stealthily that no one had known anything of his
arrival until they heard him bellowing at Smith.The latter did not stay to take breakfast but went off at once, and
when he was gone the other chaps said it served him bloody well right:
he was always singing, he ought to have more sense.You can't do as
you like nowadays you know!Easton--who was working at another job with Crass as his foreman--knew
that unless some more work came in he was likely to be one of those who
would have to go.As far as he could see it was only a week or two at
the most before everything would be finished up.But notwithstanding
the prospect of being out of work so soon he was far happier than he
had been for several months past, for he imagined he had discovered the
cause of Ruth's strange manner.This knowledge came to him on the night of the Beano.When he arrived
home he found that Ruth had already gone to bed: she had not been well,
and it was Mrs Linden's explanation of her illness that led Easton to
think that he had discovered the cause of the unhappiness of the last
few months.Now that he knew--as he thought--he blamed himself for not
having been more considerate and patient with her.At the same time he
was at a loss to understand why she had not told him about it herself.The only explanation he could think of was the one suggested by Mrs
Linden--that at such times women often behaved strangely.However that
might be, he was glad to think he knew the reason of it all, and he
resolved that he would be more gentle and forebearing with her.The place where he was working was practically finished.It was a
large house called 'The Refuge', very similar to 'The Cave', and during
the last week or two, it had become what they called a 'hospital'.That is, as the other jobs became finished the men were nearly all sent
to this one, so that there was quite a large crowd of them there.The
inside work was all finished--with the exception of the kitchen, which
was used as a mess room, and the scullery, which was the paint shop.Poor old Joe Philpot, whose
rheumatism had been very bad lately, was doing a very rough
job--painting the gable from a long ladder.But though there were plenty of younger men more suitable for this,
Philpot did not care to complain for fear Crass or Misery should think
he was not up to his work.At dinner time all the old hands assembled
in the kitchen, including Crass, Easton, Harlow, Bundy and Dick
Wantley, who still sat on a pail behind his usual moat.Philpot and Harlow were absent and everybody wondered what had become
of them.Several times during the morning they had been seen whispering together
and comparing scraps of paper, and various theories were put forward to
account for their disappearance.Most of the men thought they must
have heard something good about the probable winner of the Handicap and
had gone to put something on.Some others thought that perhaps they
had heard of another 'job' about to be started by some other firm and
had gone to inquire about it.'Looks to me as if they'll stand a very good chance of gettin' drowned
if they're gone very far,' remarked Easton, referring to the weather.It had been threatening to rain all the morning, and during the last
few minutes it had become so dark that Crass lit the gas, so that--as
he expressed it--they should be able to see the way to their mouths.Outside, the wind grew more boisterous every moment; the darkness
continued to increase, and presently there succeeded a torrential
downfall of rain, which beat fiercely against the windows, and poured
in torrents down the glass.No
more work could be done outside that day, and there was nothing left to
do inside.As they were paid by the hour, this would mean that they
would have to lose half a day's pay.'If it keeps on like this we won't be able to do no more work, and we
won't be able to go home either,' remarked Easton.'Well, we're all right 'ere, ain't we?'said the man behind the moat;
'there's a nice fire and plenty of heasy chairs.Wot the 'ell more do
you want?''If we only had a shove-ha'penny
table or a ring board, I reckon we should be able to enjoy ourselves
all right.'Philpot and Harlow were still absent, and the others again fell to
wondering where they could be.'I see old Joe up on 'is ladder only a few minutes before twelve,'
remarked Wantley.At this moment the two truants returned, looking very important.Philpot was armed with a hammer and carried a pair of steps, while
Harlow bore a large piece of wallpaper which the two of them proceeded
to tack on the wall, much to the amusement of the others, who read the
announcement opposite written in charcoal.Every day at meals since Barrington's unexpected outburst at the Beano
dinner, the men had been trying their best to 'kid him on' to make
another speech, but so far without success.If anything, he had been
even more silent and reserved than before, as if he felt some regret
that he had spoken as he had on that occasion.Crass and his disciples
attributed Barrington's manner to fear that he was going to get the
sack for his trouble and they agreed amongst themselves that it would
serve him bloody well right if 'e did get the push.When they had fixed the poster on the wall, Philpot stood the steps in
the corner of the room, with the back part facing outwards, and then,
everything being ready for the lecturer, the two sat down in their
accustomed places and began to eat their dinners, Harlow remarking that
they would have to buck up or they would be too late for the meeting;
and the rest of the crowd began to discuss the poster.'Wot the 'ell does PLO mean?''Plain Layer On,' answered Philpot modestly.''Ave you ever 'eard the Professor preach before?'inquired the man on
the pail, addressing Bundy.Imperial Bankquet Hall

'Only once, at the Beano,' replied that individual; 'an' that was once
too often!''Finest speaker I ever 'eard,' said the man on the pail with
enthusiasm.'I wouldn't miss this lecture for anything: this is one of
'is best subjects.I got 'ere about two hours before the doors was
opened, so as to be sure to get a seat.''Yes, it's a very good subject,' said Crass, with a sneer.'I believe
most of the Labour Members in Parliament is well up in it.''Seems to me as
if most of them knows something about it too.''The difference is,' said Owen, 'the working classes voluntarily pay to
keep the Labour Members, but whether they like it or not, they have to
keep the others.''The Labour members is sent to the 'Ouse of Commons,' said Harlow, 'and
paid their wages to do certain work for the benefit of the working
classes, just the same as we're sent 'ere and paid our wages by the
Bloke to paint this 'ouse.''Yes,' said Crass; 'but if we didn't do the work we're paid to do, we
should bloody soon get the sack.''I can't see how we've got to keep the other members,' said Slyme;
'they're mostly rich men, and they live on their own money.''And I should like to know where we should be
without 'em!It seems to me more like it
that they keeps us!Where
should we be if it wasn't for all the money they spend and the work
they 'as done?If the owner of this 'ouse 'adn't 'ad the money to
spend to 'ave it done up, most of us would 'ave bin out of work this
last six weeks, and starvin', the same as lots of others 'as been.''Oh yes, that's right enough,' agreed Bundy.Before any work can be done there's one thing
necessary, and that's money.It would be easy to find work for all the
unemployed if the local authorities could only raise the money.''Yes; that's quite true,' said Owen.'And that proves that money is
the cause of poverty, because poverty consists in being short of the
necessaries of life: the necessaries of life are all produced by labour
applied to the raw materials: the raw materials exist in abundance and
there are plenty of people able and willing to work; but under present
conditions no work can be done without money; and so we have the
spectacle of a great army of people compelled to stand idle and starve
by the side of the raw materials from which their labour could produce
abundance of all the things they need--they are rendered helpless by
the power of Money!Those who possess all the money say that the
necessaries of life shall not be produced except for their profit.'and you can't alter it,' said Crass, triumphantly.'It's always
been like it, and it always will be like it.''There's always been
rich and poor in the world, and there always will be.'Several others expressed their enthusiastic agreement with Crass's
opinion, and most of them appeared to be highly delighted to think that
the existing state of affairs could never be altered.'It hasn't always been like it, and it won't always be like it,' said
Owen.'The time will come, and it's not very far distant, when the
necessaries of life will be produced for use and not for profit.The
time is coming when it will no longer be possible for a few selfish
people to condemn thousands of men and women and little children to
live in misery and die of want.''Ah well, it won't be in your time, or mine either,' said Crass
gleefully, and most of the others laughed with imbecile satisfaction.'I've 'eard a 'ell of a lot about this 'ere Socialism,' remarked the
man behind the moat, 'but up to now I've never met nobody wot could
tell you plainly exactly wot it is.''Yes; that's what I should like to know too,' said Easton.'Socialism means, "What's yours is mine, and what's mine's me own,"'
observed Bundy, and during the laughter that greeted this definition
Slyme was heard to say that Socialism meant Materialism, Atheism and
Free Love, and if it were ever to come about it would degrade men and
women to the level of brute beasts.Harlow said Socialism was a
beautiful ideal, which he for one would be very glad to see realized,
and he was afraid it was altogether too good to be practical, because
human nature is too mean and selfish.Sawkins said that Socialism was
a lot of bloody rot, and Crass expressed the opinion--which he had
culled from the delectable columns of the Obscurer--that it meant
robbing the industrious for the benefit of the idle and thriftless.Philpot had by this time finished his bread and cheese, and, having
taken a final draught of tea, he rose to his feet, and crossing over to
the corner of the room, ascended the pulpit, being immediately greeted
with a tremendous outburst of hooting, howling and booing, which he
smilingly acknowledged by removing his cap from his bald head and
bowing repeatedly.When the storm of shrieks, yells, groans and
catcalls had in some degree subsided, and Philpot was able to make
himself heard, he addressed the meeting as follows:

'Gentlemen: First of all I beg to thank you very sincerely for the
magnificent and cordial reception you have given me on this occasion,
and I shall try to deserve your good opinion by opening the meeting as
briefly as possible.'Putting all jokes aside, I think we're all agreed about one thing, and
that is, that there's plenty of room for improvement in things in
general.As our other lecturer, Professor Owen, pointed
out in one of 'is lectures and as most of you 'ave read in the
newspapers, although British trade was never so good before as it is
now, there was never so much misery and poverty, and so many people out
of work, and so many small shopkeepers goin' up the spout as there is
at this partickiler time.Now, some people tells us as the way to put
everything right is to 'ave Free Trade and plenty of cheap food.Well,
we've got them all now, but the misery seems to go on all around us all
the same.Then there's other people tells us as the 'Friscal Policy'
is the thing to put everything right.("Hear, hear" from Crass and
several others.)And then there's another lot that ses that Socialism
is the only remedy.Well, we all know pretty well wot Free Trade and
Protection means, but most of us don't know exactly what Socialism
means; and I say as it's the dooty of every man to try and find out
which is the right thing to vote for, and when 'e's found it out, to do
wot 'e can to 'elp to bring it about.And that's the reason we've gorn
to the enormous expense of engaging Professor Barrington to come 'ere
this afternoon and tell us exactly what Socialism is.''As I 'ope you're all just as anxious to 'ear it as I am myself, I
will not stand between you and the lecturer no longer, but will now
call upon 'im to address you.'Philpot was loudly applauded as he descended from the pulpit, and in
response to the clamorous demands of the crowd, Barrington, who in the
meantime had yielded to Owen's entreaties that he would avail himself
of this opportunity of proclaiming the glad tidings of the good time
that is to be, got up on the steps in his turn.Harlow, desiring that everything should be done decently and in order,
had meantime arranged in front of the pulpit a carpenter's sawing
stool, and an empty pail with a small piece of board laid across it, to
serve as a seat and a table for the chairman.Over the table he draped
a large red handkerchief.At the right he placed a plumber's large
hammer; at the left, a battered and much-chipped jam-jar, full of tea.Philpot having taken his seat on the pail at this table and announced
his intention of bashing out with the hammer the brains of any
individual who ventured to disturb the meeting, Barrington commenced:

'Mr Chairman and Gentlemen.For the sake of clearness, and in order to
avoid confusing one subject with another, I have decided to divide the
oration into two parts.First, I will try to explain as well as I am
able what Socialism is.I will try to describe to you the plan or
system upon which the Co-operative Commonwealth of the future will be
organized; and, secondly, I will try to tell you how it can be brought
about.But before proceeding with the first part of the subject, I
would like to refer very slightly to the widespread delusion that
Socialism is impossible because it means a complete change from an
order of things which has always existed.We constantly hear it said
that because there have always been rich and poor in the world, there
always must be.I want to point out to you first of all, that it is
not true that even in its essential features, the present system has
existed from all time; it is not true that there have always been rich
and poor in the world, in the sense that we understand riches and
poverty today.'These statements are lies that have been invented for the purpose of
creating in us a feeling of resignation to the evils of our condition.They are lies which have been fostered by those who imagine that it is
to their interest that we should be content to see our children
condemned to the same poverty and degradation that we have endured
ourselves.I do not propose--because there is not time, although it is really part
of my subject--to go back to the beginnings of history, and describe in
detail the different systems of social organization which evolved from
and superseded each other at different periods, but it is necessary to
remind you that the changes that have taken place in the past have been
even greater than the change proposed by Socialists today.The change
from savagery and cannibalism when men used to devour the captives they
took in war--to the beginning of chattel slavery, when the tribes or
clans into which mankind were divided--whose social organization was a
kind of Communism, all the individuals belonging to the tribe being
practically social equals, members of one great family--found it more
profitable to keep their captives as slaves than to eat them.The
change from the primitive Communism of the tribes, into the more
individualistic organization of the nations, and the development of
private ownership of the land and slaves and means of subsistence.The
change from chattel slavery into Feudalism; and the change from
Feudalism into the earlier form of Capitalism; and the equally great
change from what might be called the individualistic capitalism which
displaced Feudalism, to the system of Co-operative Capitalism and Wage
Slavery of today.''I believe you must 'ave swollered a bloody dictionary,' exclaimed the
man behind the moat.'Keep horder,' shouted Philpot, fiercely, striking the table with the
hammer, and there were loud shouts of 'Chair' and 'Chuck 'im out,' from
several quarters.When order was restored, the lecturer proceeded:

'So it is not true that practically the same state of affairs as we
have today has always existed.It is not true that anything like the
poverty that prevails at present existed at any previous period of the
world's history.When the workers were the property of their masters,
it was to their owners' interest to see that they were properly clothed
and fed; they were not allowed to be idle, and they were not allowed to
starve.Under Feudalism also, although there were certain intolerable
circumstances, the position of the workers was, economically,
infinitely better than it is today.The worker was in subjection to
his Lord, but in return his lord had certain responsibilities and
duties to perform, and there was a large measure of community of
interest between them.'I do not intend to dwell upon this pout at length, but in support of
what I have said I will quote as nearly as I can from memory the words
of the historian Froude.'"I do not believe," says Mr Froude, "that the condition of the people
in Mediaeval Europe was as miserable as is pretended.I do not believe
that the distribution of the necessaries of life was as unequal as it
is at present.If the tenant lived hard, the lord had little luxury.Earls and countesses breakfasted at five in the morning, on salt beef
and herring, a slice of bread and a draught of ale from a blackjack.Lords and servants dined in the same hall and shared the same meal."'When we arrive at the system that displaced Feudalism, we find that
the condition of the workers was better in every way than it is at
present.The instruments of production--the primitive machinery and
the tools necessary for the creation of wealth--belonged to the skilled
workers who used them, and the things they produced were also the
property of those who made them.'In those days a master painter, a master shoemaker, a master saddler,
or any other master tradesmen, was really a skilled artisan working on
his own account.He usually had one or two apprentices, who were
socially his equals, eating at the same table and associating with the
other members of his family.It was quite a common occurrence for the
apprentice--after he had attained proficiency in his work--to marry his
master's daughter and succeed to his master's business.In those days
to be a "master" tradesman meant to be master of the trade, not merely
of some underpaid drudges in one's employment.The apprentices were
there to master the trade, qualifying themselves to become master
workers themselves; not mere sweaters and exploiters of the labour of
others, but useful members of society.In those days, because there
was no labour-saving machinery the community was dependent for its
existence on the productions of hand labour.Consequently the majority
of the people were employed in some kind of productive work, and the
workers were honoured and respected citizens, living in comfort on the
fruits of their labour.They were not rich as we understand wealth
now, but they did not starve and they were not regarded with contempt,
as are their successors of today.'The next great change came with the introduction of steam machinery.That power came to the aid of mankind in their struggle for existence,
enabling them to create easily and in abundance those things of which
they had previously been able to produce only a bare sufficiency.A
wonderful power--equalling and surpassing the marvels that were
imagined by the writers of fairy tales and Eastern stories--a power so
vast--so marvellous, that it is difficult to find words to convey
anything like an adequate conception of it.'We all remember the story, in The Arabian Nights, of Aladdin, who in
his poverty became possessed of the Wonderful Lamp and--he was poor no
longer.He merely had to rub the Lamp--the Genie appeared, and at
Aladdin's command he produced an abundance of everything that the youth
could ask or dream of.With the discovery of steam machinery, mankind
became possessed of a similar power to that imagined by the Eastern
writer.At the command of its masters the Wonderful Lamp of Machinery
produces an enormous, overwhelming, stupendous abundance and
superfluity of every material thing necessary for human existence and
happiness.With less labour than was formerly required to cultivate
acres, we can now cultivate miles of land.In response to human
industry, aided by science and machinery, the fruitful earth teems with
such lavish abundance as was never known or deemed possible before.If
you go into the different factories and workshops you will see
prodigious quantities of commodities of every kind pouring out of the
wonderful machinery, literally like water from a tap.'One would naturally and reasonably suppose that the discovery or
invention of such an aid to human industry would result in increased
happiness and comfort for every one; but as you all know, the reverse
is the case; and the reason of that extraordinary result, is the reason
of all the poverty and unhappiness that we see around us and endure
today--it is simply because--the machinery became the property of a
comparatively few individuals and private companies, who use it not for
the benefit of the community but to create profits for themselves.'As this labour-saving machinery became more extensively used, the
prosperous class of skilled workers gradually disappeared.Some of the
wealthier of them became distributers instead of producers of wealth;
that is to say, they became shopkeepers, retailing the commodities that
were produced for the most part by machinery.But the majority of them
in course of time degenerated into a class of mere wage earners, having
no property in the machines they used, and no property in the things
they made.'They sold their labour for so much per hour, and when they could not
find any employer to buy it from them, they were reduced to destitution.'Whilst the unemployed workers were starving and those in employment
not much better off, the individuals and private companies who owned
the machinery accumulated fortunes; but their profits were diminished
and their working expenses increased by what led to the latest great
change in the organization of the production of the necessaries of
life--the formation of the Limited Companies and the Trusts; the
decision of the private companies to combine and co-operate with each
other in order to increase their profits and decrease their working
expenses.The results of these combines have been--an increase in the
quantities of the things produced: a decrease in the number of wage
earners employed--and enormously increased profits for the shareholders.'But it is not only the wage-earning class that is being hurt; for
while they are being annihilated by the machinery and the efficient
organization of industry by the trusts that control and are beginning
to monopolize production, the shopkeeping classes are also being slowly
but surely crushed out of existence by the huge companies that are able
by the greater magnitude of their operations to buy and sell more
cheaply than the small traders.'The consequence of all this is that the majority of the people are in
a condition of more or less abject poverty--living from hand to mouth.It is an admitted fact that about thirteen millions of our people are
always on the verge of starvation.The significant results of this
poverty face us on every side.The alarming and persistent increase of
insanity.The large number of would-be recruits for the army who have
to be rejected because they are physically unfit; and the shameful
condition of the children of the poor.More than one-third of the
children of the working classes in London have some sort of mental or
physical defect; defects in development; defects of eyesight; abnormal
nervousness; rickets, and mental dullness.The difference in height
and weight and general condition of the children in poor schools and
the children of the so-called better classes, constitutes a crime that
calls aloud to Heaven for vengeance upon those who are responsible for
it.'It is childish to imagine that any measure of Tariff Reform or
Political Reform such as a paltry tax on foreign-made goods or
abolishing the House of Lords, or disestablishing the Church--or
miserable Old Age Pensions, or a contemptible tax on land, can deal
with such a state of affairs as this.They have no House of Lords in
America or France, and yet their condition is not materially different
from ours.You may be deceived into thinking that such measures as
those are great things.You may fight for them and vote for them, but
after you have got them you will find that they will make no
appreciable improvement in your condition.You will still have to
slave and drudge to gain a bare sufficiency of the necessaries of life.You will still have to eat the same kind of food and wear the same kind
of clothes and boots as now.Your masters will still have you in their
power to insult and sweat and drive.Your general condition will be
just the same as at present because such measures as those are not
remedies but red herrings, intended by those who trail them to draw us
away from the only remedy, which is to be found only in the Public
Ownership of the Machinery, and the National Organization of Industry
for the production and distribution of the necessaries of life, not for
the profit of a few but for the benefit of all!'That is the next great change; not merely desirable, but imperatively
necessary and inevitable!'It is not a wild dream of Superhuman Unselfishness.No one will be
asked to sacrifice himself for the benefit of others or to love his
neighbours better than himself as is the case under the present system,
which demands that the majority shall unselfishly be content to labour
and live in wretchedness for the benefit of a few.There is no such
principle of Philanthropy in Socialism, which simply means that even as
all industries are now owned by shareholders, and organized and
directed by committees and officers elected by the shareholders, so
shall they in future belong to the State, that is, the whole
people--and they shall be organized and directed by committees and
officers elected by the community.'Under existing circumstances the community is exposed to the danger of
being invaded and robbed and massacred by some foreign power.Therefore
the community has organized and owns and controls an Army and Navy to
protect it from that danger.Under existing circumstances the
community is menaced by another equally great danger--the people are
mentally and physically degenerating from lack of proper food and
clothing.Socialists say that the community should undertake and
organize the business of producing and distributing all these things;
that the State should be the only employer of labour and should own all
the factories, mills, mines, farms, railways, fishing fleets, sheep
farms, poultry farms and cattle ranches.'Under existing circumstances the community is degenerating mentally
and physically because the majority cannot afford to have decent houses
to live in.Socialists say that the community should take in hand the
business of providing proper houses for all its members, that the State
should be the only landlord, that all the land and all the houses
should belong to the whole people...

'We must do this if we are to keep our old place in the van of human
progress.A nation of ignorant, unintelligent, half-starved,
broken-spirited degenerates cannot hope to lead humanity in its
never-ceasing march onward to the conquest of the future.'Vain, mightiest fleet of iron framed;
        Vain the all-shattering guns
        Unless proud England keep, untamed,
        The stout hearts of her sons.'All the evils that I have referred to are only symptoms of the one
disease that is sapping the moral, mental and physical life of the
nation, and all attempts to cure these symptoms are foredoomed to
failure, simply because they are the symptoms and not the disease.All
the talk of Temperance, and the attempts to compel temperance, are
foredoomed to failure, because drunkenness is a symptom, and not the
disease.Every year millions of pounds
worth of wealth are produced by her people, only to be stolen from them
by means of the Money Trick by the capitalist and official class.Her
industrious sons and daughters, who are nearly all total abstainers,
live in abject poverty, and their misery is not caused by laziness or
want of thrift, or by Intemperance.They are poor for the same reason
that we are poor--Because we are Robbed.'The hundreds of thousands of pounds that are yearly wasted in
well-meant but useless charity accomplish no lasting good, because
while charity soothes the symptoms it ignores the disease, which
is--the PRIVATE OWNERSHIP of the means of producing the necessaries of
life, and the restriction of production, by a few selfish individuals
for their own profit.And for that disease there is no other remedy
than the one I have told you of--the PUBLIC OWNERSHIP and cultivation
of the land, the PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF the mines, railways, canals,
ships, factories and all the other means of production, and the
establishment of an Industrial Civil Service--a National Army of
Industry--for the purpose of producing the necessaries, comforts and
refinements of life in that abundance which has been made possible by
science and machinery--for the use and benefit of THE WHOLE OF THE
PEOPLE.''Yes: and where's the money to come from for all this?'shouted Crass,
fiercely.'Hear, hear,' cried the man behind the moat.'There's no money difficulty about it,' replied Barrington.'We can
easily find all the money we shall need.''Of course,' said Slyme, who had been reading the Daily Ananias,
'there's all the money in the Post Office Savings Bank.The Socialists
could steal that for a start; and as for the mines and land and
factories, they can all be took from the owners by force.''There will be no need for force and no need to steal anything from
anybody.''And there's another thing I objects to,' said Crass.'And that's all
this 'ere talk about hignorance: wot about all the money wots spent
every year for edication?''You should rather say--"What about all the money that's wasted every
year on education?"What can be more brutal and senseless than trying
to "educate" a poor little, hungry, ill-clad child?Such so-called
"instruction" is like the seed in the parable of the Sower, which fell
on stony ground and withered away because it had no depth of earth; and
even in those cases where it does take root and grow, it becomes like
the seed that fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it,
and it bore no fruit.'The majority of us forget in a year or two all that we learnt at
school because the conditions of our lives are such as to destroy all
inclination for culture or refinement.We must see that the children
are properly clothed and fed and that they are not made to get up in
the middle of the night to go to work for several hours before they go
to school.We must make it illegal for any greedy, heartless
profit-hunter to hire them and make them labour for several hours in
the evening after school, or all day and till nearly midnight on
Saturday.We must first see that our children are cared for, as well
as the children of savage races, before we can expect a proper return
for the money that we spend on education.''I don't mind admitting that this 'ere scheme of national ownership and
industries is all right if it could only be done,' said Harlow, 'but at
present, all the land, railways and factories, belongs to private
capitalists; they can't be bought without money, and you say you ain't
goin' to take 'em away by force, so I should like to know how the
bloody 'ell you are goin' to get 'em?''We certainly don't propose to buy them with money, for the simple
reason that there is not sufficient money in existence to pay for them.'If all the gold and silver money in the World were gathered together
into one heap, it would scarcely be sufficient to buy all the private
property in England.The people who own all these things now never
really paid for them with money--they obtained possession of them by
means of the "Money Trick" which Owen explained to us some time ago.''They obtained possession of them by usin' their brain,' said Crass.'They tell us themselves that that is
how they got them away from us; they call their profits the "wages of
intelligence".Whilst we have been working, they have been using their
intelligence in order to obtain possession of the things we have
created.The time has now arrived for us to use our intelligence in
order to get back the things they have robbed us of, aid to prevent
them from robbing us any more.As for how it is to be done, we might
copy the methods that they have found so successful.''Oh, then you DO mean to rob them after all,' cried Slyme,
triumphantly.'If it's true that they robbed the workers, and if we're
to adopt the same method then we'll be robbers too!''When a thief is caught having in his possession the property of others
it is not robbery to take the things away from him and to restore them
to their rightful owners,' retorted Barrington.'I can't allow this 'ere disorder to go on no longer,' shouted Philpot,
banging the table with the plumber's hammer as several men began
talking at the same time.'There will be plenty of tuneropperty for questions and opposition at
the hend of the horation, when the pulpit will be throwed open to
anyone as likes to debate the question.I now calls upon the professor
to proceed with the second part of the horation: and anyone wot
interrupts will get a lick under the ear-'ole with this'--waving the
hammer--'and the body will be chucked out of the bloody winder.'It was still raining heavily,
so they thought they might as well pass the time listening to
Barrington as in any other way.'A large part of the land may be got back in the same way as it was
taken from us.The ancestors of the present holders obtained
possession of it by simply passing Acts of Enclosure: the nation should
regain possession of those lands by passing Acts of Resumption.And
with regard to the other land, the present holders should be allowed to
retain possession of it during their lives and then it should revert to
the State, to be used for the benefit of all.Britain should belong to
the British people, not to a few selfish individuals.As for the
railways, they have already been nationalized in some other countries,
and what other countries can do we can do also.In New Zealand,
Australia, South Africa, Germany, Belgium, Italy, Japan and some other
countries some of the railways are already the property of the State.As for the method by which we can obtain possession of them, the
difficulty is not to discover a method, but rather to decide which of
many methods we shall adopt.One method would be to simply pass an Act
declaring that as it was contrary to the public interest that they
should be owned by private individuals, the railways would henceforth
be the property of the nation.All railways servants, managers and
officials would continue in their employment; the only difference being
that they would now be in the employ of the State.As to the
shareholders--'

'They could all be knocked on the 'ead, I suppose,' interrupted Crass.'Or go to the workhouse,' said Slyme.'Or to 'ell,' suggested the man behind the moat.

'--The State would continue to pay to the shareholders the same
dividends they had received on an average for, say, the previous three
years.These payments would be continued to the present shareholders
for life, or the payments might be limited to a stated number of years
and the shares would be made non-transferable, like the railway tickets
of today.As for the factories, shops, and other means of production
and distribution, the State must adopt the same methods of doing
business as the present owners.I mean that even as the big Trusts and
companies are crushing--by competition--the individual workers and
small traders, so the State should crush the trusts by competition.It
is surely justifiable for the State to do for the benefit of the whole
people that which the capitalists are already doing for the profit of a
few shareholders.The first step in this direction will be the
establishment of Retail Stores for the purpose of supplying all
national and municipal employees with the necessaries of life at the
lowest possible prices.At first the Administration will purchase
these things from the private manufacturers, in such large quantities
that it will be able to obtain them at the very cheapest rate, and as
there will be no heavy rents to pay for showy shops, and no advertising
expenses, and as the object of the Administration will be not to make
profit, but to supply its workmen and officials with goods at the
lowest price, they will be able to sell them much cheaper than the
profit-making private stores.'The National Service Retail Stores will be for the benefit of only
those in the public service; and gold, silver or copper money will not
be accepted in payment for the things sold.At first, all public
servants will continue to be paid in metal money, but those who desire
it will be paid all or part of their wages in paper money of the same
nominal value, which will be accepted in payment for their purchases at
the National Stores and at the National Hotels, Restaurants and other
places which will be established for the convenience of those in the
State service.It will be made of
a special very strong paper, and will be of all value, from a penny to
a pound.'As the National Service Stores will sell practically everything that
could be obtained elsewhere, and as twenty shillings in paper money
will be able to purchase much more at the stores than twenty shillings
of metal money would purchase anywhere else, it will not be long before
nearly all public servants will prefer to be paid in paper money.As
far as paying the salaries and wages of most of its officials and
workmen is concerned, the Administration will not then have any need of
metal money.But it will require metal money to pay the private
manufacturers who supply the goods sold in the National Stores.But--all these things are made by labour; so in order to avoid having
to pay metal money for them, the State will now commence to employ
productive labour.All the public land suitable for the purpose will
be put into cultivation and State factories will be established for
manufacturing food, boots, clothing, furniture and all other
necessaries and comforts of life.All those who are out of employment
and willing to work, will be given employment on these farms and in
these factories.In order that the men employed shall not have to work
unpleasantly hard, and that their hours of labour may be as short as
possible--at first, say, eight hours per day--and also to make sure
that the greatest possible quantity of everything shall be produced,
these factories and farms will be equipped with the most up-to-date and
efficient labour-saving machinery.The people employed in the farms
and factories will be paid with paper money... The commodities they
produce will go to replenish the stocks of the National Service Stores,
where the workers will be able to purchase with their paper money
everything they need.'As we shall employ the greatest possible number of labour-saving
machines, and adopt the most scientific methods in our farms and
factories, the quantities of goods we shall be able to produce will be
so enormous that we shall be able to pay our workers very high
wages--in paper money--and we shall be able to sell our produce so
cheaply, that all public servants will be able to enjoy abundance of
everything.'When the workers who are being exploited and sweated by the private
capitalists realize how much worse off they are than the workers in the
employ of the State, they will come and ask to be allowed to work for
the State, and also, for paper money.That will mean that the State
Army of Productive Workers will be continually increasing in numbers.More State factories will be built, more land will be put into
cultivation.Men will be given employment making bricks, woodwork,
paints, glass, wallpapers and all kinds of building materials and
others will be set to work building--on State land--beautiful houses,
which will be let to those employed in the service of the State.The
rent will be paid with paper money.'State fishing fleets will be established and the quantities of
commodities of all kinds produced will be so great that the State
employees and officials will not be able to use it all.With their
paper money they will be able to buy enough and more than enough to
satisfy all their needs abundantly, but there will still be a great and
continuously increasing surplus stock in the possession of the State.'The Socialist Administration will now acquire or build fleets of steam
trading vessels, which will of course be manned and officered by State
employees--the same as the Royal Navy is now.These fleets of National
trading vessels will carry the surplus stocks I have mentioned, to
foreign countries, and will there sell or exchange them for some of the
products of those countries, things that we do not produce ourselves.These things will be brought to England and sold at the National
Service Stores, at the lowest possible price, for paper money, to those
in the service of the State.This of course will only have the effect
of introducing greater variety into the stocks--it will not diminish
the surplus: and as there would be no sense in continuing to produce
more of these things than necessary, it would then be the duty of the
Administration to curtail or restrict production of the necessaries of
life.This could be done by reducing the hours of the workers without
reducing their wages so as to enable them to continue to purchase as
much as before.'Another way of preventing over production of mere necessaries and
comforts will be to employ a large number of workers producing the
refinements and pleasures of life, more artistic houses, furniture,
pictures, musical instruments and so forth.'In the centre of every district a large Institute or pleasure house
could be erected, containing a magnificently appointed and decorated
theatre; Concert Hall, Lecture Hall, Gymnasium, Billiard Rooms, Reading
Rooms, Refreshment Rooms, and so on.A detachment of the Industrial
Army would be employed as actors, artistes, musicians, singers and
entertainers.In fact everyone that could be spared from the most
important work of all--that of producing the necessaries of life--would
be employed in creating pleasure, culture, and education.All these
people--like the other branches of the public service--would be paid
with paper money, and with it all of them would be able to purchase
abundance of all those things which constitute civilization.'Meanwhile, as a result of all this, the kind-hearted private employers
and capitalists would find that no one would come and work for them to
be driven and bullied and sweated for a miserable trifle of metal money
that is scarcely enough to purchase sufficient of the necessaries of
life to keep body and soul together.'These kind-hearted capitalists will protest against what they will
call the unfair competition of State industry, and some of them may
threaten to leave the country and take their capital with them...  As
most of these persons are too lazy to work, and as we will not need
their money, we shall be very glad to see them go.But with regard to
their real capital--their factories, farms, mines or machinery--that
will be a different matter...  To allow these things to remain idle and
unproductive would constitute an injury to the community.So a law
will be passed, declaring that all land not cultivated by the owner, or
any factory shut down for more than a specified time, will be taken
possession of by the State and worked for the benefit of the
community...  Fair compensation will be paid in paper money to the
former owners, who will be granted an income or pension of so much a
year either for life or for a stated period according to circumstances
and the ages of the persons concerned.'As for the private traders, the wholesale and retail dealers in the
things produced by labour, they will be forced by the State competition
to close down their shops and warehouses--first, because they will not
be able to replenish their stocks; and, secondly, because even if they
were able to do so, they would not be able to sell them.This will
throw out of work a great host of people who are at present engaged in
useless occupations; the managers and assistants in the shops of which
we now see half a dozen of the same sort in a single street; the
thousands of men and women who are slaving away their lives producing
advertisements, for, in most cases, a miserable pittance of metal
money, with which many of them are unable to procure sufficient of the
necessaries of life to secure them from starvation.'The masons, carpenters, painters, glaziers, and all the others engaged
in maintaining these unnecessary stores and shops will all be thrown
out of employment, but all of them who are willing to work will be
welcomed by the State and will be at once employed helping either to
produce or distribute the necessaries and comforts of life.They will
have to work fewer hours than before...  They will not have to work so
hard--for there will be no need to drive or bully, because there will
be plenty of people to do the work, and most of it will be done by
machinery--and with their paper money they will be able to buy
abundance of the things they help to produce.The shops and stores
where these people were formerly employed will be acquired by the
State, which will pay the former owners fair compensation in the same
manner as to the factory owners.Some of the buildings will be
utilized by the State as National Service Stores, others transformed
into factories and others will be pulled down to make room for
dwellings, or public buildings...  It will be the duty of the
Government to build a sufficient number of houses to accommodate the
families of all those in its employment, and as a consequence of this
and because of the general disorganization and decay of what is now
called "business", all other house property of all kinds will rapidly
depreciate in value.The slums and the wretched dwellings now occupied
by the working classes--the miserable, uncomfortable, jerry-built
"villas" occupied by the lower middle classes and by "business" people,
will be left empty and valueless upon the hands of their rack renting
landlords, who will very soon voluntarily offer to hand them and the
ground they stand upon to the state on the same terms as those accorded
to the other property owners, namely--in return for a pension.Some of
these people will be content to live in idleness on the income allowed
them for life as compensation by the State: others will devote
themselves to art or science and some others will offer their services
to the community as managers and superintendents, and the State will
always be glad to employ all those who are willing to help in the Great
Work of production and distribution.'By this time the nation will be the sole employer of labour, and as no
one will be able to procure the necessaries of life without paper
money, and as the only way to obtain this will be working, it will mean
that every mentally and physically capable person in the community will
be helping in the great work of PRODUCTION and DISTRIBUTION.We shall
not need as at present, to maintain a police force to protect the
property of the idle rich from the starving wretches whom they have
robbed.There will be no unemployed and no overlapping of labour,
which will be organized and concentrated for the accomplishment of the
only rational object--the creation of the things we require...  For
every one labour-saving machine in use today, we will, if necessary,
employ a thousand machines!and consequently there will be produced
such a stupendous, enormous, prodigious, overwhelming abundance of
everything that soon the Community will be faced once more with the
serious problem of OVER-PRODUCTION.'To deal with this, it will be necessary to reduce the hours of our
workers to four or five hours a day...  All young people will be
allowed to continue at public schools and universities and will not be
required to take any part in the work or the nation until they are
twenty-one years of age.At the age of forty-five, everyone will be
allowed to retire from the State service on full pay...  All these will
be able to spend the rest of their days according to their own
inclinations; some will settle down quietly at home, and amuse
themselves in the same ways as people of wealth and leisure do at the
present day--with some hobby, or by taking part in the organization of
social functions, such as balls, parties, entertainments, the
organization of Public Games and Athletic Tournaments, Races and all
kinds of sports.'Some will prefer to continue in the service of the State.Actors,
artists, sculptors, musicians and others will go on working for their
own pleasure and honour...  Some will devote their leisure to science,
art, or literature.Others will prefer to travel on the State
steamships to different parts of the world to see for themselves all
those things of which most of us have now but a dim and vague
conception.The wonders of India and Egypt, the glories of Rome, the
artistic treasures of the continent and the sublime scenery of other
lands.'Thus--for the first time in the history of humanity--the benefits and
pleasures conferred upon mankind by science and civilization will be
enjoyed equally by all, upon the one condition, that they shall do
their share of the work, that is necessary in order to, make all these
things possible.'These are the principles upon which the CO-OPERATIVE COMMONWEALTH of
the future will be organized.The State in which no one will be
distinguished or honoured above his fellows except for Virtue or
Talent.Where no man will find his profit in another's loss, and we
shall no longer be masters and servants, but brothers, free men, and
friends.Where there will be no weary, broken men and women passing
their joyless lives in toil and want, and no little children crying
because they are hungry or cold.'A State wherein it will be possible to put into practice the teachings
of Him whom so many now pretend to follow.A society which shall have
justice and co-operation for its foundation, and International
Brotherhood and love for its law.but
        What are the deeds of today,
        In the days of the years we dwell in,
        That wear our lives away?Why, then, and for what we are waiting?There are but three words to speak
        "We will it," and what is the foreman
        but the dream strong wakened and weak?'Oh, why and for what are we waiting, while
        our brothers droop and die?And on every wind of the heavens, a
        wasted life goes by.'How long shall they reproach us, where
        crowd on crowd they dwell
        Poor ghosts of the wicked city,
        gold crushed, hungry hell?'Through squalid life they laboured in
        sordid grief they died
        Those sons of a mighty mother, those
        props of England's pride.They are gone, there is none can undo
        it, nor save our souls from the curse,
        But many a million cometh, and shall
        they be better or worse?'It is We must answer and hasten and open wide the door,
        For the rich man's hurrying terror, and the slow foot hope of
        the poor,
        Yea, the voiceless wrath of the wretched and their unlearned
        discontent,
        We must give it voice and wisdom, till the waiting tide be
        spent
        Come then since all things call us, the living and the dead,
        And o'er the weltering tangle a glimmering light is shed.'As Barrington descended from the Pulpit and walked back to his
accustomed seat, a loud shout of applause burst from a few men in the
crowd, who stood up and waved their caps and cheered again and again.When order was restored, Philpot rose and addressed the meeting:

'Is there any gentleman wot would like to ask the Speaker a question?'No one spoke and the Chairman again put the question without obtaining
any response, but at length one of the new hands who had been 'taken
on' about a week previously to replace another painter who had been
sacked for being too slow--stood up and said there was one point that
he would like a little more information about.This man had two
patches on the seat of his trousers, which were also very much frayed
and ragged at the bottoms of the legs: the lining of his coat was all
in rags, as were also the bottoms of the sleeves; his boots were old
and had been many times mended and patched; the sole of one of them had
begun to separate from the upper and he had sewn these parts together
with a few stitches of copper wire.He had been out of employment for
several weeks and it was evident from the pinched expression of his
still haggard face that during that time he had not had sufficient to
eat.This man was not a drunkard, neither was he one of those
semi-mythical persons who are too lazy to work.He was married and had
several children.One of them, a boy of fourteen years old, earned
five shillings a week as a light porter at a Grocer's.Being a householder the man had a vote, but he had never hitherto taken
much interest in what he called 'politics'.In his opinion, those
matters were not for the likes of him.He believed in leaving such
difficult subjects to be dealt with by his betters.In his present
unhappy condition he was a walking testimonial to the wisdom and virtue
and benevolence of those same 'betters' who have hitherto managed the
affairs of the world with results so very satisfactory for themselves.'I should like to ask the speaker,' he said,'supposin' all this that
'e talks about is done--what's to become of the King, and the Royal
Family, and all the Big Pots?'''Ear, 'ear,' cried Crass, eagerly--and Ned Dawson and the man behind
the moat both said that that was what they would like to know, too.'I am much more concerned about what is to become of ourselves if these
things are not done,' replied Barrington.'I think we should try to
cultivate a little more respect of our own families and to concern
ourselves a little less about "Royal" Families.I fail to see any
reason why we should worry ourselves about those people; they're all
right--they have all they need, and as far as I am aware, nobody wishes
to harm them and they are well able to look after themselves.They will
fare the same as the other rich people.''I should like to ask,' said Harlow, 'wot's to become of all the gold
and silver and copper money?Wouldn't it be of no use at all?''It would be of far more use under Socialism than it is at present.The
State would of course become possessed of a large quantity of it in the
early stages of the development of the Socialist system, because--at
first--while the State would be paying all its officers and productive
workers in paper, the rest of the community--those not in State
employ--would be paying their taxes in gold as at present.All
travellers on the State railways--other than State employees--would pay
their fares in metal money, and gold and silver would pour into the
State Treasury from many other sources.The State would receive gold
and silver and--for the most part--pay out paper.By the time the
system of State employment was fully established, gold and silver would
only be of value as metal and the State would purchase it from whoever
possessed and wished to sell it--at so much per pound as raw material:
instead of hiding it away in the vaults of banks, or locking it up in
iron safes, we shall make use of it.Some of the gold will be
manufactured into articles of jewellery, to be sold for paper money and
worn by the sweethearts and wives and daughters of the workers; some of
it will be beaten out into gold leaf to be used in the decoration of
the houses of the citizens and of public buildings.As for the silver,
it will be made into various articles of utility for domestic use.The
workers will not then, as now, have to eat their food with poisonous
lead or brass spoons and forks, we shall have these things of silver
and if there is not enough silver we shall probably have a
non-poisonous alloy of that metal.''As far as I can make out,' said Harlow, 'the paper money will be just
as valuable as gold and silver is now.Well, wot's to prevent artful
dodgers like old Misery and Rushton saving it up and buying and selling
things with it, and so livin' without work?''Of course,' said Crass, scornfully.'That's a very simple matter; any man who lives without doing any
useful work is living on the labour of others, he is robbing others of
part of the result of their labour.The object of Socialism is to stop
this robbery, to make it impossible.So no one will be able to hoard
up or accumulate the paper money because it will be dated, and will
become worthless if it is not spent within a certain time after its
issue.As for buying and selling for profit--from whom would they buy?'Well, they might buy some of the things the workers didn't want, for
less than the workers paid for them, and then they could sell 'em
again.''They'd have to sell them for less than the price charged at the
National Stores, and if you think about it a little you'll see that it
would not be very profitable.It would be with the object of
preventing any attempts at private trading that the Administration
would refuse to pay compensation to private owners in a lump sum.All
such compensations would be paid, as I said, in the form of a pension
of so much per year.'Another very effective way to prevent private trading would be to make
it a criminal offence against the well-being of the community.At
present many forms of business are illegal unless you take out a
licence; under Socialism no one would be allowed to trade without a
licence, and no licences would be issued.''Wouldn't a man be allowed to save up his money if he wanted to,
demanded Slyme with indignation.'There will be nothing to prevent a man going without some of the
things he might have if he is foolish enough to do so, but he would
never be able to save up enough to avoid doing his share of useful
service.Besides, what need would there be for anyone to save?One's
old age would be provided for.If one was ill the State hospitals and Medical Service would be free.As for one's children, they would attend the State Free Schools and
Colleges and when of age they would enter the State Service, their
futures provided for.Can you tell us why anyone would need or wish to
save?''While we are speaking of money,' added Barrington, 'I should like to
remind you that even under the present system there are many things
which cost money to maintain, that we enjoy without having to pay for
directly.The public roads and pavements cost money to make and
maintain and light.Under a Socialist Administration this principle will
be extended--in addition to the free services we enjoy now we shall
then maintain the trains and railways for the use of the public, free.And as time goes on, this method of doing business will be adopted in
many other directions.''I've read somewhere,' said Harlow, 'that whenever a Government in any
country has started issuing paper money it has always led to
bankruptcy.How do you know that the same thing would not happen under
a Socialist Administration?'''Ear, 'ear,' said Crass.'I was just goin' to say the same thing.''If the Government of a country began to issue large amounts of paper
money under the present system,' Barrington replied, 'it would
inevitably lead to bankruptcy, for the simple reason that paper money
under the present system--bank-notes, bank drafts, postal orders,
cheques or any other form--is merely a printed promise to pay the
amount--in gold or silver--on demand or at a certain date.Under the
present system if a Government issues more paper money than it
possesses gold and silver to redeem, it is of course bankrupt.But the
paper money that will be issued under a Socialist Administration will
not be a promise to pay in gold or silver on demand or at any time.It
will be a promise to supply commodities to the amount specified on the
note, and as there could be no dearth of those things there could be no
possibility of bankruptcy.''I should like to know who's goin' to appoint the hofficers of this
'ere hindustrial harmy,' said the man on the pail.'We don't want to
be bullied and chivied and chased about by a lot of sergeants and
corporals like a lot of soldiers, you know.'''Ear, 'ear,' said Crass.Someone's got
to be in charge of the work.''We don't have to put up with any bullying or chivying or chasing now,
do we?''So of course we could not have anything of
that sort under Socialism.We could not put up with it at all!Even
if it were only for four or five hours a day.Under the present system
we have no voice in appointing our masters and overseers and
foremen--we have no choice as to what master we shall work under.If
our masters do not treat us fairly we have no remedy against them.Under Socialism it will be different; the workers will be part of the
community; the officers or managers and foremen will be the servants of
the community, and if any one of these men were to abuse his position
he could be promptly removed.As for the details of the organization
of the Industrial Army, the difficulty is, again, not so much to devise
a way, but to decide which of many ways would be the best, and the
perfect way will probably be developed only after experiment and
experience.The one thing we have to hold fast to is the fundamental
principle of State employment or National service.The national organization of industry under
democratic control.One way of arranging this business would be for
the community to elect a Parliament in much the same way as is done at
present.The only persons eligible for election to be veterans of the
industrial Army, men and women who had put in their twenty-five years
of service.'This Administrative Body would have control of the different State
Departments.There would be a Department of Agriculture, a Department
of Railways and so on, each with its minister and staff.'All these Members of Parliament would be the relatives--in some cases
the mothers and fathers of those in the Industrial Service, and they
would be relied upon to see that the conditions of that service were
the best possible.'As for the different branches of the State Service, they could be
organized on somewhat the same lines as the different branches of the
Public Service are now--like the Navy, the Post Office and as the State
Railways in some other countries, or as are the different branches of
the Military Army, with the difference that all promotions will be from
the ranks, by examinations, and by merit only.As every recruit will
have had the same class of education they will all have absolute
equality of opportunity and the men who would attain to positions of
authority would be the best men, and not as at present, the worst.''Under the present system, the men who become masters and employers
succeed because they are cunning and selfish, not because they
understand or are capable of doing the work out of which they make
their money.Most of the employers in the building trade for instance
would be incapable of doing any skilled work.Very few of them would
be worth their salt as journeymen.The only work they do is to scheme
to reap the benefit of the labour of others.'The men who now become managers and foremen are selected not because
of their ability as craftsmen, but because they are good slave-drivers
and useful producers of profit for their employers.''How are you goin' to prevent the selfish and cunnin', as you call 'em,
from gettin' on top THEN as they do now?''The fact that all workers will receive the same pay, no matter what
class of work they are engaged in, or what their position, will ensure
our getting the very best man to do all the higher work and to organize
our business.''Yes: there will be such an enormous quantity of everything produced,
that their wages will enable everyone to purchase abundance of
everything they require.Even if some were paid more than others they
would not be able to spend it.There would be no need to save it, and
as there will be no starving poor, there will be no one to give it away
to.If it were possible to save and accumulate money it would bring
into being an idle class, living on their fellows: it would lead to the
downfall of our system, and a return to the same anarchy that exists at
present.Besides, if higher wages were paid to those engaged in the
higher work or occupying positions of authority it would prevent our
getting the best men.Unfit persons would try for the positions
because of the higher pay.Under the present
system men intrigue for and obtain or are pitchforked into positions
for which they have no natural ability at all; the only reason they
desire these positions is because of the salaries attached to them.These fellows get the money and the work is done by underpaid
subordinates whom the world never hears of.Under Socialism, this money
incentive will be done away with, and consequently the only men who
will try for these positions will be those who, being naturally fitted
for the work, would like to do it.For instance a man who is a born
organizer will not refuse to undertake such work because he will not be
paid more for it.Such a man will desire to do it and will esteem it a
privilege to be allowed to do it.To think out
all the details of some undertaking, to plan and scheme and organize,
is not work for a man like that.But for a man who
has sought and secured such a position, not because he liked the work,
but because he liked the salary--such work as this would be unpleasant
labour.Under Socialism the unfit man would not apply for that post but
would strive after some other for which he was fit and which he would
therefore desire and enjoy.There are some men who would rather have
charge of and organize and be responsible for work than do it with
their hands.There are others who would rather do delicate or
difficult or artistic work, than plain work.A man who is a born
artist would rather paint a frieze or a picture or carve a statue than
he would do plain work, or take charge of and direct the labour of
others.And there are another sort of men who would rather do ordinary
plain work than take charge, or attempt higher branches for which they
have neither liking or natural talent.'But there is one thing--a most important point that you seem to
entirely lose sight of, and that is, that all these different kinds and
classes are equal in one respect--THEY ARE ALL EQUALLY NECESSARY.Each
is a necessary and indispensable part of the whole; therefore everyone
who has done his full share of necessary work is justly entitled to a
full share of the results.The men who put the slates on are just as
indispensable as the men who lay the foundations.The work of the men
who build the walls and make the doors is just as necessary as the work
of the men who decorate the cornice.None of them would be of much use
without the architect, and the plans of the architect would come to
nothing, his building would be a mere castle in the air, if it were not
for the other workers.Each part of the work is equally necessary,
useful and indispensable if the building is to be perfected.Some of
these men work harder with their brains than with their hands and some
work harder with their hands than with their brains, BUT EACH ONE DOES
HIS FULL SHARE OF THE WORK.This truth will be recognized and acted
upon by those who build up and maintain the fabric of our Co-operative
Commonwealth.Every man who does his full share of the useful and
necessary work according to his abilities shall have his full share of
the total result.Herein will be its great difference from the present
system, under which it is possible for the cunning and selfish ones to
take advantage of the simplicity of others and rob them of part of the
fruits of their labour.As for those who will be engaged in the higher
branches, they will be sufficiently rewarded by being privileged to do
the work they are fitted for and enjoy.The only men and women who are
capable of good and great work of any kind are those who, being
naturally fit for it, love the work for its own sake and not for the
money it brings them.Under the present system, many men who have no
need of money produce great works, not for gain but for pleasure: their
wealth enables them to follow their natural inclinations.Under the
present system many men and women capable of great works are prevented
from giving expression to their powers by poverty and lack of
opportunity: they live in sorrow and die heartbroken, and the community
is the loser.These are the men and women who will be our artists,
sculptors, architects, engineers and captains of industry.'Under the present system there are men at the head of affairs whose
only object is the accumulation of money.Some of them possess great
abilities and the system has practically compelled them to employ those
abilities for their own selfish ends to the hurt of the community.Some of them have built up great fortunes out of the sweat and blood
and tears of men and women and little children.For those who delight
in such work as this, there will be no place in our Co-operative
Commonwealth.''If there won't be no extry pay and if anybody
will have all they need for just doing their part of the work, what
encouragement will there be for anyone to worry his brains out trying
to invent some new machine, or make some new discovery?''Well,' said Barrington, 'I think that's covered by the last answer,
but if it were found necessary--which is highly improbable--to offer
some material reward in addition to the respect, esteem or honour that
would be enjoyed by the author of an invention that was a boon to the
community, it could be arranged by allowing him to retire before the
expiration of his twenty-five years service.The boon he had conferred
on the community by the invention, would be considered equivalent to so
many years work.But a man like that would not desire to cease
working; that sort go on working all their lives, for love.He is one of the very few inventors who have made
money out of their work; he is a rich man, but the only use his wealth
seems to be to him is to procure himself facilities for going on with
his work; his life is a round of what some people would call painful
labour: but it is not painful labour to him; it's just pleasure, he
works for the love of it.Another way would be to absolve a man of
that sort from the necessity of ordinary work, so as to give him a
chance to get on with other inventions.It would be to the interests
of the community to encourage him in every way and to place materials
and facilities at his disposal.'But you must remember that even under the present system, Honour and
Praise are held to be greater than money.How many soldiers would
prefer money to the honour of wearing the intrinsically valueless
Victoria Cross?'Even now men think less of money than they do of the respect, esteem
or honour they are able to procure with it.Many men spend the greater
part of their lives striving to accumulate money, and when they have
succeeded, they proceed to spend it to obtain the respect of their
fellow-men.Some of them spend thousands of pounds for the honour of
being able to write "MP" after their names.Others
pay huge sums to gain admission to exclusive circles of society.Others give the money away in charity, or found libraries or
universities.The reason they do these things is that they desire to
be applauded and honoured by their fellow-men.'This desire is strongest in the most capable men--the men of genius.Therefore, under Socialism the principal incentive to great work will
be the same as now--Honour and Praise.But, under the present system,
Honour and Praise can be bought with money, and it does not matter much
how the money was obtained.The Cross of Honour and the
Laurel Crown will not be bought and sold for filthy lucre.They will
be the supreme rewards of Virtue and of Talent.''What would you do with them what spends all their money in drink?''I might reasonably ask you, "What's done with them or what you propose
to do with them now?"There are many men and women whose lives are so
full of toil and sorrow and the misery caused by abject poverty, who
are so shut out from all that makes life worth living, that the time
they spend in the public house is the only ray of sunshine in their
cheerless lives.Their mental and material poverty is so great that
they are deprived of and incapable of understanding the intellectual
and social pleasures of civilization...  Under Socialism there will be
no such class as this.Everyone will be educated, and social life and
rational pleasure will be within the reach of all.Therefore we do not
believe that there will be such a class.Any individuals who abandoned
themselves to such a course would be avoided by their fellows; but if
they became very degraded, we should still remember that they were our
brother men and women, and we should regard them as suffering from a
disease inherited from their uncivilized forefathers and try to cure
them by placing them under some restraint: in an institute for
instance.''Another good way to deal with 'em,' said Harlow, 'would be to allow
them double pay, so as they could drink themselves to death.We could
do without the likes of them.''Call the next case,' said Philpot.'This 'ere abundance that you're always talking about,' said Crass, you
can't be sure that it would be possible to produce all that.You're
only assoomin' that it could be done.'Barrington pointed to the still visible outlines of the 'Hoblong' that
Owen had drawn on the wall to illustrate a previous lecture.'Even under the present silly system of restricted production, with the
majority of the population engaged in useless, unproductive,
unnecessary work, and large numbers never doing any work at all, there
is enough produced to go all round after a fashion.More than enough,
for in consequence of what they call "Over-Production", the markets are
periodically glutted with commodities of all kinds, and then for a time
the factories are closed and production ceases.And yet we can all
manage to exist--after a fashion.This proves that if productive
industry were organized on the lines advocated by Socialists there
could be produced such a prodigious quantity of everything, that
everyone could live in plenty and comfort.The problem of how to
produce sufficient for all to enjoy abundance is already solved: the
problem that then remains is--How to get rid of those whose greed and
callous indifference to the sufferings of others, prevents it being
done.'and you'll never be able to get rid of 'em, mate,' cried Crass,
triumphantly--and the man with the copper wire stitches in his boot
said that it couldn't be done.'Well, we mean to have a good try, anyhow,' said Barrington.Crass and most of the others tried hard to think of something to say in
defence of the existing state of affairs, or against the proposals put
forward by the lecturer; but finding nothing, they maintained a sullen
and gloomy silence.The man with the copper wire stitches in his boot
in particular appeared to be very much upset; perhaps he was afraid
that if the things advocated by the speaker ever came to pass he would
not have any boots at all.To assume that he had some such thought as
this, is the only rational way to account for his hostility, for in his
case no change could have been for the worse unless it reduced him to
almost absolute nakedness and starvation.To judge by their unwillingness to consider any proposals to alter the
present system, one might have supposed that they were afraid of losing
something, instead of having nothing to lose--except their poverty.It was not till the chairman had made several urgent appeals for more
questions that Crass brightened up: a glad smile slowly spread over and
illuminated his greasy visage: he had at last thought of a most serious
and insurmountable obstacle to the establishment of the Co-operative
Commonwealth.'What,' he demanded, in a loud voice, 'what are you goin' to do, in
this 'ere Socialist Republic of yours, with them wot WON'T WORK'!'As Crass flung this bombshell into the Socialist camp, the miserable,
ragged-trousered crew around him could scarce forbear a cheer; but the
more intelligent part of the audience only laughed.'We don't believe that there will be any such people as that,' said
Barrington.'There's plenty of 'em about now, anyway,' sneered Crass.'You can't change 'uman nature, you know,' cried the man behind the
moat, and the one who had the copper wire stitches in his boot laughed
scornfully.'Yes, I know there are plenty such now,' rejoined Barrington.'It's
only what is to be expected, considering that practically all workers
live in poverty, and are regarded with contempt.The conditions under
which most of the work is done at present are so unpleasant and
degrading that everyone refuses to do any unless they are compelled;
none of us here, for instance, would continue to work for Rushton if it
were not for the fact that we have either to do so or starve; and when
we do work we only just earn enough to keep body and soul together.Under the present system everybody who can possibly manage to do so
avoids doing any work, the only difference being that some people do
their loafing better than others.The aristocracy are too lazy to
work, but they seem to get on all right; they have their tenants to
work for them.Rushton is too lazy to work, so he has arranged that we
and Nimrod shall work instead, and he fares much better than any of us
who do work.Then there is another kind of loafers who go about
begging and occasionally starving rather than submit to such abominable
conditions as are offered to them.These last are generally not much
worse off than we are and they are often better off.At present,
people have everything to gain and but little to lose by refusing to
work.Under Socialism it would be just the reverse; the conditions of
labour would be so pleasant, the hours of obligatory work so few, and
the reward so great, that it is absurd to imagine that any one would be
so foolish as to incur the contempt of his fellows and make himself a
social outcast by refusing to do the small share of work demanded of
him by the community of which he was a member.'As for what we should do to such individuals if there did happen to be
some, I can assure you that we would not treat them as you treat them
now.We would not dress them up in silk and satin and broadcloth and
fine linen: we would not embellish them, as you do, with jewels of gold
and jewels of silver and with precious stones; neither should we allow
them to fare sumptuously every day.Our method of dealing with them
would be quite different from yours.In the Co-operative Commonwealth
there will be no place for loafers; whether they call themselves
aristocrats or tramps, those who are too lazy to work shall have no
share in the things that are produced by the labour of others.If any man will not work, neither
shall he eat.Under the present system a man who is really too lazy to
work may stop you in the street and tell you that he cannot get
employment.For all you know, he may be telling the truth, and if you
have any feeling and are able, you will help him.But in the Socialist
State no one would have such an excuse, because everyone that was
willing would be welcome to come and help in the work of producing
wealth and happiness for all, and afterwards he would also be welcome
to his full share of the results.'inquired the chairman, breaking the gloomy
silence that followed.'I don't want anyone to think that I am blaming any of these
present-day loafers,' Barrington added.'The wealthy ones cannot be
expected voluntarily to come and work under existing conditions and if
they were to do so they would be doing more harm than good--they would
be doing some poor wretches out of employment.They are not to be
blamed; the people who are to blame are the working classes themselves,
who demand and vote for the continuance of the present system.As for
the other class of loafers--those at the bottom, the tramps and people
of that sort, if they were to become sober and industrious tomorrow,
they also would be doing more harm than good to the other workers; it
would increase the competition for work.If all the loafers in
Mugsborough could suddenly be transformed into decent house painters
next week, Nimrod might be able to cut down the wages another penny an
hour.I don't wish to speak disrespectfully of these tramps at all.Some of them are such simply because they would rather starve than
submit to the degrading conditions that we submit to, they do not see
the force of being bullied and chased, and driven about in order to
gain semi-starvation and rags.They are able to get those without
working; and I sometimes think that they are more worthy of respect and
are altogether a nobler type of beings than a lot of broken-spirited
wretches like ourselves, who are always at the mercy of our masters,
and always in dread of the sack.''Do you mean to say as the time will ever come when the gentry will mix
up on equal terms with the likes of us?'demanded the man behind the
moat, scornfully.When we get Socialism there won't be
any people like us.The man behind the moat did not seem very satisfied with this answer,
and told the others that he could not see anything to laugh at.'Now is your chance to
get some of your own back, but don't hall speak at once.''I should like to know who's goin' to do all the dirty work?''If everyone is to be allowed to choose 'is own trade, who'd be
fool enough to choose to be a scavenger, a sweep, a dustman or a sewer
man?nobody wouldn't want to do such jobs as them and everyone would be
after the soft jobs.''Of course,' cried Crass, eagerly clutching at this last straw.'The
thing sounds all right till you comes to look into it, but it wouldn't
never work!''It would be very easy to deal with any difficulty of that sort,'
replied Barrington, 'if it were found that too many people were
desirous of pursuing certain callings, it would be known that the
conditions attached to those kinds of work were unfairly easy, as
compared with other lines, so the conditions in those trades would be
made more severe.If we
found that too many persons wished to be doctors, architects, engineers
and so forth, we would increase the severity of the examinations.This
would scare away all but the most gifted and enthusiastic.We should
thus at one stroke reduce the number of applicants and secure the very
best men for the work--we should have better doctors, better
architects, better engineers than before.'As regards those disagreeable tasks for which there was a difficulty
in obtaining volunteers, we should adopt the opposite means.Suppose
that six hours was the general thing; and we found that we could not
get any sewer men; we should reduce the hours of labour in that
department to four, or if necessary to two, in order to compensate for
the disagreeable nature of the work.'Another way out of such difficulties would be to have a separate
division of the Industrial army to do all such work, and to make it
obligatory for every man to put in his first year of State service as a
member of this corps.Everyone
gets the benefit of such work; there would be no injustice in requiring
everyone to share.This would have the effect also of stimulating
invention; it would be to everyone's interest to think out means of
doing away with such kinds of work and there is no doubt that most of
it will be done by machinery in some way or other.A few years ago the
only way to light up the streets of a town was to go round to each
separate gas lamp and light each jet, one at a time: now, we press a
few buttons and light up the town with electricity.In the future we
shall probably be able to press a button and flush the sewers.''I suppose there won't be no
churches nor chapels; we shall all have to be atheists.''Everybody will be perfectly free to enjoy their own opinions and to
practise any religion they like; but no religion or sect will be
maintained by the State.If any congregation or body of people wish to
have a building for their own exclusive use as a church or chapel or
lecture hall it will be supplied to them by the State on the same terms
as those upon which dwelling houses will be supplied; the State will
construct the special kind of building and the congregation will have
to pay the rent, the amount to be based on the cost of construction, in
paper money of course.As far as the embellishment or decoration of
such places is concerned, there will of course be nothing to prevent
the members of the congregation if they wish from doing any such work
as that themselves in their own spare time of which they will have
plenty.''If everybody's got to do their share of work, where's the minister and
clergymen to come from?''There are at least three ways out of that difficulty.First,
ministers of religion could be drawn from the ranks of the
Veterans--men over forty-five years old who had completed their term of
State service.You must remember that these will not be worn out
wrecks, as too many of the working classes are at that age now.They
will have had good food and clothing and good general conditions all
their lives; and consequently they will be in the very prime of life.They will be younger than many of us now are at thirty; they will be
ideal men for the positions we are speaking of.All well educated in
their youth, and all will have had plenty of leisure for self culture
during the years of their State service and they will have the
additional recommendation that their congregation will not be required
to pay anything for their services.'Another way: If a congregation wished to retain the full-time services
of a young man whom they thought specially gifted but who had not
completed his term of State service, they could secure him by paying
the State for his services; thus the young man would still remain in
State employment, he would still continue to receive his pay from the
National Treasury, and at the age of forty-five would be entitled to
his pension like any other worker, and after that the congregation
would not have to pay the State anything.'A third--and as it seems to me, the most respectable way--would be for
the individual in question to act as minister or pastor or lecturer or
whatever it was, to the congregation without seeking to get out of
doing his share of the State service.The hours of obligatory work
would be so short and the work so light that he would have abundance of
leisure to prepare his orations without sponging on his
co-religionists.''Of course,' added Barrington, 'it would not only be congregations of
Christians who could adopt any of these methods.It is possible that a
congregation of agnostics, for instance, might want a separate building
or to maintain a lecturer.''What the 'ell's an agnostic?''An agnostic,' said the man behind the moat, 'is a bloke wot don't
believe nothing unless 'e see it with 'is own eyes.''All these details,' continued the speaker, 'of the organization of
affairs and the work of the Co-operative Commonwealth, are things which
do not concern us at all.They have merely been suggested by different
individuals as showing some ways in which these things could be
arranged.The exact methods to be adopted will be decided upon by the
opinion of the majority when the work is being done.Meantime, what we
have to do is to insist upon the duty of the State to provide
productive work for the unemployed, the State feeding of
schoolchildren, the nationalization or Socialization of Railways; Land;
the Trusts, and all public services that are still in the hands of
private companies.If you wish to see these things done, you must
cease from voting for Liberal and Tory sweaters, shareholders of
companies, lawyers, aristocrats, and capitalists; and you must fill the
House of Commons with Revolutionary Socialists.That is--with men who
are in favour of completely changing the present system.And in the
day that you do that, you will have solved the poverty "problem".No
more tramping the streets begging for a job!No more women and
children killing themselves with painful labour whilst strong men stand
idly by; but joyous work and joyous leisure for all.''Is it true,' said Easton, 'that Socialists intend to do away with the
Army and Navy?'Socialists believe in International Brotherhood and
peace.Nearly all wars are caused by profit-seeking capitalists,
seeking new fields for commercial exploitation, and by aristocrats who
make it the means of glorifying themselves in the eyes of the deluded
common people.You must remember that Socialism is not only a
national, but an international movement and when it is realized, there
will be no possibility of war, and we shall no longer need to maintain
an army and navy, or to waste a lot of labour building warships or
manufacturing arms and ammunition.All those people who are now
employed will then be at liberty to assist in the great work of
producing the benefits of civilization; creating wealth and knowledge
and happiness for themselves and others--Socialism means Peace on earth
and goodwill to all mankind.But in the meantime we know that the
people of other nations are not yet all Socialists; we do not forget
that in foreign countries--just the same as in Britain--there are large
numbers of profit seeking capitalists, who are so destitute of
humanity, that if they thought it could be done successfully and with
profit to themselves they would not scruple to come here to murder and
to rob.We do not forget that in foreign countries--the same as
here--there are plenty of so-called "Christian" bishops and priests
always ready to give their benediction to any such murderous projects,
and to blasphemously pray to the Supreme Being to help his children to
slay each other like wild beasts.And knowing and remembering all
this, we realize that until we have done away with capitalism,
aristocracy and anti-Christian clericalism, it is our duty to be
prepared to defend our homes and our native land.And therefore we are
in favour of maintaining national defensive forces in the highest
possible state of efficiency.But that does not mean that we are in
favour of the present system of organizing those forces.We do not
believe in conscription, and we do not believe that the nation should
continue to maintain a professional standing army to be used at home
for the purpose of butchering men and women of the working classes in
the interests of a handful of capitalists, as has been done at
Featherstone and Belfast; or to be used abroad to murder and rob the
people of other nations.Socialists advocate the establishment of a
National Citizen Army, for defensive purposes only.We believe that
every able bodied man should be compelled to belong to this force and
to undergo a course of military training, but without making him into a
professional soldier, or taking him away from civil life, depriving him
of the rights of citizenship or making him subject to military "law"
which is only another name for tyranny and despotism.This Citizen
Army could be organized on somewhat similar lines to the present
Territorial Force, with certain differences.For instance, we do not
believe--as our present rulers do--that wealth and aristocratic
influence are the two most essential qualifications for an efficient
officer; we believe that all ranks should be attainable by any man, no
matter how poor, who is capable of passing the necessary examinations,
and that there should be no expense attached to those positions which
the Government grant, or the pay, is not sufficient to cover.The
officers could be appointed in any one of several ways: They might be
elected by the men they would have to command, the only qualification
required being that they had passed their examinations, or they might
be appointed according to merit--the candidate obtaining the highest
number of marks at the examinations to have the first call on any
vacant post, and so on in order of merit.We believe in the total
abolition of courts martial, any offence against discipline should be
punishable by the ordinary civil law--no member of the Citizen Army
being deprived of the rights of a citizen.''Nobody wants to interfere with the Navy except to make its
organization more democratic--the same as that of the Citizen Army--and
to protect its members from tyranny by entitling them to be tried in a
civil court for any alleged offence.'It has been proved that if the soil of this country were
scientifically cultivated, it is capable of producing sufficient to
maintain a population of a hundred millions of people.Our present
population is only about forty millions, but so long as the land
remains in the possession of persons who refuse to allow it to be
cultivated we shall continue to be dependent on other countries for our
food supply.So long as we are in that position, and so long as
foreign countries are governed by Liberal and Tory capitalists, we
shall need the Navy to protect our overseas commerce from them.If we
had a Citizen Army such as I have mentioned, of nine or ten millions of
men and if the land of this country was properly cultivated, we should
be invincible at home.No foreign power would ever be mad enough to
attempt to land their forces on our shores.But they would now be able
to starve us all to death in a month if it were not for the Navy.It's
a sensible and creditable position, isn't it?''Even in times of peace, thousands of people standing idle and tamely
starving in their own fertile country, because a few land "Lords"
forbid them to cultivate it.'demanded Philpot, breaking a prolonged
silence.'Would any Liberal or Tory capitalist like to get up into the pulpit
and oppose the speaker?'the chairman went on, finding that no one
responded to his appeal for questions.'As there's no more questions and no one won't get up into the pulpit,
it is now my painful duty to call upon someone to move a resolution.''Well, Mr Chairman,' said Harlow, 'I may say that when I came on this
firm I was a Liberal, but through listenin' to several lectures by
Professor Owen and attendin' the meetings on the hill at Windley and
reading the books and pamphlets I bought there and from Owen, I came to
the conclusion some time ago that it's a mug's game for us to vote for
capitalists whether they calls theirselves Liberals or Tories.They're
all alike when you're workin' for 'em; I defy any man to say what's the
difference between a Liberal and a Tory employer.There is none--there
can't be; they're both sweaters, and they've got to be, or they
wouldn't be able to compete with each other.And since that's what
they are, I say it's a mug's game for us to vote 'em into Parliament to
rule over us and to make laws that we've got to abide by whether we
like it or not.There's nothing to choose between 'em, and the proof of
it is that it's never made much difference to us which party was in or
which was out.It's quite true that in the past both of 'em have
passed good laws, but they've only done it when public opinion was so
strong in favour of it that they knew there was no getting out of it,
and then it was a toss up which side did it.'That's the way I've been lookin' at things lately, and I'd almost made
up my mind never to vote no more, or to trouble myself about politics
at all, because although I could see there was no sense in voting for
Liberal or Tory capitalists, at the same time I must admit I couldn't
make out how Socialism was going to help us.But the explanation of it
which Professor Barrington has given us this afternoon has been a bit
of an eye opener for me, and with your permission I should like to move
as a resolution, "That it is the opinion of this meeting that Socialism
is the only remedy for Unemployment and Poverty."'The conclusion of Harlow's address was greeted with loud cheers from
the Socialists, but most of the Liberal and Tory supporters of the
present system maintained a sulky silence.'I'll second that resolution,' said Easton.'And I'll lay a bob both ways,' remarked Bundy.The resolution was
then put, and though the majority were against it, the Chairman
declared it was carried unanimously.By this time the violence of the storm had in a great measure abated,
but as rain was still falling it was decided not to attempt to resume
work that day.Besides, it would have been too late, even if the
weather had cleared up.'P'raps it's just as well it 'as rained,' remarked one man.'If it
'adn't some of us might 'ave got the sack tonight.As it is, there'll
be hardly enough for all of us to do tomorrer and Saturday mornin' even
if it is fine.'This was true: nearly all the outside was finished, and what remained
to be done was ready for the final coat.Inside all there was to do
was to colour wash the walls and to give the woodwork of the kitchen
and scullery the last coat of paint.It was inevitable--unless the firm had some other work for them to do
somewhere else--that there would be a great slaughter on Saturday.'Now,' said Philpot, assuming what he meant to be the manner of a
school teacher addressing children, 'I wants you hall to make a
speshall heffort and get 'ere very early in the mornin'--say about four
o'clock--and them wot doos the most work tomorrer, will get a prize on
Saturday.''Yes,' replied Philpot, 'and not honly will you get a prize for good
conduck tomorrer, but if you all keep on workin' like we've bin doing
lately till you're too hold and wore hout to do any more, you'll be
allowed to go to a nice workhouse for the rest of your lives!and each
one of you will be given a title--"Pauper!"'Although the majority of them had mothers or fathers or other near
relatives who had already succeeded to the title--they laughed!As they were going home, Crass paused at the gate, and pointing up to
the large gable at the end of the house, he said to Philpot:

'You'll want the longest ladder--the 65, for that, tomorrow.'Chapter 46

The 'Sixty-five'


The next morning after breakfast, Philpot, Sawkins, Harlow and
Barrington went to the Yard to get the long ladder--the 65--so called
because it had sixty-five rungs.It was really what is known as a
builder's scaffold ladder, and it had been strengthened by several iron
bolts or rods which passed through just under some of the rungs.One
side of the ladder had an iron band or ribbon twisted and nailed round
it spirally.It was not at all suitable for painters' work, being
altogether too heavy and cumbrous.However, as none of the others were
long enough to reach the high gable at the Refuge, they managed, with a
struggle, to get it down from the hooks and put it on one of the
handcarts and soon passed through the streets of mean and dingy houses
in the vicinity of the yard, and began the ascent of the long hill.There had been a lot of rain during the night, and the sky was still
overcast with dark grey clouds.The cart went heavily over the muddy
road; Sawkins was at the helm, holding the end of the ladder and
steering; the others walked a little further ahead, at the sides of the
cart.It was such hard work that by the time they were half-way up the hill
they were so exhausted and out of breath that they had to stop for a
rest.'This is a bit of all right, ain't it?'remarked Harlow as he took off
his cap and wiped the sweat from his forehead with his handkerchief.While they rested they kept a good look out for Rushton or Hunter, who
were likely to pass by at any moment.At first, no one made any reply to Harlow's observation, for they were
all out of breath and Philpot's lean fingers trembled violently as he
wiped the perspiration from his face.'Yes, mate,' he said despondently, after a while.'It's one way of
gettin' a livin' and there's plenty better ways.'In addition to the fact that his rheumatism was exceptionally bad, he
felt unusually low-spirited this morning; the gloomy weather and the
prospect of a long day of ladder work probably had something to do with
it.'A "living" is right,' said Barrington bitterly.He also was exhausted
with the struggle up the hill and enraged by the woebegone appearance
of poor old Philpot, who was panting and quivering from the exertion.The unaccountable depression that
possessed Philpot deprived him of all his usual jocularity and filled
him with melancholy thoughts.He had travelled up and down this hill a
great many times before under similar circumstances and he said to
himself that if he had half a quid now for every time he had pushed a
cart up this road, he wouldn't need to do anyone out of a job all the
rest of his life.The shop where he had been apprenticed used to be just down at the
bottom; the place had been pulled down years ago, and the ground was
now occupied by more pretentious buildings.Not quite so far down the
road--on the other side--he could see the church where he used to
attend Sunday School when he was a boy, and where he was married just
thirty years ago.Presently--when they reached the top of the hill--he
would be able to look across the valley and see the spire of the other
church, the one in the graveyard, where all those who were dear to him
had been one by one laid to rest.He felt that he would not be sorry
when the time came to join them there.Possibly, in the next world--if
there were such a place--they might all be together once more.He was suddenly aroused from these thoughts by an exclamation from
Harlow.Rushton was coming up the hill
in his dog-cart with Grinder sitting by his side.They passed so
closely that Philpot--who was on that side of the cart--was splashed
with mud from the wheels of the trap.'Them's some of your chaps, ain't they?''We're doing a job up this way.''I should 'ave thought it would pay you better to use a 'orse for sich
work as that,' said Grinder.'We do use the horses whenever it's necessary for very big loads, you
know,' answered Rushton, and added with a laugh: 'But the donkeys are
quite strong enough for such a job as that.'The 'donkeys' struggled on up the hill for about another hundred yards
and then they were forced to halt again.'We mustn't stop long, you know,' said Harlow.'Most likely he's gone
to the job, and he'll wait to see how long it takes us to get there.'Barrington felt inclined to say that in that case Rushton would have to
wait, but he remained silent, for he remembered that although he
personally did not care a brass button whether he got the sack or not,
the others were not so fortunately circumstanced.While they were resting, another two-legged donkey passed by pushing
another cart--or rather, holding it back, for he was coming slowly down
the hill.Another Heir of all the ages--another Imperialist--a
degraded, brutalized wretch, clad in filthy, stinking rags, his toes
protruding from the rotten broken boots that were tied with bits of
string upon his stockingless feet.The ramshackle cart was loaded with
empty bottles and putrid rags, heaped loosely in the cart and packed
into a large sack.Old coats and trousers, dresses, petticoats, and
under-clothing, greasy, mildewed and malodorous.As he crept along
with his eyes on the ground, the man gave utterance at intervals to
uncouth, inarticulate sounds.'That's another way of gettin' a livin',' said Sawkins with a laugh as
the miserable creature slunk past.Harlow also laughed, and Barrington regarded them curiously.He
thought it strange that they did not seem to realize that they might
some day become like this man themselves.'I've often wondered what they does with all them dirty old rags,' said
Philpot.'Made into paper,' replied Harlow, briefly.'Some of them are,' said Barrington, 'and some are manufactured into
shoddy cloth and made into Sunday clothes for working men.'There's all sorts of different ways of gettin' a livin',' remarked
Sawkins, after a pause.'I read in a paper the other day about a bloke
wot goes about lookin' for open trap doors and cellar flaps in front of
shops.As soon as he spotted one open, he used to go and fall down in
it; and then he'd be took to the 'orspital, and when he got better he
used to go and threaten to bring a action against the shop-keeper and
get damages, and most of 'em used to part up without goin' in front of
the judge at all.But one day a slop was a watchin' of 'im, and seen
'im chuck 'isself down one, and when they picked 'im up they found he'd
broke his leg.So they took 'im to the 'orspital and when he came out
and went round to the shop and started talkin' about bringin' a action
for damages, the slop collared 'im and they give 'im six months.''Yes, I read about that,' said Harlow, 'and there was another case of a
chap who was run over by a motor, and they tried to make out as 'e put
'isself in the way on purpose; but 'e got some money out of the swell
it belonged to; a 'undered pound I think it was.''I only wish as one of their motors would run inter me,' said Philpot,
making a feeble attempt at a joke.'I lay I'd get some a' me own back
out of 'em.'The others laughed, and Harlow was about to make some reply but at that
moment a cyclist appeared coming down the hill from the direction of
the job.It was Nimrod, so they resumed their journey once more and
presently Hunter shot past on his machine without taking any notice of
them...

When they arrived they found that Rushton had not been there at all,
but Nimrod had.Crass said that he had kicked up no end of a row
because they had not called at the yard at six o'clock that morning for
the ladder, instead of going for it after breakfast--making two
journeys instead of one, and he had also been ratty because the big
gable had not been started the first thing that morning.They carried the ladder into the garden and laid it on the ground along
the side of the house where the gable was.A brick wall about eight
feet high separated the grounds of 'The Refuge' from those of the
premises next door.Between this wall and the side wall of the house
was a space about six feet wide and this space formed a kind of alley
or lane or passage along the side of the house.They laid the ladder
on the ground along this passage, the 'foot' was placed about half-way
through; just under the centre of the gable, and as it lay there, the
other end of the ladder reached right out to the front railings.Next, it was necessary that two men should go up into the attic--the
window of which was just under the point of the gable--and drop the end
of a long rope down to the others who would tie it to the top of the
ladder.Then two men would stand on the bottom rung, so as to keep the
'foot' down, and the three others would have to raise the ladder up,
while the two men up in the attic hauled on the rope.They called Bundy and his mate Ned Dawson to help, and it was arranged
that Harlow and Crass should stand on the foot because they were the
heaviest.Philpot, Bundy, and Barrington were to 'raise', and Dawson
and Sawkins were to go up to the attic and haul on the rope.None of them had thought of bringing
one from the yard.'Why, ain't there one 'ere?''Do you
mean to say as you ain't brought one, then?'Philpot stammered out something about having thought there was one at
the house already, and the others said they had not thought about it at
all.'Well, what the bloody hell are we to do now?''I'll go to the yard and get one,' suggested Barrington.'I can do it
in twenty minutes there and back.'and a bloody fine row there'd be if Hunter was to see you!'Ere
it's nearly ten o'clock and we ain't made a start on this gable wot we
ought to 'ave started first thing this morning.''Couldn't we tie two or three of those short ropes together?''Those that the other two ladders was spliced with?'As there was sure to be a row if they delayed long enough to send to
the yard, it was decided to act on Philpot's suggestion.Several of the short ropes were accordingly tied together but upon
examination it was found that some parts were so weak that even Crass
had to admit it would be dangerous to attempt to haul the heavy ladder
up with them.'Well, the only thing as I can see for it,' he said, 'is that the boy
will 'ave to go down to the yard and get the long rope.It won't do
for anyone else to go: there's been one row already about the waste of
time because we didn't call at the yard for the ladder at six o'clock.'Bert was down in the basement of the house limewashing a cellar.Crass
called him up and gave him the necessary instructions, chief of which
was to get back again as soon as ever he could.The boy ran off, and
while they were waiting for him to come back the others went on with
their several jobs.Philpot returned to the small gable he had been
painting before breakfast, which he had not quite finished.As he
worked a sudden and unaccountable terror took possession of him.He did
not want to do that other gable; he felt too ill; and he almost
resolved that he would ask Crass if he would mind letting him do
something else.There were several younger men who would not object to
doing it--it would be mere child's play to them, and Barrington had
already--yesterday--offered to change jobs with him.But then, when he thought of what the probable consequences would be,
he hesitated to take that course, and tried to persuade himself that he
would be able to get through with the work all right.He did not want
Crass or Hunter to mark him as being too old for ladder work.Bert came back in about half an hour flushed and sweating with the
weight of the rope and with the speed he had made.He delivered it to
Crass and then returned to his cellar and went on with the limewashing,
while Crass passed the word for Philpot and the others to come and
raise the ladder.He handed the rope to Ned Dawson, who took it up to
the attic, accompanied by Sawkins; arrived there they lowered one end
out of the window down to the others.'If you ask me,' said Ned Dawson, who was critically examining the
strands of the rope as he passed it out through the open window, 'If
you ask me, I don't see as this is much better than the one we made up
by tyin' the short pieces together.Look 'ere,'--he indicated a part
of the rope that was very frayed and worn--'and 'ere's another place
just as bad.''Well, for Christ's sake don't say nothing about it now,' replied
Sawkins.'There's been enough talk and waste of time over this job
already.'Ned made no answer and the end having by this time reached the ground,
Bundy made it fast to the ladder, about six rungs from the top.The ladder was lying on the ground, parallel to the side of the house.The task of raising it would have been much easier if they had been
able to lay it at right angles to the house wall, but this was
impossible because of the premises next door and the garden wall
between the two houses.On account of its having to be raised in this
manner the men at the top would not be able to get a straight pull on
the rope; they would have to stand back in the room without being able
to see the ladder, and the rope would have to be drawn round the corner
of the window, rasping against the edge of the stone sill and the
brickwork.The end of the rope having been made fast to the top of the ladder,
Crass and Harlow stood on the foot and the other three raised the top
from the ground; as Barrington was the tallest, he took the middle
position--underneath the ladder--grasping the rungs, Philpot being on
his left and Bundy on his right, each holding one side of the ladder.At a signal from Crass, Dawson and Sawkins began to haul on the rope,
and the top of the ladder began to rise slowly into the air.Philpot was not of much use at this work, which made it all the harder
for the other two who were lifting, besides putting an extra strain on
the rope.His lack of strength, and the efforts of Barrington and
Bundy to make up for him caused the ladder to sway from side to side,
as it would not have done if they had all been equally capable.Meanwhile, upstairs, Dawson and Sawkins--although the ladder was as yet
only a little more than half the way up--noticed, as they hauled and
strained on the rope, that it had worn a groove for itself in the
corner of the brickwork at the side of the window; and every now and
then, although they pulled with all their strength, they were not able
to draw in any part of the rope at all; and it seemed to them as if
those others down below must have let go their hold altogether, or
ceased lifting.The three men found the weight so
overpowering, that once or twice they were compelled to relax their
efforts for a few seconds, and at those times the rope had to carry the
whole weight of the ladder; and the part of the rope that had to bear
the greatest strain was the part that chanced to be at the angle of the
brickwork at the side of the window.And presently it happened that
one of the frayed and worn places that Dawson had remarked about was
just at the angle during one of those momentary pauses.On one end
there hung the ponderous ladder, straining the frayed rope against the
corner of the brickwork and the sharp edge of the stone sill, at the
other end were Dawson and Sawkins pulling with all their strength, and
in that instant the rope snapped like a piece of thread.One end
remained in the hands of Sawkins and Dawson, who reeled backwards into
the room, and the other end flew up into the air, writhing like the
lash of a gigantic whip.For a moment the heavy ladder swayed from
side to side: Barrington, standing underneath, with his hands raised
above his head grasping one of the rungs, struggled desperately to hold
it up.At his right stood Bundy, also with arms upraised holding the
side; and on the left, between the ladder and the wall, was Philpot.For a brief space they strove fiercely to support the overpowering
weight, but Philpot had no strength, and the ladder, swaying over to
the left, crashed down, crushing him upon the ground and against the
wall of the house.He fell face downwards, with the ladder across his
shoulders; the side that had the iron bands twisted round it fell
across the back of his neck, forcing his face against the bricks at the
base of the wall.He uttered no cry and was quite still, with blood
streaming from the cuts on his face and trickling from his ears.Barrington was also hurled to the ground with his head and arms under
the ladder; his head and face were cut and bleeding and he was
unconscious; none of the others was hurt, for they had all had time to
jump clear when the ladder fell.Their shouts soon brought all the
other men running to the spot, and the ladder was quickly lifted off
the two motionless figures.At first it seemed that Philpot was dead,
but Easton rushed off for a neighbouring doctor, who came in a few
minutes.He knelt down and carefully examined the crushed and motionless form of
Philpot, while the other men stood by in terrified silence.Barrington, who fortunately was but momentarily stunned was sitting
against the wall and had suffered nothing more serious than minor cuts
and bruises.The doctor's examination of Philpot was a very brief one, and when he
rose from his knees, even before he spoke they knew from his manner
that their worst fears were realized.Chapter 47

The Ghouls


Barrington did not do any more work that day, but before going home he
went to the doctor's house and the latter dressed the cuts on his head
and arms.Philpot's body was taken away on the ambulance to the
mortuary.Hunter arrived at the house shortly afterwards and at once began to
shout and bully because the painting of the gable was not yet
commenced.When he heard of the accident he blamed them for using the
rope, and said they should have asked for a new one.Before he went
away he had a long, private conversation with Crass, who told him that
Philpot had no relatives and that his life was insured for ten pounds
in a society of which Crass was also a member.He knew that Philpot
had arranged that in the event of his death the money was to be paid to
the old woman with whom he lodged, who was a very close friend.The
result of this confidential talk was that Crass and Hunter came to the
conclusion that it was probable that she would be very glad to be
relieved of the trouble of attending to the business of the funeral,
and that Crass, as a close friend of the dead man, and a fellow member
of the society, was the most suitable person to take charge of the
business for her.He was already slightly acquainted with the old
lady, so he would go to see her at once and get her authority to act on
her behalf.Of course, they would not be able to do much until after
the inquest, but they could get the coffin made--as Hunter knew the
mortuary keeper there would be no difficulty about getting in for a
minute to measure the corpse.This matter having been arranged, Hunter departed to order a new rope,
and shortly afterwards Crass--having made sure that everyone would have
plenty to do while he was gone--quietly slipped away to go to see
Philpot's landlady.He went off so secretly that the men did not know
that he had been away at all until they saw him come back just before
twelve o'clock.The new rope was brought to the house about one o'clock and this time
the ladder was raised without any mishap.Harlow was put on to paint
the gable, and he felt so nervous that he was allowed to have Sawkins
to stand by and hold the ladder all the time.Everyone felt nervous
that afternoon, and they all went about their work in an unusually
careful manner.When Bert had finished limewashing the cellar, Crass set him to work
outside, painting the gate of the side entrance.While the boy was
thus occupied he was accosted by a solemn-looking man who asked him
about the accident.The solemn stranger was very sympathetic and
inquired what was the name of the man who had been killed, and whether
he was married.Bert informed him that Philpot was a widower, and that
he had no children.'Ah, well, that's so much the better, isn't it?'said the stranger
shaking his head mournfully.'It's a dreadful thing, you know, when
there's children left unprovided for.You don't happen to know where
he lived, do you?''Yes,' said Bert, mentioning the address and beginning to wonder what
the solemn man wanted to know for, and why he appeared to be so sorry
for Philpot since it was quite evident that he had never known him.'Thanks very much,' said the man, pulling out his pocket-book and
making a note of it.'Good afternoon, sir,' said Bert and he turned to resume his work.Crass came along the garden just as the mysterious stranger was
disappearing round the corner.said Crass, who had seen the man talking to Bert.'I don't know exactly; he was asking about the accident, and whether
Joe left any children, and where he lived.He must be a very decent
sort of chap, I should think.'Don't
you know who he is?''No,' replied the boy; 'but I thought p'raps he was a reporter of some
paper.''E ain't no reporter: that's old Snatchum the undertaker.'E's
smellin' round after a job; but 'e's out of it this time, smart as 'e
thinks 'e is.'Barrington came back the next morning to work, and at breakfast-time
there was a lot of talk about the accident.They said that it was all
very well for Hunter to talk like that about the rope, but he had known
for a long time that it was nearly worn out.Newman said that only
about three weeks previously when they were raising a ladder at another
job he had shown the rope to him, and Misery had replied that there was
nothing wrong with it.Several others besides Newman claimed to have
mentioned the matter to Hunter, and each of them said he had received
the same sort of reply.But when Barrington suggested that they should
attend the inquest and give evidence to that effect, they all became
suddenly silent and in a conversation Barrington afterwards had with
Newman the latter pointed out that if he were to do so, it would do no
good to Philpot.It would not bring him back but it would be sure to
do himself a lot of harm.He would never get another job at Rushton's
and probably many of the other employers would'mark him' as well.'So if YOU say anything about it,' concluded Newman, 'don't bring my
name into it.'Barrington was constrained to admit that all things considered it was
right for Newman to mind his own business.He felt that it would not
be fair to urge him or anyone else to do or say anything that would
injure themselves.Misery came to the house about eleven o'clock and informed several of
the hands that as work was very slack they would get their back day at
pay time.He said that the firm had tendered for one or two jobs, so
they could call round about Wednesday and perhaps he might then be able
to give some of them another start, Barrington was not one of those who
were'stood off', although he had expected to be on account of the
speech he had made at the Beano, and everyone said that he would have
got the push sure enough if it had not been for the accident.Before he went away, Nimrod instructed Owen and Crass to go to the yard
at once: they would there find Payne the carpenter, who was making
Philpot's coffin, which would be ready for Crass to varnish by the time
they got there.Misery told Owen that he had left the coffin plate and the instructions
with Payne and added that he was not to take too much time over the
writing, because it was a very cheap job.When they arrived at the yard, Payne was just finishing the coffin,
which was of elm.All that remained to be done to it was the pitching
of the joints inside and Payne was in the act of lifting the pot of
boiling pitch off the fire to do this.As it was such a cheap job, there was no time to polish it properly, so
Crass proceeded to give it a couple of coats of spirit varnish, and
while he was doing this Owen wrote the plate, which was made of very
thin zinc lacquered over to make it look like brass:

                                JOSEPH PHILPOT
                                     Died
                              September 1st 19--
                                Aged 56 years.The inquest was held on the following Monday morning, and as both
Rushton and Hunter thought it possible that Barrington might attempt to
impute some blame to them, they had worked the oracle and had contrived
to have several friends of their own put on the jury.There was,
however, no need for their alarm, because Barrington could not say that
he had himself noticed, or called Hunter's attention to the state of
the rope; and he did not wish to mention the names of the others
without their permission.The evidence of Crass and the other men who
were called was to the effect that it was a pure accident.None of them
had noticed that the rope was unsound.Hunter also swore that he did
not know of it--none of the men had ever called his attention to it; if
they had done so he would have procured a new one immediately.Philpot's landlady and Mr Rushton were also called as witnesses, and
the end was that the jury returned a verdict of accidental death, and
added that they did not think any blame attached to anyone.The coroner discharged the jury, and as they and the witnesses passed
out of the room, Hunter followed Rushton outside, with the hope of
being honoured by a little conversation with him on the satisfactory
issue of the case; but Rushton went off without taking any notice of
him, so Hunter returned to the room where the court had been held to
get the coroner's certificate authorizing the interment of the body.This document is usually handed to the friends of the deceased or to
the undertaker acting for them.When Hunter got back to the room he
found that during his absence the coroner had given it to Philpot's
landlady, who had taken it with her.He accordingly hastened outside
again to ask her for it, but the woman was nowhere to be seen.Crass and the other men were also gone; they had hurried off to return
to work, and after a moment's hesitation Hunter decided that it did not
matter much about the certificate.Crass had arranged the business
with the landlady and he could get the paper from her later on.Having
come to this conclusion, he dismissed the subject from his mind: he had
several prices to work out that afternoon--estimates from some jobs the
firm was going to tender for.That evening, after having been home to tea, Crass and Sawkins met by
appointment at the carpenter's shop to take the coffin to the mortuary,
where Misery had arranged to meet them at half past eight o'clock.Hunter's plan was to have the funeral take place from the mortuary,
which was only about a quarter of an hour's walk from the yard; so
tonight they were just going to lift in the body and get the lid
screwed down.It was blowing hard and raining heavily when Crass and Sawkins set out,
carrying the coffin--covered with a black cloth--on their shoulders.They also took a small pair of tressels for the coffin to stand on.Crass carried one of these slung over his arm and Sawkins the other.On their way they had to pass the 'Cricketers' and the place looked so
inviting that they decided to stop and have a drink--just to keep the
damp out, and as they could not very well take the coffin inside with
them, they stood it up against the brick wall a little way from the
side of the door: as Crass remarked with a laugh, there was not much
danger of anyone pinching it.The Old Dear served them and just as
they finished drinking the two half-pints there was a loud crash
outside and Crass and Sawkins rushed out and found that the coffin had
blown down and was lying bottom upwards across the pavement, while the
black cloth that had been wrapped round it was out in the middle of the
muddy road.Having recovered this, they shook as much of the dirt off
as they could, and having wrapped it round the coffin again they
resumed their journey to the mortuary, where they found Hunter waiting
for them, engaged in earnest conversation with the keeper.The
electric light was switched on, and as Crass and Sawkins came in they
saw that the marble slab was empty.'Snatchum came this afternoon with a hand-truck and a corfin,'
explained the keeper.'I was out at the time, and the missis thought
it was all right so she let him have the key.'Hunter and Crass looked blankly at each other.'Well, this takes the biskit!'said the latter as soon as he could
speak.'I thought you said you had settled everything all right with the old
woman?''I seen 'er on Friday, and I told 'er to
leave it all to me to attend to, and she said she would.I told 'er
that Philpot said to me that if ever anything 'appened to 'im I was to
take charge of everything for 'er, because I was 'is best friend.And
I told 'er we'd do it as cheap as possible.''Well, it seems to me as you've bungled it somehow,' said Nimrod,
gloomily.'I ought to have gone and seen 'er myself, I was afraid
you'd make a mess of it,' he added in a wailing tone.'It's always the
same; everything that I don't attend to myself goes wrong.'Crass thought that the principal piece
of bungling in this affair was Hunter's failure to secure possession of
the Coroner's certificate after the inquest, but he was afraid to say
so.Outside, the rain was still falling and drove in through the partly
open door, causing the atmosphere of the mortuary to be even more than
usually cold and damp.The empty coffin had been reared against one of
the walls and the marble slab was still stained with blood, for the
keeper had not had time to clean it since the body had been removed.'I can see 'ow it's been worked,' said Crass at last.'There's one of
the members of the club who works for Snatchum, and 'e's took it on
'isself to give the order for the funeral; but 'e's got no right to do
it.''Right or no right, 'e's done it,' replied Misery,'so you'd better
take the box back to the shop.'Crass and Sawkins accordingly returned to the workshop, where they were
presently joined by Nimrod.'I've been thinking this business over as I came along,' he said, 'and
I don't see being beat like this by Snatchum; so you two can just put
the tressels and the box on a hand cart and we'll take it over to
Philpot's house.'Nimrod walked on the pavement while the other two pushed the cart, and
it was about half past nine, when they arrived at the street in Windley
where Philpot used to live.They halted in a dark part of the street a
few yards away from the house and on the opposite side.'I think the best thing we can do,' said Misery, 'is for me and Sawkins
to wait 'ere while you go to the 'ouse and see 'ow the land lies.You've done all the business with 'er so far.It's no use takin' the
box unless we know the corpse is there; for all we know, Snatchum may
'ave taken it 'ome with 'im.''Yes; I think that'll be the best way,' agreed Crass, after a moment's
thought.Nimrod and Sawkins accordingly took shelter in the doorway of an empty
house, leaving the handcart at the kerb, while Crass went across the
street and knocked at Philpot's door.They saw it opened by an elderly
woman holding a lighted candle in her hand; then Crass went inside and
the door was shut.In about a quarter of an hour he reappeared and,
leaving the door partly open behind him, he came out and crossed over
to where the others were waiting.As he drew near they could see that
he carried a piece of paper in his hand.'It's all right,' he said in a hoarse whisper as he came up.Misery took the paper eagerly and scanned it by the light of a match
that Crass struck.It was the certificate right enough, and with a
sigh of relief Hunter put it into his note-book and stowed it safely
away in the inner pocket of his coat, while Crass explained the result
of his errand.It appeared that the other member of the Society, accompanied by
Snatchum, had called upon the old woman and had bluffed her into giving
them the order for the funeral.It was they who had put her up to
getting the certificate from the Coroner--they had been careful to keep
away from the inquest themselves so as not to arouse Hunter's or
Crass's suspicions.'When they brought the body 'ome this afternoon,' Crass went on,
'Snatchum tried to get the stifficut orf 'er, but she'd been thinkin'
things over and she was a bit frightened 'cos she knowed she'd made
arrangements with me, and she thought she'd better see me first; so she
told 'im she'd give it to 'im on Thursday; that's the day as 'e was
goin' to 'ave the funeral.''He'll find he's a day too late,' said Misery, with a ghastly grin.'We'll get the job done on Wednesday.''She didn't want to give it to me, at first,' Crass concluded, 'but I
told 'er we'd see 'er right if old Snatchum tried to make 'er pay for
the other coffin.''I don't think he's likely to make much fuss about it,' said Hunter.'He won't want everybody to know he was so anxious for the job.'Crass and Sawkins pushed the handcart over to the other side of the
road and then, lifting the coffin off, they carried it into the house,
Nimrod going first.The old woman was waiting for them with the candle at the end of the
passage.'I shall be very glad when it's all over,' she said, as she led the way
up the narrow stairs, closely followed by Hunter, who carried the
tressels, Crass and Sawkins, bringing up the rear with the coffin.'I
shall be very glad when it's all over, for I'm sick and tired of
answerin' the door to undertakers.If there's been one 'ere since
Friday there's been a dozen, all after the job, not to mention all the
cards what's been put under the door, besides the one's what I've had
give to me by different people.I had a pair of boots bein' mended and
the man took the trouble to bring 'em 'ome when they was finished--a
thing 'e's never done before--just for an excuse to give me an
undertaker's card.'Then the milkman brought one, and so did the baker, and the
greengrocer give me another when I went in there on Saturday to buy
some vegetables for Sunday dinner.'Arrived at the top landing the old woman opened a door and entered a
small and wretchedly furnished room.Across the lower sash of the window hung a tattered piece of lace
curtain.The low ceiling was cracked and discoloured.There was a rickety little wooden washstand, and along one side of the
room a narrow bed covered with a ragged grey quilt, on which lay a
bundle containing the clothes that the dead man was wearing at the time
of the accident.There was a little table in front of the window, with a small
looking-glass upon it, and a cane-seated chair was placed by the
bedside and the floor was covered with a faded piece of drab-
carpet of no perceptible pattern, worn into holes in several places.In the middle of this dreary room, upon a pair of tressels, was the
coffin containing Philpot's body.Seen by the dim and flickering light
of the candle, the aspect of this coffin, covered over with a white
sheet, was terrible in its silent, pathetic solitude.Hunter placed the pair of tressels he had been carrying against the
wall, and the other two put the empty coffin on the floor by the side
of the bed.The old woman stood the candlestick on the mantelpiece,
and withdrew, remarking that they would not need her assistance.The
three men then removed their overcoats and laid them on the end of the
bed, and from the pocket of his Crass took out two large screwdrivers,
one of which he handed to Hunter.Sawkins held the candle while they
unscrewed and took off the lid of the coffin they had brought with
them: it was not quite empty, for they had brought a bag of tools
inside it.'I think we shall be able to work better if we takes the other one orf
the trussels and puts it on the floor,' remarked Crass.'Yes, I think so, too,' replied Hunter.Crass took off the sheet and threw it on the bed, revealing the other
coffin, which was very similar in appearance to the one they had
brought with them, being of elms, with the usual imitation brass
furniture.Hunter took hold of the head and Crass the foot and they
lifted it off the tressels on to the floor.''E's not very 'eavy; that's one good thing,' observed Hunter.''E always was a very thin chap,' replied Crass.The screws that held down the lid had been covered over with
large-headed brass nails which had to be wrenched off before they could
get at the screws, of which there were eight altogether.It was
evident from the appearance of the beads of these screws that they were
old ones that had been used for some purpose before: they were rusty
and of different sizes, some being rather larger or smaller, than they
should have been.They were screwed in so firmly that by the time they
had drawn half of them out the two men were streaming with
perspiration.After a while Hunter took the candle from Sawkins and
the latter had a try at the screws.'Anyone would think the dam' things had been there for a 'undred
years,' remarked Hunter, savagely, as he wiped the sweat from his face
and neck with his handkerchief.Kneeling on the lid of the coffin and panting and grunting with the
exertion, the other two continued to struggle with their task.Suddenly
Crass uttered an obscene curse; he had broken off one side of the head
of the screw he was trying to turn and almost at the same instant a
similar misfortune happened to Sawkins.After this, Hunter again took a screwdriver himself, and when they got
all the screws out with the exception of the two broken ones, Crass
took a hammer and chisel out of the bag and proceeded to cut off what
was left of the tops of the two that remained.But even after this was
done the two screws still held the lid on the coffin, and so they had
to hammer the end of the blade of the chisel underneath and lever the
lid up so that they could get hold of it with their fingers.It split
up one side as they tore it off, exposing the dead man to view.Although the marks of the cuts and bruises were still visible on
Philpot's face, they were softened down by the pallor of death, and a
placid, peaceful expression pervaded his features.His hands were
crossed upon his breast, and as he lay there in the snow-white grave
clothes, almost covered in by the white lace frill that bordered the
sides of the coffin, he looked like one in a profound and tranquil
sleep.They laid the broken lid on the bed, and placed the two coffins side by
side on the floor as close together as possible.Sawkins stood at one
side holding the candle in his left hand and ready to render with his
right any assistance that might unexpectedly prove to be necessary.Crass, standing at the foot, took hold of the body by the ankles, while
Hunter at the other end seized it by the shoulders with his huge,
clawlike hands, which resembled the talons of some obscene bird of
prey, and they dragged it out and placed it in the other coffin.Whilst Hunter--hovering ghoulishly over the corpse--arranged the grave
clothes and the frilling, Crass laid the broken cover on the top of the
other coffin and pushed it under the bed out of the way.Then he
selected the necessary screws and nails from the bag, and Hunter having
by this time finished, they proceeded to screw down the lid.Then they
lifted the coffin on to the tressels, covering it over with the sheet,
and the appearance it then presented was so exactly similar to what
they had seen when they first entered the room, that it caused the same
thought to occur to all of them: Suppose Snatchum took it into his head
to come there and take the body out again?If he were to do so and
take it up to the cemetery they might be compelled to give up the
certificate to him and then all their trouble would be lost.After a brief consultation, they resolved that it would be safer to
take the corpse on the handcart to the yard and keep it in the
carpenter's shop until the funeral, which could take place from there.Crass and Sawkins accordingly lifted the coffin off the tressels,
and--while Hunter held the light--proceeded to carry it downstairs, a
task of considerable difficulty owing to the narrowness of the
staircase and the landing.However, they got it down at last and,
having put it on the handcart, covered it over with the black wrapper.It was still raining and the lamp in the cart was nearly out, so
Sawkins trimmed the wick and relit it before they started.Hunter wished them 'Good-night' at the corner of the street, because it
was not necessary for him to accompany them to the yard--they would be
able to manage all that remained to be done by themselves.He said he
would make the arrangements for the funeral as soon as he possibly
could the next morning, and he would come to the job and let them know,
as soon as he knew himself, at what time they would have to be in
attendance to act as bearers.He had gone a little distance on his way
when he stopped and turned back to them.'It's not necessary for either of you to make a song about this
business, you know,' he said.The two men said that they quite understood that: he could depend on
their keeping their mouths shut.When Hunter had gone, Crass drew out his watch.A little way down the road the lights of a public house were
gleaming through the mist.'We shall be just in time to get a drink before closing time if we buck
up,' he said.And with this object they hurried on as fast as they
could.When they reached the tavern they left the cart standing by the kerb,
and went inside, where Crass ordered two pints of four-ale, which he
permitted Sawkins to pay for.'How are we going on about this job?'inquired the latter after they
had each taken a long drink, for they were thirsty after their
exertions.'I reckon we ought to 'ave more than a bob for it, don't
you?It's not like a ordinary "lift in".''Of course it ain't,' replied Crass.'We ought to 'ave about,
say'--reflecting--'say arf a dollar each at the very least.''I was going to say arf a crown,
myself.'Crass agreed that even half a crown would not be too much.''Ow are we going' on about chargin' it on our time sheets?'asked
Sawkins, after a pause.'If we just put a "lift in", they might only
pay us a bob as usual.'As a rule when they had taken a coffin home, they wrote on their time
sheets, 'One lift in', for which they were usually paid one shilling,
unless it happened to be a very high-class funeral, when they sometimes
got one and sixpence.They were never paid by the hour for these jobs.'I think the best way will be to put it like this,' he said at length.Also takin' corpse
to carpenter's shop."Sawkins said that would be a very good way to put it, and they finished
their beer just as the landlord intimated that it was closing time.The cart was standing where they left it, the black cloth saturated
with the rain, which dripped mournfully from its sable folds.When they reached the plot of waste ground over which they had to pass
in order to reach the gates of the yard, they had to proceed very
cautiously, for it was very dark, and the lantern did not give much
light.A number of carts and lorries were standing there, and the path
wound through pools of water and heaps of refuse.After much
difficulty and jolting, they reached the gate, which Crass unlocked
with the key he had obtained from the office earlier in the evening.They soon opened the door of the carpenter's shop and, after lighting
the gas, they arranged the tressels and then brought in the coffin and
placed it upon them.Then they locked the door and placed the key in
its usual hiding-place, but the key of the outer gate they took with
them and dropped into the letter-box at the office, which they had to
pass on their way home.As they turned away from the door, they were suddenly confronted by a
policeman who flashed his lantern in their faces and demanded to know
why they had tried the lock...

The next morning was a very busy one for Hunter, who had to see several
new jobs commenced.Most of them would
only take two or three days from start to finish.Attending to this work occupied most of his morning, but all the same
he managed to do the necessary business connected with the funeral,
which he arranged to take place at two o'clock on Wednesday afternoon
from the mortuary, where the coffin had been removed during the day,
Hunter deciding that it would not look well to have the funeral start
from the workshop.Although Hunter had kept it as quiet as possible, there was a small
crowd, including several old workmates of Philpot's who happened to be
out of work, waiting outside the mortuary to see the funeral start, and
amongst them were Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk, who were both sober.Barrington and Owen were also there, having left work for the day in
order to go to the funeral.They were there too in a sense as the
representatives of the other workmen, for Barrington carried a large
wreath which had been subscribed for voluntarily by Rushton's men.They could not all afford to lose the time to attend the funeral,
although most of them would have liked to pay that tribute of regard to
their old mate, so they had done this as the next best thing.Attached
to the wreath was a strip of white satin ribbon, upon which Owen had
painted a suitable inscription.Promptly at two o'clock the hearse and the mourning coach drove up with
Hunter and the four bearers--Crass, Slyme, Payne and Sawkins, all
dressed in black with frock coats and silk hats.Although they were
nominally attired in the same way, there was a remarkable dissimilarity
in their appearance.Crass's coat was of smooth, intensely black
cloth, having been recently dyed, and his hat was rather low in the
crown, being of that shape that curved outwards towards the top.Hunter's coat was a kind of serge with a rather rusty cast of colour
and his hat was very tall and straight, slightly narrower at the crown
than at the brim.As for the others, each of them had a hat of a
different fashion and date, and their 'black' clothes ranged from rusty
brown to dark blue.These differences were due to the fact that most of the garments had
been purchased at different times from different second-hand clothes
shops, and never being used except on such occasions as the present,
they lasted for an indefinite time.When the coffin was brought out and placed in the hearse, Hunter laid
upon it the wreath that Barrington gave him, together with the another
he had brought himself, which had a similar ribbon with the words:
'From Rushton & Co.Seeing that Barrington and Owen were the only occupants of the
carriage, Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk came up to the door and asked
if there was any objection to their coming and as neither Owen nor
Barrington objected, they did not think it necessary to ask anyone
else's permission, so they got in.Meanwhile, Hunter had taken his position a few yards in front of the
hearse and the bearers each his proper position, two on each side.As
the procession turned into the main road, they saw Snatchum standing at
the corner looking very gloomy.Hunter kept his eyes fixed straight
ahead and affected not to see him, but Crass could not resist the
temptation to indulge in a jeering smile, which so enraged Snatchum
that he shouted out:

'It don't matter!The distance to the cemetery was about three miles, so as soon as they
got out of the busy streets of the town, Hunter called a halt, and got
up on the hearse beside the driver, Crass sat on the other side, and
two of the other bearers stood in the space behind the driver's seat,
the fourth getting up beside the driver of the coach; and then they
proceeded at a rapid pace.As they drew near to the cemetery they slowed down, and finally stopped
when about fifty yards from the gate.Then Hunter and the bearers
resumed their former position, and they passed through the open gate
and up to the door of the church, where they were received by the
clerk--a man in a rusty black cassock, who stood by while they carried
the coffin in and placed it on a kind of elevated table which revolved
on a pivot.They brought it in footfirst, and as soon as they had
placed it upon the table, the clerk swung it round so as to bring the
foot of the coffin towards the door ready to be carried out again.There was a special pew set apart for the undertakers, and in this
Hunter and the bearers took their seats to await the arrival of the
clergyman.Barrington and the three others sat on the opposite side.There was no altar or pulpit in this church, but a kind of reading desk
stood on a slightly raised platform at the other end of the aisle.After a wait of about ten minutes, the clergyman entered and, at once
proceeding to the desk, began to recite in a rapid and wholly
unintelligible manner the usual office.If it had not been for the
fact that each of his hearers had a copy of the words--for there was a
little book in each pew--none of them would have been able to gather
the sense of what the man was gabbling.Under any other circumstances,
the spectacle of a human being mouthing in this absurd way would have
compelled laughter, and so would the suggestion that this individual
really believed that he was addressing the Supreme Being.His attitude
and manner were contemptuously indifferent.While he recited, intoned,
or gabbled, the words of the office, he was reading the certificate and
some other paper the clerk had placed upon the desk, and when he had
finished reading these, his gaze wandered abstractedly round the
chapel, resting for a long time with an expression of curiosity upon
Bill Bates and the Semi-drunk, who were doing their best to follow in
their books the words he was repeating.He next turned his attention to
his fingers, holding his hand away from him nearly at arm's length and
critically examining the nails.From time to time as this miserable mockery proceeded the clerk in the
rusty black cassock mechanically droned out a sonorous 'Ah-men', and
after the conclusion of the lesson the clergyman went out of the
church, taking a short cut through the grave-stones and monuments,
while the bearers again shouldered the coffin and followed the clerk to
the grave.When they arrived within a few yards of their destination,
they were rejoined by the clergyman, who was waiting for them at the
corner of one of the paths.He put himself at the head of the
procession with an open book in his hand, and as they walked slowly
along, he resumed his reading or repetition of the words of the service.He had on an old black cassock and a much soiled and slightly torn
surplice.The unseemly appearance of this dirty garment was heightened
by the circumstance that he had not taken the trouble to adjust it
properly.It hung all lop-sided, showing about six inches more of the
black cassock underneath one side than the other.However, perhaps it
is not right to criticize this person's appearance so severely, because
the poor fellow was paid only seven-and-six for each burial, and as
this was only the fourth funeral he had officiated at that day,
probably he could not afford to wear clean linen--at any rate, not for
the funerals of the lower classes.He continued his unintelligible jargon while they were lowering the
coffin into the grave, and those who happened to know the words of the
office by heart were, with some difficulty, able to understand what he
was saying:

'Forasmuch as it hath pleased Almighty God of His great mercy to take
unto Himself the soul of our Dear Brother here departed, we therefore
commit his body to the ground; earth to earth; ashes to ashes, dust to
dust--'

The earth fell from the clerk's hand and rattled on the lid of the
coffin with a mournful sound, and when the clergyman had finished
repeating the remainder of the service, he turned and walked away in
the direction of the church.Hunter and the rest of the funeral party
made their way back towards the gate of the cemetery where the hearse
and the carriage were waiting.On their way they saw another funeral procession coming towards them.It was a very plain-looking closed hearse with only one horse.There
was no undertaker in front and no bearers walked by the sides.Three men, evidently dressed in their Sunday clothes, followed behind
the hearse.As they reached the church door, four old men who were
dressed in ordinary everyday clothes, came forward and opening the
hearse took out the coffin and carried it into the church, followed by
the other three, who were evidently relatives of the deceased.The
four old men were paupers--inmates of the workhouse, who were paid
sixpence each for acting as bearers.They were just taking out the coffin from the hearse as Hunter's party
was passing, and most of the latter paused for a moment and watched
them carry it into the church.The roughly made coffin was of white
deal, not painted or covered in any way, and devoid of any fittings or
ornament with the exception of a square piece of zinc on the lid.None
of Rushton's party was near enough to recognize any of the mourners or
to read what was written on the zinc, but if they had been they would
have seen, roughly painted in black letters

                                     J.L.Aged 67

and some of them would have recognized the three mourners who were Jack
Linden's sons.As for the bearers, they were all retired working men who had come into
their 'titles'.One of them was old Latham, the venetian blind maker.Chapter 48

The Wise men of the East


At the end of the following week there was a terrible slaughter at
Rushton's.Barrington and all the casual hands were sacked, including
Newman, Easton and Harlow, and there was so little work that it looked
as if everyone else would have to stand off also.The summer was
practically over, so those who were stood off had but a poor chance of
getting a start anywhere else, because most other firms were
discharging hands as well.There was only one other shop in the town that was doing anything at
all to speak of, and that was the firm of Dauber and Botchit.This
firm had come very much to the front during the summer, and had
captured several big jobs that Rushton & Co.had expected to get,
besides taking away several of the latter's old customers.This firm took work at almost half the price that Rushton's could do it
for, and they had a foreman whose little finger was thicker than
Nimrod's thigh.Some of the men who had worked for both firms during
the summer, said that after working for Dauber and Botchit, working for
Rushton seemed like having a holiday.'There's one bloke there,' said Newman, in conversation with Harlow and
Easton.'There's one bloke there wot puts up twenty-five rolls o'
paper in a day an' trims and pastes for 'imself; and as for the
painters, nearly everyone of 'em gets over as much work as us three put
together, and if you're working there you've got to do the same or get
the sack.'However much truth or falsehood or exaggeration there may have been in
the stories of the sweating and driving that prevailed at Dauber and
Botchit's, it was an indisputable fact that the other builders found it
very difficult to compete with them, and between the lot of them what
work there was to do was all finished or messed up in about a quarter
of the time that it would have taken to do it properly.By the end of September there were great numbers of men out of
employment, and the practical persons who controlled the town were
already preparing to enact the usual farce of 'Dealing' with the
distress that was certain to ensue.Mr Bosher talked of
reopening the Labour Yard; the secretary of the OBS appealed for more
money and cast-off clothing and boots--the funds of the Society had
been depleted by the payment of his quarter's salary.There were
rumours that the Soup Kitchen would be reopened at an early date for
the sale of 'nourishment', and charitable persons began to talk of
Rummage Sales and soup tickets.Now and then, whenever a 'job' 'came in', a few of Rushton's men were
able to put in a few hours' work, but Barrington never went back.His
manner of life was the subject of much speculation on the part of his
former workmates, who were not a little puzzled by the fact that he was
much better dressed than they had ever known him to be before, and that
he was never without money.He generally had a tanner or a bob to
lend, and was always ready to stand a drink, to say nothing of what it
must have cost him for the quantities of Socialist pamphlets and
leaflets that he gave away broadcast.He lodged over at Windley, but
he used to take his meals at a little coffee tavern down town, where he
used often to invite one or two of his old mates to take dinner with
him.It sometimes happened that one of them would invite him home of
an evening, to drink a cup of tea, or to see some curiosity that the
other thought would interest him, and on these occasions--if there were
any children in the house to which they were going--Barrington usually
made a point of going into a shop on their way, and buying a bag of
cakes or fruit for them.All sorts of theories were put forward to account for his apparent
affluence.Some said he was a toff in disguise; others that he had
rich relations who were ashamed of him because he was a Socialist, and
who allowed him so much a week so long as he kept away from them and
did not use his real name.Some of the Liberals said that he was in
the pay of the Tories, who were seeking by underhand methods to split
up the Progressive Liberal Party.Just about that time several
burglaries took place in the town, the thieves getting clear away with
the plunder, and this circumstance led to a dark rumour that Barrington
was the culprit, and that it was these ill-gotten gains that he was
spending so freely.About the middle of October an event happened that drew the town into a
state of wild excitement, and such comparatively unimportant subjects
as unemployment and starvation were almost forgotten.Sir Graball D'Encloseland had been promoted to yet a higher post in the
service of the country that he owned such a large part of; he was not
only to have a higher and more honourable position, but also--as was
nothing but right--a higher salary.His pay was to be increased to
seven thousand five hundred a year or one hundred and fifty pounds per
week, and in consequence of this promotion it was necessary for him to
resign his seat and seek re-election.The ragged-trousered Tory workmen as they loitered about the streets,
their stomachs empty, said to each other that it was a great honour for
Mugsborough that their Member should be promoted in this way.They
boasted about it and assumed as much swagger in their gait as their
broken boots permitted.They stuck election cards bearing Sir Graball's photograph in their
windows and tied bits of blue and yellow ribbon--Sir Graball's
colours--on their underfed children.They said that an election had been sprung
on them--they had been taken a mean advantage of--they had no candidate
ready.They had no complaint to make about the salary, all they complained of
was the short notice.It wasn't fair because while they--the leading
Liberals--had been treating the electors with the contemptuous
indifference that is customary, Sir Graball D'Encloseland had been most
active amongst his constituents for months past, cunningly preparing
for the contest.He had really been electioneering for the past six
months!Last winter he had kicked off at quite a number of football
matches besides doing all sorts of things for the local teams.He had
joined the Buffalos and the Druids, been elected President of the Skull
and Crossbones Boys' Society, and, although he was not himself an
abstainer, he was so friendly to Temperance that he had on several
occasions, taken the chair at teetotal meetings, to say nothing of the
teas to the poor school children and things of that sort.In short, he
had been quite an active politician, in the Tory sense of the word, for
months past and the poor Liberals had not smelt a rat until the
election was sprung upon them.A hurried meeting of the Liberal Three Hundred was held, and a
deputation sent to London to find a candidate but as there was only a
week before polling day they were unsuccessful in their mission.Another meeting was held, presided over by Mr Adam Sweater--Rushton and
Didlum also being present.Profound dejection was depicted on the countenances of those assembled
slave-drivers as they listened to the delegates' report.The sombre
silence that followed was broken at length by Mr Rushton, who suddenly
started up and said that he began to think they had made a mistake in
going outside the constituency at all to look for a man.It was
strange but true that a prophet never received honour in his own land.They had been wasting the precious time running about all over the
country, begging and praying for a candidate, and overlooking the fact
that they had in their midst a gentleman--a fellow townsman, who, he
believed, would have a better chance of success than any stranger.Surely they would all agree--if they could only prevail upon him to
stand--that Adam Sweater would be an ideal Liberal Candidate!While Mr Rushton was speaking the drooping spirits of the Three Hundred
were reviving, and at the name of Sweater they all began to clap their
hands and stamp their feet.Loud shouts of enthusiastic approval burst
forth, and cries of 'Good old Sweater' resounded through the room.When Sweater rose to reply, the tumult died away as suddenly as it had
commenced.He thanked them for the honour they were conferring upon
him.There was no time to waste in words or idle compliments; rather
than allow the Enemy to have a walk-over, he would accede to their
request and contest the seat.A roar of applause burst from the throats of the delighted Three
Hundred.Outside the hall in which the meeting was being held a large crowd of
poverty-stricken Liberal working men, many of them wearing broken boots
and other men's cast-off clothing, was waiting to hear the report of
the slave-drivers' deputation, and as soon as Sweater had consented to
be nominated, Didlum rushed and opened the window overlooking the
street and shouted the good news down to the crowd, which joined in the
cheering.In response to their demands for a speech, Sweater brought
his obese carcass to the window and addressed a few words to them,
reminding them of the shortness of the time at their disposal, and
intreating them to work hard in order that the Grand old Flag might be
carried to victory.At such times these people forgot all about unemployment and
starvation, and became enthusiastic about 'Grand old Flags'.Their
devotion to this flag was so great that so long as they were able to
carry it to victory, they did not mind being poverty stricken and
hungry and ragged; all that mattered was to score off their hated
'enemies' their fellow countrymen the Tories, and carry the grand old
flag to victory.The fact that they had carried the flag to victory so
often in the past without obtaining any of the spoils, did not seem to
damp their ardour in the least.Being philanthropists, they were
content--after winning the victory--that their masters should always do
the looting.At the conclusion of Sweater's remarks the philanthropists gave three
frantic cheers and then someone in the crowd shouted 'What's the
colour?'After a hasty consultation with Rushton, who being a'master'
decorator, was thought to be an authority on colours--green--grass
green--was decided upon, and the information was shouted down to the
crowd, who cheered again.Then a rush was made to Sweater's Emporium
and several yards of cheap green ribbon were bought, and divided up
into little pieces, which they tied into their buttonholes, and thus
appropriately decorated, formed themselves into military order, four
deep, and marched through all the principal streets, up and down the
Grand Parade, round and round the Fountain, and finally over the hill
to Windley, singing to the tune of 'Tramp, tramp, tramp, the Boys are
marching':

        'Vote, Vote, Vote for Adam Sweater!Adam Sweater is our man,
        And we'll have him if we can,
        Then we'll always have the biggest loaf for tea.'The spectacle presented by these men--some of them with grey heads and
beards--as they marked time or tramped along singing this childish
twaddle, would have been amusing if it had not been disgusting.By way of variety they sang several other things, including:

        'We'll hang ole Closeland
        On a sour apple tree,'

and

        'Rally, Rally, men of Windley
        For Sweater's sure to win.'As they passed the big church in Quality Street, the clock began to
strike.It was one of those that strike four chimes at each quarter of
the hour.It was now ten o'clock so there were sixteen musical chimes:

        Ding, dong!They all chanted A-dam Sweat-er' in time with the striking clock.In
the same way the Tories would chant:

        'Grab--all Close--land!The town was soon deluged with mendacious literature and smothered with
huge posters:

                      'Vote for Adam Sweater!'Vote for Sweater and Temperance Reform.''Vote for Sweater--Free Trade and Cheap Food.'or

      'Vote for D'Encloseland: Tariff Reform and Plenty of Work!'This beautiful idea--'Plenty of Work'--appealed strongly to the Tory
workmen.They seemed to regard themselves and their children as a sort
of machines or beasts of burden, created for the purpose of working for
the benefit of other people.They did not think it right that they
should Live, and enjoy the benefits of civilization.All they desired
for themselves and their children was 'Plenty of Work'.They marched about the streets singing their Marseillaise, 'Work, Boys,
Work and be contented', to the tune of 'Tramp, tramp, tramp the Boys
are marching', and at intervals as they tramped along, they gave three
cheers for Sir Graball, Tariff Reform, and--Plenty of Work.Both sides imported gangs of hired orators who held forth every night
at the corners of the principal streets, and on the open spaces from
portable platforms, and from motor cars and lorries.The Tories said
that the Liberal Party in the House of Commons was composed principally
of scoundrels and fools, the Liberals said that the Tory Party were
fools and scoundrels.A host of richly dressed canvassers descended
upon Windley in carriages and motor cars, and begged for votes from the
poverty-stricken working men who lived there.One evening a Liberal demonstration was held at the Cross Roads on
Windley Hill.Notwithstanding the cold weather, there was a great
crowd of shabbily dressed people, many of whom had not had a really
good meal for months.The moon was at the full,
and the scene was further illuminated by the fitful glare of several
torches, stuck on the end of twelve-foot poles.The platform was a
large lorry, and there were several speakers, including Adam Sweater
himself and a real live Liberal Peer--Lord Ammenegg.This individual
had made a considerable fortune in the grocery and provision line, and
had been elevated to the Peerage by the last Liberal Government on
account of his services to the Party, and in consideration of other
considerations.Both Sweater and Ammenegg were to speak at two other meetings that
night and were not expected at Windley until about eight-thirty, so to
keep the ball rolling till they arrived, several other gentlemen,
including Rushton--who presided--and Didlum, and one of the five pounds
a week orators, addressed the meeting.Mingled with the crowd were
about twenty rough-looking men--strangers to the town--who wore huge
green rosettes and loudly applauded the speakers.They also
distributed Sweater literature and cards with lists of the different
meetings that were to be held during the election.These men were
bullies hired by Sweater's agent.They came from the neighbourhood of
Seven Dials in London and were paid ten shillings a day.One of their
duties was to incite the crowd to bash anyone who disturbed the
meetings or tried to put awkward questions to the speakers.The hired orator was a tall, slight man with dark hair, beard and
moustache, he might have been called well-looking if it had not been
for a ugly scar upon his forehead, which gave him a rather sinister
appearance.He was an effective speaker; the audience punctuated his
speech with cheers, and when he wound up with an earnest appeal to
them--as working men--to vote for Adam Sweater, their enthusiasm knew
no bounds.'I've seen him somewhere before,' remarked Barrington, who was standing
in the crowd with Harlow, Owen and Easton.'So have I,' said Owen, with a puzzled expression.'But for the life
of me, I can't remember where.'Harlow and Easton also thought they had seen the man before, but their
speculations were put an end to by the roar of cheering that heralded
the arrival of the motor car, containing Adam Sweater and his friend,
Lord Ammenegg.Unfortunately, those who had arranged the meeting had
forgotten to provide a pair of steps, so Sweater found it a matter of
considerable difficulty to mount the platform.However, while his
friends were hoisting and pushing him up, the meeting beguiled the time
by singing:


        'Vote, vote, vote for Adam Sweater.'After a terrible struggle they succeeded in getting him on to the cart,
and while he was recovering his wind, Rushton made a few remarks to the
crowd.Sweater then advanced to the front, but in consequence of the
cheering and singing, he was unable to make himself heard for several
minutes.When at length he was able to proceed, ho made a very clever speech--it
had been specially written for him and had cost ten guineas.A large
part of it consisted of warnings against the dangers of Socialism.Sweater had carefully rehearsed this speech and he delivered it very
effectively.Some of those Socialists, he said, were well-meaning but
mistaken people, who did not realize the harm that would result if
their extraordinary ideas were ever put into practice.He lowered his
voice to a blood-curdling stage whisper as he asked:

'What is this Socialism that we hear so much about, but which so few
understand?What is it, and what does it mean?'Then, raising his voice till it rang through the air and fell upon the
ears of the assembled multitude like the clanging of a funeral bell, he
continued:

'It is madness!Black Ruin for the
rich, and consequently, of course, Blacker Ruin still for the poor!'As Sweater paused, a thrill of horror ran through the meeting.Men
wearing broken boots and with patches upon the seats and knees, and
ragged fringes round the bottoms of the legs of their trousers, grew
pale, and glanced apprehensively at each other.If ever Socialism did
come to pass, they evidently thought it very probable that they would
have to walk about in a sort of prehistoric highland costume, without
any trousers or boots at all.Toil-worn women, most of them dressed in other women's shabby cast-off
clothing--weary, tired-looking mothers who fed their children for the
most part on adulterated tea, tinned skimmed milk and bread and
margarine, grew furious as they thought of the wicked Socialists who
were trying to bring Ruin upon them.It never occurred to any of these poor people that they were in a
condition of Ruin, Black Ruin, already.But if Sweater had suddenly
found himself reduced to the same social condition as the majority of
those he addressed, there is not much doubt that he would have thought
that he was in a condition of Black Ruin.The awful silence that had fallen on the panic-stricken crowd, was
presently broken by a ragged-trousered Philanthropist, who shouted out:

'We knows wot they are, sir.Most of 'em is chaps wot's got tired of
workin' for their livin', so they wants us to keep 'em.'Encouraged by numerous expressions of approval from the other
Philanthropists, the man continued:

'But we ain't such fools as they thinks, and so they'll find out next
Monday.Most of 'em wants 'angin', and I wouldn't mind lendin' a 'and
with the rope myself.'Applause and laughter greeted these noble sentiments, and Sweater
resumed his address, when another man--evidently a Socialist--for he
was accompanied by three or four others who like himself wore red
ties--interrupted and said that he would like to ask him a question.No notice was taken of this request either by Mr Sweater or the
chairman, but a few angry cries of 'Order!'Sweater continued, but the man again interrupted and the cries of the
crowd became more threatening.Rushton started up and said that he
could not allow the speaker to be interrupted, but if the gentleman
would wait till the end of the meeting, he would have an opportunity of
asking his question then.The man said he would wait as desired; Sweater resumed his oration, and
presently the interrupter and his friends found themselves surrounded
by the gang of hired bullies who wore the big rosettes and who glared
menacingly at them.Sweater concluded his speech with an appeal to the crowd to deal a
'Slashing Bow at the Enemy' next Monday, and then amid a storm of
applause, Lord Ammenegg stepped to the front.He said that he did not
intend to inflict a long speech upon them that evening, and as it was
nomination day tomorrow he would not be able to have the honour of
addressing them again during the election; but even if he had wished to
make a long speech, it would be very difficult after the brilliant and
eloquent address they had just listened to from Mr Sweater, for it
seemed to him (Ammenegg) that Adam Sweater had left nothing for anyone
else to say.But he would like to tell them of a Thought that had
occurred to him that evening.They read in the Bible that the Wise Men
came from the East.Windley, as they all knew, was the East end of the
town.They were the men of the East, and he was sure that next Monday
they would prove that they were the Wise Men of the East, by voting for
Adam Sweater and putting him at the top of the poll with a 'Thumping
Majority'.The Wise Men of the East greeted Ammenegg's remarks with prolonged,
imbecile cheers, and amid the tumult his Lordship and Sweater got into
the motor car and cleared off without giving the man with the red tie
or anyone else who desired to ask questions any opportunity of doing
so.Rushton and the other leaders got into another motor car, and
followed the first to take part in another meeting down-town, which was
to be addressed by the great Sir Featherstone Blood.The crowd now resolved itself into military order, headed by the men
with torches and a large white banner on which was written in huge
black letters, 'Our man is Adam Sweater'.They marched down the hill singing, and when they reached the Fountain
on the Grand Parade they saw another crowd holding a meeting there.These were Tories and they became so infuriated at the sound of the
Liberal songs and by the sight of the banner, that they abandoned their
meeting and charged the processionists.Both
sides fought like savages, but as the Liberals were outnumbered by
about three to one, they were driven off the field with great
slaughter; most of the torch poles were taken from them, and the banner
was torn to ribbons.Then the Tories went back to the Fountain
carrying the captured torches, and singing to the tune of 'Has anyone
seen a German Band?''Has anyone seen a Lib'ral Flag,
        Lib'ral Flag, Lib'ral Flag?'While the Tories resumed their meeting at the Fountain, the Liberals
rallied in one of the back streets.Messengers were sent in various
directions for reinforcements, and about half an hour afterwards they
emerged from their retreat and swooped down upon the Tory meeting.They
overturned the platform, recaptured their torches, tore the enemy's
banner to tatters and drove them from their position.Then the
Liberals in their turn paraded the streets singing 'Has anyone seen a
Tory Flag?'and proceeded to the hall where Sir Featherstone was
speaking, arriving as the audience left.The crowd that came pouring out of the hall was worked up to a frenzy
of enthusiasm, for the speech they had just listened to had been a sort
of manifesto to the country.In response to the cheering of the processionists--who, of course, had
not heard the speech, but were cheering from force of habit--Sir
Featherstone Blood stood up in the carriage and addressed the crowd,
briefly outlining the great measures of Social Reform that his party
proposed to enact to improve the condition of the working classes; and
as they listened, the Wise Men grew delirious with enthusiasm.He
referred to Land Taxes and Death Duties which would provide money to
build battleships to protect the property of the rich, and provide Work
for the poor.Another tax was to provide a nice, smooth road for the
rich to ride upon in motor cars--and to provide Work for the poor.Another tax would be used for Development, which would also make Work
for the poor.A great point was made of the fact that the
rich were actually to be made to pay something towards the cost of
their road themselves!But nothing was said about how they would get
the money to do it.No reference was made to how the workers would be
sweated and driven and starved to earn Dividends and Rent and Interest
and Profits to put into the pockets of the rich before the latter would
be able to pay for anything at all.These are the things, Gentlemen, that we propose to do for you, and, at
the rate of progress which we propose to adopt, I say without fear or
contradiction, that within the next Five Hundred years we shall so
reform social conditions in this country, that the working classes will
be able to enjoy some of the benefits of civilization.'The only question before you is: Are you willing to wait for Five
Hundred Years?''Yes, sir,' shouted the Wise Men with enthusiasm at the glorious
prospect.'Yes, Sir: we'll wait a thousand years if you like, Sir!''I've been waiting all my life,' said one poor old veteran, who had
assisted to 'carry the "Old Flag" to victory' times out of number in
the past and who for his share of the spoils of those victories was now
in a condition of abject, miserable poverty, with the portals of the
workhouse yawning open to receive him; 'I've waited all my life, hoping
and trusting for better conditions so a few more years won't make much
difference to me.''Don't you trouble to 'urry yourself, Sir,' shouted another Solomon in
the crowd.You know
better than the likes of us 'ow long it ought to take.'In conclusion, the great man warned them against being led away by the
Socialists, those foolish, unreasonable, impractical people who wanted
to see an immediate improvement in their condition; and he reminded
them that Rome was not built in a day.It did not appear to occur to any of
them that the rate at which the ancient Roman conducted their building
operations had nothing whatever to do with the case.Sir Featherstone Blood sat down amid a wild storm of cheering, and then
the procession reformed, and, reinforced by the audience from the hall,
they proceeded to march about the dreary streets, singing, to the tune
of the 'Men of Harlech':

        'Vote for Sweater, Vote for Sweater!Vote for Sweater, VOTE FOR SWEATER!'He's the Man, who has a plan,
        To liberate and reinstate the workers!'Men of Mugs'bro', show your mettle,
        Let them see that you're in fettle!Once for all this question settle
        Sweater shall Prevail!'The carriage containing Sir Featherstone, Adam Sweater, and Rushton and
Didlum was in the middle of the procession.The banner and the torches
were at the head, and the grandeur of the scene was heightened by four
men who walked--two on each side of the carriage, burning green fire in
frying pans.As they passed by the Slave Market, a poor, shabbily
dressed wretch whose boots were so worn and rotten that they were
almost falling off his feet, climbed up a lamp-post, and taking off his
cap waved it in the air and shrieked out: 'Three Cheers for Sir
Featherstone Blood, our future Prime Minister!'The Philanthropists cheered themselves hoarse and finally took the
horses out of the traces and harnessed themselves to the carriage
instead.''Ow much wages will Sir Featherstone get if 'e is made Prime
Minister?'asked Harlow of another Philanthropist who was also pushing
up behind the carriage.'Five thousand a year,' replied the other, who by some strange chance
happened to know.'That comes to a 'underd pounds a week.''Little enough, too, for a man like 'im,' said Harlow.'You're right, mate,' said the other, with deep sympathy in his voice.'Last time 'e 'eld office 'e was only in for five years, so 'e only
made twenty-five thousand pounds out of it.Of course 'e got a pension
as well--two thousand a year for life, I think it is; but after all,
what's that--for a man like 'im?''Nothing,' replied Harlow, in a tone of commiseration, and Newman, who
was also there, helping to drag the carriage, said that it ought to be
at least double that amount.However, they found some consolation in knowing that Sir Featherstone
would not have to wait till he was seventy before he obtained his
pension; he would get it directly he came out of office.The following evening Barrington, Owen and a few others of the same way
of thinking, who had subscribed enough money between them to purchase a
lot of Socialist leaflets, employed themselves distributing them to the
crowds at the Liberal and Tory meetings, and whilst they were doing
this they frequently became involved in arguments with the supporters
of the capitalist system.In their attempts to persuade others to
refrain from voting for either of the candidates, they were opposed
even by some who professed to believe in Socialism, who said that as
there was no better Socialist candidate the thing to do was to vote for
the better of the two.This was the view of Harlow and Easton, whom
they met.Harlow had a green ribbon in his buttonhole, but Easton wore
D'Encloseland's colours.One man said that if he had his way, all those who had votes should be
compelled to record them--whether they liked it or not--or be
disenfranchised!Barrington asked him if he believed in Tarrif Reform.The other replied that he opposed Tariff Reform because he believed it
would ruin the country.Barrington inquired if he were a supporter of
Socialism.The man said he was not, and when further questioned he
said that he believed if it were ever adopted it would bring black ruin
upon the country--he believed this because Mr Sweater had said so.When
Barrington asked him--supposing there were only two candidates, one a
Socialist and the other a Tariff Reformer--how would he like to be
compelled to vote for one of them, he was at a loss for an answer.The hired orators
continued to pour forth their streams of eloquence; and tons of
literature flooded the town.The walls were covered with huge posters:
'Another Liberal Lie.'Unconsciously each of these two parties put in some splendid work for
Socialism, in so much that each of them thoroughly exposed the
hypocrisy of the other.If the people had only had the sense, they
might have seen that the quarrel between the Liberal and Tory leaders
was merely a quarrel between thieves over the spoil; but unfortunately
most of the people had not the sense to perceive this.They were
blinded by bigoted devotion to their parties, and--inflamed with
maniacal enthusiasm--thought of nothing but 'carrying their flags to
victory'.At considerable danger to themselves, Barrington, Owen and the other
Socialists continued to distribute their leaflets and to heckle the
Liberal and Tory speakers.They asked the Tories to explain the
prevalence of unemployment and poverty in protected countries, like
Germany and America, and at Sweater's meetings they requested to be
informed what was the Liberal remedy for unemployment.From both
parties the Socialists obtained the same kinds of answer--threats of
violence and requests 'not to disturb the meeting'.These Socialists held quite a lot of informal meetings on their own.Every now and then when they were giving their leaflets away, some
unwary supporter of the capitalist system would start an argument, and
soon a crowd would gather round and listen.Sometimes the Socialists succeeded in arguing their opponents to an
absolute standstill, for the Liberals and Tones found it impossible to
deny that machinery is the cause of the overcrowded state of the labour
market; that the overcrowded labour market is the cause of
unemployment; that the fact of there being always an army of unemployed
waiting to take other men's jobs away from them destroys the
independence of those who are in employment and keeps them in
subjection to their masters.They found it impossible to deny that
this machinery is being used, not for the benefit of all, but to make
fortunes for a few.In short, they were unable to disprove that the
monopoly of the land and machinery by a comparatively few persons, is
the cause of the poverty of the majority.But when these arguments
that they were unable to answer were put before them and when it was
pointed out that the only possible remedy was the Public Ownership and
Management of the Means of production, they remained angrily silent,
having no alternative plan to suggest.At other times the meeting resolved itself into a number of quarrelsome
disputes between the Liberals and Tories that formed the crowd, which
split itself up into a lot of little groups and whatever the original
subject might have been they soon drifted to a hundred other things,
for most of the supporters of the present system seemed incapable of
pursuing any one subject to its logical conclusion.A discussion would
be started about something or other; presently an unimportant side
issue would crop up, then the original subject would be left
unfinished, and they would argue and shout about the side issue.In a
little while another side issue would arise, and then the first side
issue would be abandoned also unfinished, and an angry wrangle about
the second issue would ensue, the original subject being altogether
forgotten.They did not seem to really desire to discover the truth or to find out
the best way to bring about an improvement in their condition, their
only object seemed to be to score off their opponents.Usually after one of these arguments, Owen would wander off by himself,
with his head throbbing and a feeling of unutterable depression and
misery at his heart; weighed down by a growing conviction of the
hopelessness of everything, of the folly of expecting that his fellow
workmen would ever be willing to try to understand for themselves the
causes that produced their sufferings.It was not that those causes
were so obscure that it required exceptional intelligence to perceive
them; the causes of all the misery were so apparent that a little child
could easily be made to understand both the disease and the remedy; but
it seemed to him that the majority of his fellow workmen had become so
convinced of their own intellectual inferiority that they did not dare
to rely on their own intelligence to guide them, preferring to resign
the management of their affairs unreservedly into the hands of those
who battened upon and robbed them.They did not know the causes of the
poverty that perpetually held them and their children in its cruel
grip, and--they did not want to know!And if one explained those
causes to them in such language and in such a manner that they were
almost compelled to understand, and afterwards pointed out to them the
obvious remedy, they were neither glad nor responsive, but remained
silent and were angry because they found themselves unable to answer
and disprove.They remained silent; afraid to trust their own intelligence, and the
reason of this attitude was that they had to choose between the
evidence and their own intelligence, and the stories told them by their
masters and exploiters.And when it came to making this choice they
deemed it safer to follow their old guides, than to rely on their own
judgement, because from their very infancy they had had drilled into
them the doctrine of their own mental and social inferiority, and their
conviction of the truth of this doctrine was voiced in the degraded
expression that fell so frequently from their lips, when speaking of
themselves and each other--'The Likes of Us!'They did not know the causes of their poverty, they did not want to
know, they did not want to hear.All they desired was to be left alone so that they might continue to
worship and follow those who took advantage of their simplicity, and
robbed them of the fruits of their toil; their old leaders, the fools
or scoundrels who fed them with words, who had led them into the
desolation where they now seemed to be content to grind out treasure
for their masters, and to starve when those masters did not find it
profitable to employ them.It was as if a flock of foolish sheep
placed themselves under the protection of a pack of ravening wolves.Several times the small band of Socialists narrowly escaped being
mobbed, but they succeeded in disposing of most of their leaflets
without any serious trouble.Towards the latter part of one evening
Barrington and Owen became separated from the others, and shortly
afterwards these two lost each other in the crush.About nine o'clock, Barrington was in a large Liberal crowd, listening
to the same hired orator who had spoken a few evenings before on the
hill--the man with the scar on his forehead.The crowd was applauding
him loudly and Barrington again fell to wondering where he had seen
this man before.As on the previous occasion, this speaker made no
reference to Socialism, confining himself to other matters.Barrington
examined him closely, trying to recall under what circumstances they
had met previously, and presently he remembered that this was one of
the Socialists who had come with the band of cyclists into the town
that Sunday morning, away back at the beginning of the summer, the man
who had come afterwards with the van, and who had been struck down by a
stone while attempting to speak from the platform of the van, the man
who had been nearly killed by the upholders of the capitalist system.The Socialist had been clean-shaven--this man
wore beard and moustache--but Barrington was certain he was the same.When the man had concluded his speech he got down and stood in the
shade behind the platform, while someone else addressed the meeting,
and Barrington went round to where he was standing, intending to speak
to him.They were in the
vicinity of the Slave Market, near the Fountain, on the Grand Parade,
where several roads met; there was a meeting going on at every corner,
and a number of others in different parts of the roadway and on the
pavement of the Parade.Some of these meetings were being carried on by
two or three men, who spoke in turn from small, portable platforms they
carried with them, and placed wherever they thought there was a chance
of getting an audience.Every now and then some of these poor wretches--they were all paid
speakers--were surrounded and savagely mauled and beaten by a hostile
crowd.If they were Tariff Reformers the Liberals mobbed them, and
vice versa.Lines of rowdies swaggered to and fro, arm in arm,
singing, 'Vote, Vote, Vote, for good ole Closeland' or 'good ole
Sweater', according as they were green or blue and yellow.Gangs of
hooligans paraded up and down, armed with sticks, singing, howling,
cursing and looking for someone to hit.Others stood in groups on the
pavement with their hands thrust in their pockets, or leaned against
walls or the shutters of the shops with expressions of ecstatic
imbecility on their faces, chanting the mournful dirge to the tune of
the church chimes,

        'Good--ole--Sweat--er
        Good--ole--Sweat--er
        Good--ole--Sweat--er
        Good--ole--Sweat--er.'Other groups--to the same tune--sang 'Good--ole--Close--land'; and
every now and again they used to leave off singing and begin to beat
each other.Fights used to take place, often between workmen, about
the respective merits of Adam Sweater and Sir Graball D'Encloseland.The walls were covered with huge Liberal and Tory posters, which showed
in every line the contempt of those who published them for the
intelligence of the working men to whom they were addressed.There was
one Tory poster that represented the interior of a public house; in
front of the bar, with a quart pot in his hand, a clay pipe in his
mouth, and a load of tools on his back, stood a degraded-looking brute
who represented the Tory ideal of what an Englishman should be; the
letterpress on the poster said it was a man!This is the ideal of
manhood that they hold up to the majority of their fellow countrymen,
but privately--amongst themselves--the Tory aristocrats regard such
'men' with far less respect than they do the lower animals.They were more
cunning, more specious, more hypocritical and consequently more
calculated to mislead and deceive the more intelligent of the voters.When Barrington got round to the back of the platform, he found the man
with the scarred face standing alone and gloomily silent in the shadow.Barrington gave him one of the Socialist leaflets, which he took, and
after glancing at it, put it in his coat pocket without making any
remark.'I hope you'll excuse me for asking, but were you not formerly a
Socialist?'Even in the semi-darkness Barrington saw the other man flush deeply and
then become very pale, and the unsightly scar upon his forehead showed
with ghastly distinctiveness.'I am still a Socialist: no man who has once been a Socialist can ever
cease to be one.''You seem to have accomplished that impossibility, to judge by the work
you are at present engaged in.You must have changed your opinions
since you were here last.''No one who has been a Socialist can ever cease to be one.It is
impossible for a man who has once acquired knowledge ever to relinquish
it.A Socialist is one who understands the causes of the misery and
degradation we see all around us; who knows the only remedy, and knows
that that remedy--the state of society that will be called
Socialism--must eventually be adopted; is the only alternative to the
extermination of the majority of the working people; but it does not
follow that everyone who has sense enough to acquire that amount of
knowledge, must, in addition, be willing to sacrifice himself in order
to help to bring that state of society into being.When I first
acquired that knowledge,' he continued, bitterly, 'I was eager to tell
the good news to others.I sacrificed my time, my money, and my health
in order that I might teach others what I had learned myself.I did it
willingly and happily, because I thought they would be glad to hear,
and that they were worth the sacrifices I made for their sakes.'Even if you no longer believe in working for Socialism, there's no
need to work AGAINST it.If you are not disposed to sacrifice yourself
in order to do good to others, you might at least refrain from doing
evil.If you don't want to help to bring about a better state of
affairs, there's no reason why you should help to perpetuate the
present system.''Oh yes, there is, and a very good
reason too.''I don't think you could show me a reason,' said Barrington.The man with the scar laughed again, the same unpleasant, mirthless
laugh, and thrusting his hand into his trouser pocket drew it out again
full of silver coins, amongst which one or two gold pieces glittered.When I devoted my life and what abilities I
possess to the service of my fellow workmen; when I sought to teach
them how to break their chains; when I tried to show them how they
might save their children from poverty and shameful servitude, I did
not want them to give me money.And they paid me
with hatred and injury.But since I have been helping their masters to
rob them, they have treated me with respect.'Barrington made no reply and the other man, having returned the money
to his pocket, indicated the crowd with a sweep of his hand.the people you are trying to make idealists of!Some of
them howling and roaring like wild beasts, or laughing like idiots,
others standing with dull and stupid faces devoid of any trace of
intelligence or expression, listening to the speakers whose words
convey no meaning to their stultified minds, and others with their eyes
gleaming with savage hatred of their fellow men, watching eagerly for
an opportunity to provoke a quarrel that they may gratify their brutal
natures by striking someone--their eyes are hungry for the sight of
blood!Can't you see that these people, whom you are trying to make
understand your plan for the regeneration of the world, your doctrine
of universal brotherhood and love are for the most
part--intellectually--on a level with Hottentots?The only things they
feel any real interest in are beer, football, betting and--of
course--one other subject.Their highest ambition is to be allowed to
Work.'They have never had an independent thought in their lives.These are
the people whom you hope to inspire with lofty ideals!You might just
as well try to make a gold brooch out of a lump of dung!Try to reason
with them, to uplift them, to teach them the way to higher things.Devote your whole life and intelligence to the work of trying to get
better conditions for them, and you will find that they themselves are
the enemy you will have to fight against.They'll hate you, and, if
they get the chance, they'll tear you to pieces.But if you're a
sensible man you'll use whatever talents and intelligence you possess
for your own benefit.Don't think about Socialism or any other "ism".Concentrate your mind on getting money--it doesn't matter how you get
it, but--get it.If you can't get it honestly, get it dishonestly, but
get it!and then they'll have some respect for you.''There's something in what you say,' replied Barrington, after a long
pause, 'but it's not all.Circumstances make us what we are; and
anyhow, the children are worth fighting for.''You may think so now,' said the other, 'but you'll come to see it my
way some day.As for the children--if their parents are satisfied to
let them grow up to be half-starved drudges for other people, I don't
see why you or I need trouble about it.If you like to listen to
reason,' he continued after a pause, 'I can put you on to something
that will be worth more to you than all your Socialism.''Look here: you're a Socialist; well, I'm a Socialist too: that is, I
have sense enough to believe that Socialism is practical and inevitable
and right; it will come when the majority of the people are
sufficiently enlightened to demand it, but that enlightenment will
never be brought about by reasoning or arguing with them, for these
people are simply not intellectually capable of abstract
reasoning--they can't grasp theories.You know what the late Lord
Salisbury said about them when somebody proposed to give them some free
libraries: He said: "They don't want libraries: give them a circus."You see these Liberals and Tories understand the sort of people they
have to deal with; they know that although their bodies are the bodies
of grown men, their minds are the minds of little children.That is
why it has been possible to deceive and bluff and rob them for so long.But your party persists in regarding them as rational beings, and
that's where you make a mistake--you're simply wasting your time.'The only way in which it is possible to teach these people is by means
of object lessons, and those are being placed before them in increasing
numbers every day.The trustification of industry--the object lesson
which demonstrates the possibility of collective ownership--will in
time compel even these to understand, and by the time they have learnt
that, they will also have learned by bitter experience and not from
theoretical teaching, that they must either own the trusts or perish,
and then, and not, till then, they will achieve Socialism.Do you think it will make any real
difference--for good or evil--which of these two men is elected?''Well, you can't keep them both out--you have no candidate of your
own--why should you object to earning a few pounds by helping one of
them to get in?There are plenty of voters who are doubtful what to
do; as you and I know there is every excuse for them being unable to
make up their minds which of these two candidates is the worse, a word
from your party would decide them.Since you have no candidate of your
own you will be doing no harm to Socialism and you will be doing
yourself a bit of good.If you like to come along with me now, I'll
introduce you to Sweater's agent--no one need know anything about it.'He slipped his arm through Barrington's, but the latter released
himself.'Please yourself,' said the other with an affectation of indifference.You may choose to be a Jesus Christ
if you like, but for my part I'm finished.For the future I intend to
look after myself.As for these people--they vote for what they want;
they get--what they vote for; and by God, they deserve nothing better!They are being beaten with whips of their own choosing and if I had my
way they should be chastised with scorpions!For them, the present
system means joyless drudgery, semi-starvation, rags and premature
death.Well, let them have what
they vote for--let them drudge--let them starve!'The man with the scarred face ceased speaking, and for some moments
Barrington did not reply.'I suppose there is some excuse for your feeling as you do,' he said
slowly at last, 'but it seems to me that you do not make enough
allowance for the circumstances.From their infancy most of them have
been taught by priests and parents to regard themselves and their own
class with contempt--a sort of lower animals--and to regard those who
possess wealth with veneration, as superior beings.The idea that they
are really human creatures, naturally absolutely the same as their
so-called betters, naturally equal in every way, naturally different
from them only in those ways in which their so-called superiors differ
from each other, and inferior to them only because they have been
deprived of education, culture and opportunity--you know as well as I
do that they have all been taught to regard that idea as preposterous.'The self-styled "Christian" priests who say--with their tongues in
their cheeks--that God is our Father and that all men are brethren,
have succeeded in convincing the majority of the "brethren" that it is
their duty to be content in their degradation, and to order themselves
lowly and reverently towards their masters.Your resentment should be
directed against the deceivers, not against the dupes.''Well, go and try to undeceive them,' he said, as he returned to the
platform in response to a call from his associates.'Go and try to
teach them that the Supreme Being made the earth and all its fullness
for the use and benefit of all His children.Go and try to explain to
them that they are poor in body and mind and social condition, not
because of any natural inferiority, but because they have been robbed
of their inheritance.Go and try to show them how to secure that
inheritance for themselves and their children--and see how grateful
they'll be to you.'For the next hour Barrington walked about the crowded streets in a
dispirited fashion.His conversation with the renegade seemed to have
taken all the heart out of him.He still had a number of the leaflets,
but the task of distributing them had suddenly grown distasteful and
after a while he discontinued it.Like
one awakened from a dream he saw the people who surrounded him in a
different light.For the first time he properly appreciated the
offensiveness of most of those to whom he offered the handbills; some,
without even troubling to ascertain what they were about, rudely
refused to accept them; some took them and after glancing at the
printing, crushed them in their hands and ostentatiously threw them
away.Others, who recognized him as a Socialist, angrily or
contemptuously declined them, often with curses or injurious words.His attention was presently attracted to a crowd of about thirty or
forty people, congregated near a gas lamp at the roadside.The sound
of many angry voices rose from the centre of this group, and as he
stood on the outskirts of the crowd, Barrington, being tall, was able
to look into the centre, where he saw Owen.The light of the street
lamp fell full upon the latter's pale face, as he stood silent in the
midst of a ring of infuriated men, who were all howling at him at once,
and whose malignant faces bore expressions of savage hatred, as they
shouted out the foolish accusations and slanders they had read in the
Liberal and Tory papers.Socialists wished to do away with religion and morality!All the money that the working classes had
saved up in the Post Office and the Friendly Societies, was to be
Robbed from them and divided up amongst a lot of drunken loafers who
were too lazy to work.The King and all the Royal Family were to be
Done Away with!Owen made no attempt to reply, and the manner of the crowd became every
moment more threatening.It was evident that several of them found it
difficult to refrain from attacking him.It was a splendid opportunity
of doing a little fighting without running any risks.This fellow was
all by himself, and did not appear to be much of a man even at that.Those in the middle were encouraged by shouts from others in the crowd,
who urged them to 'Go for him' and at last--almost at the instant of
Barrington's arrival--one of the heroes, unable to contain himself any
longer, lifted a heavy stick and struck Owen savagely across the face.The sight of the blood maddened the others, and in an instant everyone
who could get within striking distance joined furiously in the
onslaught, reaching eagerly over each other's shoulders, showering
blows upon him with sticks and fists, and before Barrington could reach
his side, they had Owen down on the ground, and had begun to use their
boots upon him.Barrington felt like a wild beast himself, as he fiercely fought his
way through the crowd, spurning them to right and left with fists and
elbows.He reached the centre in time to seize the uplifted arm of the
man who had led the attack and wrenching the stick from his hand, he
felled him to the ground with a single blow.The remainder shrank
back, and meantime the crowd was augmented by others who came running
up.Some of these newcomers were Liberals and some Tories, and as these did
not know what the row was about they attacked each other.The Liberals
went for those who wore Tory colours and vice versa, and in a few
seconds there was a general free fight, though most of the original
crowd ran away, and in the confusion that ended, Barrington and Owen
got out of the crowd without further molestation.Monday was the last day of the election--polling day--and in
consequence of the number of motor cars that were flying about, the
streets were hardly safe for ordinary traffic.The wealthy persons who
owned these carriages...

The result of the poll was to be shown on an illuminated sign at the
Town Hall, at eleven o'clock that night, and long before that hour a
vast crowd gathered in the adjacent streets.About ten o'clock it
began to rain, but the crowd stood its ground and increased in numbers
as the time went by.At a quarter to eleven the rain increased to a
terrible downpour, but the people remained waiting to know which hero
had conquered.Eleven o'clock came and an intense silence fell upon
the crowd, whose eyes were fixed eagerly upon the window where the sign
was to be exhibited.To judge by the extraordinary interest displayed
by these people, one might have thought that they expected to reap some
great benefit or to sustain some great loss from the result, but of
course that was not the case, for most of them knew perfectly well that
the result of this election would make no more real difference to them
than all the other elections that had gone before.There were ten thousand
voters on the register.At a quarter past eleven the sign was
illuminated, but the figures were not yet shown.Next, the names of
the two candidates were slid into sight, the figures were still
missing, but D'Encloseland's name was on top, and a hoarse roar of
triumph came from the throats of his admirers.Then the two slides
with the names were withdrawn, and the sign was again left blank.After
a time the people began to murmur at all this delay and messing about,
and presently some of them began to groan and hoot.After a few minutes the names were again slid into view, this time with
Sweater's name on top, and the figures appeared immediately afterwards:

        Sweater.4,221
        D'Encloseland.4,200

It was several seconds before the Liberals could believe their eyes; it
was too good to be true.It is impossible to say what was the reason
of the wild outburst of delighted enthusiasm that followed, but
whatever the reason, whatever the benefit was that they expected to
reap--there was the fact.They were all cheering and dancing and
shaking hands with each other, and some of them were so overcome with
inexplicable joy that they were scarcely able to speak.It was
altogether extraordinary and unaccountable.A few minutes after the declaration, Sweater appeared at the window and
made a sort of a speech, but only fragments of it were audible to the
cheering crowd who at intervals caught such phrases as 'Slashing Blow',
'Sweep the Country', 'Grand Old Liberal Flag', and so on.Next
D'Encloseland appeared and he was seen to shake hands with Mr Sweater,
whom he referred to as 'My friend'.When the two 'friends' disappeared from the window, the part of the
Liberal crowd that was not engaged in hand-to-hand fights with their
enemies--the Tories--made a rush to the front entrance of the Town
Hall, where Sweater's carriage was waiting, and as soon as he had
placed his plump rotundity inside, they took the horses out and amid
frantic cheers harnessed themselves to it instead and dragged it
through the mud and the pouring rain all the way to 'The Cave'--most of
them were accustomed to acting as beasts of burden--where he again
addressed a few words to them from the porch.Afterwards as they walked home saturated with rain and covered from
head to foot with mud, they said it was a great victory for the cause
of progress!Chapter 49

The Undesired


That evening about seven o'clock, whilst Easton was down-town seeing
the last of the election, Ruth's child was born.After the doctor was gone, Mary Linden stayed with her during the hours
that elapsed before Easton came home, and downstairs Elsie and
Charley--who were allowed to stay up late to help their mother because
Mrs Easton was ill--crept about very quietly, and conversed in hushed
tones as they washed up the tea things and swept the floor and tidied
the kitchen.Easton did not return until after midnight, and all through the
intervening hours, Ruth, weak and tired, but unable to sleep, was lying
in bed with the child by her side.Her wide-open eyes appeared
unnaturally large and brilliant, in contrast with the almost death-like
paleness of her face, and there was a look of fear in them, as she
waited and listened for the sound of Easton's footsteps.Outside, the silence of the night was disturbed by many unusual noises:
a far-off roar, as of the breaking of waves on a seashore, arose from
the direction of the town, where the last scenes of the election were
being enacted.Every few minutes motor cars rushed past the house at a
furious rate, and the air was full of the sounds of distant shouts and
singing.Ruth listened and started nervously at every passing footstep.Those
who can imagine the kind of expression there would be upon the face of
a hunted thief, who, finding himself encompassed and brought to bay by
his pursuers, looks wildly around in a vain search for some way of
escape, may be able to form some conception of the terror-stricken way
in which she listened to every sound that penetrated into the stillness
of the dimly lighted room.And ever and again, when her wandering
glance reverted to the frail atom of humanity nestling by her side, her
brows contracted and her eyes filled with bitter tears, as she weakly
reached out her trembling hand to adjust its coverings, faintly
murmuring, with quivering lips and a bursting heart, some words of
endearment and pity.And then--alarmed by the footsteps of some chance
passerby, or by the closing of the door of a neighbouring house, and
fearing that it was the sound she had been waiting for and dreading
through all those weary hours, she would turn in terror to Mary Linden,
sitting in the chair at the bedside, sewing by the light of the shaded
lamp, and take hold of her arm as if seeking protection from some
impending danger.It was after twelve o'clock when Easton came home.Ruth recognized his
footsteps before he reached the house, and her heart seemed to stop
beating when she heard the clang of the gate, as it closed after he had
passed through.It had been Mary's intention to withdraw before he came into the room,
but the sick woman clung to her in such evident fear, and entreated her
so earnestly not to go away, that she remained.It was with a feeling of keen disappointment that Easton noticed how
Ruth shrank away from him, for he had expected and hoped, that after
this, they would be good friends once more; but he tried to think that
it was because she was ill, and when she would not let him touch the
child lest he should awaken it, he agreed without question.The next day, and for the greater part of the time during the next
fortnight, Ruth was in a raging fever.There were intervals when
although weak and exhausted, she was in her right mind, but most of the
time she was quite unconscious of her surroundings and often delirious.Mrs Owen came every day to help to look after her, because Mary just
then had a lot of needlework to do, and consequently could only give
part of her time to Ruth, who, in her delirium, lived and told over and
over again all the sorrow and suffering of the last few months.And so
the two friends, watching by her bedside, learned her dreadful secret.Sometimes--in her delirium--she seemed possessed of an intense and
terrible loathing for the poor little creature she had brought into the
world, and was with difficulty prevented from doing it violence.Once
she seized it cruelly and threw it fiercely from her to the foot of the
bed, as if it had been some poisonous or loathsome thing.And so it
often became necessary to take the child away out of the room, so that
she could not see or hear it, but when her senses came back to her, her
first thought was for the child, and there must have been in her mind
some faint recollection of what she had said and done in her madness,
for when she saw that the baby was not in its accustomed place her
distress and alarm were painful to see, as she entreated them with
tears to give it back to her.And then she would kiss and fondle it
with all manner of endearing words, and cry bitterly.Easton did not see or hear most of this; he only knew that she was very
ill; for he went out every day on the almost hopeless quest for work.Rushton's had next to nothing to do, and most of the other shops were
in a similar plight.Dauber and Botchit had one or two jobs going on,
and Easton tried several times to get a start for them, but was always
told they were full up.The sweating methods of this firm continued to
form a favourite topic of conversation with the unemployed workmen, who
railed at and cursed them horribly.It had leaked out that they were
paying only sixpence an hour to most of the skilled workmen in their
employment, and even then the conditions under which they worked were,
if possible, worse than those obtaining at most other firms.The men
were treated like so many convicts, and every job was a hell where
driving and bullying reigned supreme, and obscene curses and blasphemy
polluted the air from morning till night.The resentment of those who
were out of work was directed, not only against the heads of the firm,
but also against the miserable, half-starved drudges in their
employment.These poor wretches were denounced as'scabs' and
'wastrels' by the unemployed workmen but all the same, whenever Dauber
and Botchit wanted some extra hands they never had any difficulty in
obtaining them, and it often happened that those who had been loudest
and bitterest in their denunciations were amongst the first to rush off
eagerly to apply there for a job whenever there was a chance of getting
one.Frequently the light was seen burning late at night in Rushton's
office, where Nimrod and his master were figuring out prices and
writing out estimates, cutting down the amounts to the lowest possible
point in the hope of underbidding their rivals.Now and then they were
successful but whether they secured the work or not, Nimrod always
appeared equally miserable.If they got the 'job' it often showed such
a small margin of profit that Rushton used to grumble at him and
suggest mismanagement.If their estimates were too high and they lost
the work, he used to demand of Nimrod why it was possible for Dauber
and Botchit to do work so much more cheaply.As the unemployed workmen stood in groups at the corners or walked
aimlessly about the streets, they often saw Hunter pass by on his
bicycle, looking worried and harassed.He was such a picture of
misery, that it began to be rumoured amongst the men, that he had never
been the same since the time he had that fall off the bike; and some of
them declared, that they wouldn't mind betting that ole Misery would
finish up by going off his bloody rocker.At intervals--whenever a job came in--Owen, Crass, Slyme, Sawkins and
one or two others, continued to be employed at Rushton's, but they
seldom managed to make more than two or three days a week, even when
there was anything to do.Chapter 50

Sundered


During the next few weeks Ruth continued very ill.Although the
delirium had left her and did not return, her manner was still very
strange, and it was remarkable that she slept but little and at long
intervals.Mrs Owen came to look after her every day, not going back
to her own home till the evening.Frankie used to call for her as he
came out of school and then they used to go home together, taking
little Freddie Easton with them also, for his own mother was not able
to look after him and Mary Linden had so much other work to do.On Wednesday evening, when the child was about five weeks old, as Mrs
Owen was wishing her good night, Ruth took hold of her hand and after
saying how grateful she was for all that she had done, she asked
whether--supposing anything happened to herself--Nora would promise to
take charge of Freddie for Easton.Owen's wife gave the required
promise, at the same time affecting to regard the supposition as
altogether unlikely, and assuring her that she would soon be better,
but she secretly wondered why Ruth had not mentioned the other child as
well.Nora went away about five o'clock, leaving Ruth's bedroom door open so
that Mrs Linden could hear her call if she needed anything.About a
quarter of an hour after Nora and the two children had gone, Mary
Linden went upstairs to see Ruth, who appeared to have fallen fast
asleep; so she returned to her needlework downstairs.The weather had
been very cloudy all day, there had been rain at intervals and it was a
dark evening, so dark that she had to light the lamp to see her work.Charley sat on the hearthrug in front of the fire repairing one of the
wheels of a wooden cart that he had made with the assistance of another
boy, and Elsie busied herself preparing the tea.Easton was not yet home; Rushton & Co.had a few jobs to do and he had
been at work since the previous Thursday.The place where he was
working was some considerable distance away, so it was nearly half past
six when he came home.They heard him at the gate and at her mother's
direction Elsie went quickly to the front door, which was ajar, to ask
him to walk as quietly as possible so as not to wake Ruth.Mary had prepared the table for his tea in the kitchen, where there was
a bright fire with the kettle singing on the hob.He lit the lamp and
after removing his hat and overcoat, put the kettle on the fire and
while he was waiting for it to boil he went softly upstairs.There was
no lamp burning in the bedroom and the place would have been in utter
darkness but for the red glow of the fire, which did not dispel the
prevailing obscurity sufficiently to enable him to discern the
different objects in the room distinctly.The intense silence that
reigned struck him with a sudden terror.He crossed swiftly over to
the bed and a moment's examination sufficed to tell him that it was
empty.He called her name, but there was no answer, and a hurried
search only made it certain that she was nowhere in the house.Mrs Linden now remembered what Owen's wife had told her of the strange
request that Ruth had made, and as she recounted it to Easton, his
fears became intensified a thousandfold.He was unable to form any
opinion of the reason of her going or of where she had gone, as he
rushed out to seek for her.Almost unconsciously he directed his steps
to Owen's house, and afterwards the two men went to every place where
they thought it possible she might have gone, but without finding any
trace of her.Her father lived a short distance outside the town, and this was one of
the first places they went to, although Easton did not think it likely
she would go there, for she had not been on friendly terms with her
stepmother, and as he had anticipated, it was a fruitless journey.They sought for her in every conceivable place, returning often to
Easton's house to see if she had come home, but they found no trace of
her, nor met anyone who had seen her, which was, perhaps, because the
dreary, rain-washed streets were deserted by all except those whose
business compelled them to be out.About eleven o'clock Nora was standing at the front door waiting for
Owen and Easton, when she thought she could discern a woman's figure in
the shadow of the piers of the gate opposite.It was an unoccupied
house with a garden in front, and the outlines of the bushes it
contained were so vague in the darkness that it was impossible to be
certain; but the longer she looked the more convinced she became that
there was someone there.At last she summoned sufficient courage to
cross over the road, and as she nervously drew near the gate it became
evident that she had not been mistaken.There was a woman standing
there--a woman with a child in her arms, leaning against one of the
pillars and holding the iron bars of the gate with her left hand.Nora recognized her even in the semi-darkness.Her attitude
was one of extreme exhaustion, and as Nora touched her, she perceived
that she was wet through and trembling; but although she was almost
fainting with fatigue she would not consent to go indoors until
repeatedly assured that Easton was not there, and that Nora would not
let him see her if he came.And when at length she yielded and went
into the house she would not sit down or take off her hat or jacket
until--crouching on the floor beside Nora's chair with her face hidden
in the latter's lap--she had sobbed out her pitiful confession, the
same things that she had unwittingly told to the same hearer so often
before during the illness, the only fact that was new was the account
of her wanderings that night.She cried so bitterly and looked so forlorn and heartbroken and ashamed
as she faltered out her woeful story; so consumed with
self-condemnation, making no excuse for herself except to repeat over
and over again that she had never meant to do wrong, that Nora could
not refrain from weeping also as she listened.It appeared that, unable to bear the reproach that Easton's presence
seemed to imply, or to endure the burden of her secret any longer, and
always haunted by the thought of the lake in the park, Ruth had formed
the dreadful resolution of taking her own life and the child's.When
she arrived at the park gates they were closed and locked for the night
but she remembered that there was another means of entering--the place
at the far end of the valley where the park was not fenced in, so she
had gone there--nearly three miles--only to find that railings had
recently been erected and therefore it was no longer possible to get
into the park by that way.And then, when she found it impossible to
put her resolve into practice, she had realized for the first time the
folly and wickedness of the act she had meant to commit.But although
she had abandoned her first intention, she said she could never go home
again; she would take a room somewhere and get some work to do, or
perhaps she might be able to get a situation where they would allow her
to have the child with her, or failing that she would work and pay
someone to look after it; but she could never go home any more.If she
only had somewhere to stay for a few days until she could get something
to do, she was sure she would be able to earn her living, but she could
not go back home; she felt that she would rather walk about the streets
all night than go there again.It was arranged that Ruth should have the small apartment which had
been Frankie's playroom, the necessary furniture being obtained from a
second-hand shop close by.Easton did not learn the real reason of her
flight until three days afterwards.At first he attributed it to a
recurrence of the mental disorder that she had suffered from after the
birth of the child, and he had been glad to leave her at Owen's place
in Nora's care, but on the evening of the third day when he returned
home from work, he found a letter in Ruth's handwriting which told him
all there was to tell.When he recovered from the stupefaction into which he was thrown by the
perusal of this letter, his first thought was to seek out Slyme, but he
found upon inquiring that the latter had left the town the previous
morning.Slyme's landlady said he had told her that he had been
offered several months' work in London, which he had accepted.The
truth was that Slyme had heard of Ruth's flight--nearly everyone knew
about it as a result of the inquiries that had been made for her--and,
guessing the cause, he had prudently cleared out.Easton made no attempt to see Ruth, but he went to Owen's and took
Freddie away, saying he would pay Mrs Linden to look after the child
whilst he was at work.His manner was that of a deeply injured
man--the possibility that he was in any way to blame for what had
happened did not seem to occur to his mind at all.As for Ruth she made no resistance to his taking the child away from
her, although she cried about it in secret.She got some work a few
days afterwards--helping the servants at one of the large
boarding-houses on the Grand Parade.Nora looked after the baby for her while she was at work, an
arrangement that pleased Frankie vastly; he said it was almost as good
as having a baby of their very own.For the first few weeks after Ruth went away Easton tried to persuade
himself that he did not very much regret what had happened.Mrs Linden
looked after Freddie, and Easton tried to believe that he would really
be better off now that he had only himself and the child to provide for.At first, whenever he happened to meet Owen, they used to speak of
Ruth, or to be more correct, Easton used to speak of her; but one day
when the two men were working together Owen had expressed himself
rather offensively.He seemed to think that Easton was more to blame
than she was; and afterwards they avoided the subject, although Easton
found it difficult to avoid the thoughts the other man's words
suggested.Now and then he heard of Ruth and learnt that she was still working at
the same place; and once he met her suddenly and unexpectedly in the
street.They passed each other hurriedly and he did not see the
scarlet flush that for an instant dyed her face, nor the deathly pallor
that succeeded it.He never went to Owen's place or sent any communication to Ruth, nor
did she ever send him any; but although Easton did not know it she
frequently saw Freddie, for when Elsie Linden took the child out she
often called to see Mrs Owen.As time went on and the resentment he had felt towards her lost its
first bitterness, Easton began to think there was perhaps some little
justification for what Owen had said, and gradually there grew within
him an immense desire for reconciliation--to start afresh and to forget
all that had happened; but the more he thought of this the more
hopeless and impossible of realization it seemed.Although perhaps he was not conscious of it, this desire arose solely
from selfish motives.The money he earned seemed to melt away almost
as soon as he received it; to his surprise he found that he was not
nearly so well off in regard to personal comfort as he had been
formerly, and the house seemed to grow more dreary and desolate as the
wintry days dragged slowly by.Sometimes--when he had the money--he
sought forgetfulness in the society of Crass and the other frequenters
of the Cricketers, but somehow or other he could not take the same
pleasure in the conversation of these people as formerly, when he had
found it--as he now sometimes wondered to remember--so entertaining as
to almost make him forget Ruth's existence.One evening about three weeks before Christmas, as he and Owen were
walking homewards together from work, Easton reverted for the first
time to their former conversation.He spoke with a superior air: his
manner and tone indicating that he thought he was behaving with great
generosity.He would be willing to forgive her and have her back, he
said, if she would come: but he would never be able to tolerate the
child.Of course it might be sent to an orphanage or some similar
institution, but he was afraid Ruth would never consent to that, and he
knew that her stepmother would not take it.'If you can persuade her to return to you, we'll take the child,' said
Owen.'Do you think your wife would be willing?'We thought it a possible way for you, and my wife would
like to have the child.''But would you be able to afford it?''Of course,' said Easton, 'if Slyme comes back he might agree to pay
something for its keep.'After a long pause Easton continued: 'Would you mind asking Mrs Owen to
suggest it to Ruth?''If you like I'll get her to suggest it--as a message from you.''What I meant,' said Easton hesitatingly, 'was that your wife might
just suggest it--casual like--and advise her that it would be the best
way, and then you could let me know what Ruth said.''No,' replied Owen, unable any longer to control his resentment of the
other's manner, 'as things stand now, if it were not for the other
child, I should advise her to have nothing further to do with you.You
seem to think that you are acting a very generous part in being
"willing" to have her back, but she's better off now than she was with
you.I see no reason--except for the other child--why she should go
back to you.As far as I understand it, you had a good wife and you
ill-treated her.'I never raised my hand to her--at least only
once, and then I didn't hurt her.'Oh no: from what my wife tells me she only blames herself, but I'm
drawing my own conclusions.You may not have struck her, but you did
worse--you treated her with indifference and exposed her to temptation.What has happened is the natural result of your neglect and want of
care for her.The responsibility for what has happened is mainly
yours, but apparently you wish to pose now as being very generous and
to "forgive her"--you're "willing" to take her back; but it seems to me
that it would be more fitting that you should ask her to forgive you.'Easton made no answer and after a long silence the other continued:

'I would not advise her to go back to you on such terms as you seem to
think right, because if you became reconciled on such terms I don't
think either of you could be happy.Your only chance of happiness is
to realize that you have both done wrong; that each of you has
something to forgive; to forgive and never speak of it again.'Easton made no reply and a few minutes afterwards, their ways
diverging, they wished each other 'Good night'.They were working for Rushton--painting the outside of a new
conservatory at Mr Sweater's house, 'The Cave'.This job was finished
the next day and at four o'clock the boy brought the handcart, which
they loaded with their ladders and other materials.They took these
back to the yard and then, as it was Friday night, they went up to the
front shop and handed in their time sheets.Afterwards, as they were
about to separate, Easton again referred to the subject of their
conversation of the previous evening.He had been very reserved and
silent all day, scarcely uttering a word except when the work they had
been engaged in made it necessary to do so, and there was now a sort of
catch in his voice as he spoke.'I've been thinking over what you said last night; it's quite true.I wrote to Ruth last night and
admitted it to her.I'll take it as a favour if you and your wife will
say what you can to help me get her back.'Owen stretched out his hand and as the other took it, said: 'You may
rely on us both to do our best.'Chapter 51

The Widow's Son


The next morning when they went to the yard at half past eight o'clock
Hunter told them that there was nothing to do, but that they had better
come on Monday in case some work came in.They accordingly went on the
Monday, and Tuesday and Wednesday, but as nothing 'came in' of course
they did not do any work.On Thursday morning the weather was dark and
bitterly cold.The sky presented an unbroken expanse of dull grey and
a keen north wind swept through the cheerless streets.Owen--who had
caught cold whilst painting the outside of the conservatory at
Sweater's house the previous week--did not get to the yard until ten
o'clock.He felt so ill that he would not have gone at all if they had
not needed the money he would be able to earn if there was anything to
do.Strange though it may appear to the advocates of thrift, although
he had been so fortunate as to be in employment when so many others
were idle, they had not saved any money.On the contrary, during all
the summer they had not been able to afford to have proper food or
clothing.Every week most of the money went to pay arrears of rent or
some other debts, so that even whilst he was at work they had often to
go without some of the necessaries of life.They had broken boots,
shabby, insufficient clothing, and barely enough to eat.The weather had become so bitterly cold that, fearing he would be laid
up if he went without it any longer, he took his overcoat out of pawn,
and that week they had to almost starve.Not that it was much better
other weeks, for lately he had only been making six and a half hours a
day--from eight-thirty in the morning till four o'clock in the evening,
and on Saturday only four and a half hours--from half past eight till
one.This made his wages--at sevenpence an hour--twenty-one shillings
and sevenpence a week--that is, when there was work to do every day,
which was not always.Sometimes they had to stand idle three days out
of six.The wages of those who got sixpence halfpenny came out at one
pound and twopence--when they worked every day--and as for those
who--like Sawkins--received only fivepence, their week's wages amounted
to fifteen and sixpence.When they were only employed for two or three days or perhaps only a
few hours, their 'Saturday night' sometimes amounted to half a
sovereign, seven and sixpence, five shillings or even less.Then most
of them said that it was better than nothing at all.Many of them were married men, so, in order to make existence possible,
their wives went out charing or worked in laundries.They had children
whom they had to bring up for the most part on'skim' milk, bread,
margarine, and adulterated tea.Many of these children--little mites
of eight or nine years--went to work for two or three hours in the
morning before going to school; the same in the evening after school,
and all day on Saturday, carrying butchers' trays loaded with meat,
baskets of groceries and vegetables, cans of paraffin oil, selling or
delivering newspapers, and carrying milk.As soon as they were old
enough they got Half Time certificates and directly they were fourteen
they left school altogether and went to work all the day.When they
were old enough some of them tried to join the Army or Navy, but were
found physically unfit.It is not much to be wondered at that when they became a little older
they were so degenerate intellectually that they imagined that the
surest way to obtain better conditions would be to elect gangs of
Liberal and Tory land-grabbers, sweaters, swindlers and lawyers to rule
over them.When Owen arrived at the yard he found Bert White cleaning out the
dirty pots in the paint-shop.The noise he made with the scraping
knife prevented him from hearing Owen's approach and the latter stood
watching him for some minutes without speaking.The stone floor of the
paint shop was damp and shiny and the whole place was chilly as a tomb.The boy was trembling with cold and he looked pitifully undersized and
frail as he bent over his work with an old apron girt about him.Because it was so cold he was wearing his jacket with the ends of the
sleeves turned back to keep them clean, or to prevent them getting any
dirtier, for they were already in the same condition as the rest of his
attire, which was thickly encrusted with dried paint of many colours,
and his hands and fingernails were grimed with it.As he watched the poor boy bending over his task, Owen thought of
Frankie, and with a feeling akin to terror wondered whether he would
ever be in a similar plight.When he saw Owen, the boy left off working and wished him good morning,
remarking that it was very cold.There's lots of wood lying about the
yard.'Misery
wouldn't 'arf ramp if 'e caught me at it.I used to 'ave a fire 'ere
last winter till Rushton found out, and 'e kicked up an orful row and
told me to move meself and get some work done and then I wouldn't feel
the cold.''Oh, he said that, did he?'said Owen, his pale face becoming suddenly
suffused with blood.He went out into the yard and crossing over to where--under a
shed--there was a great heap of waste wood, stuff that had been taken
out of places where Rushton & Co.had made alterations, he gathered an
armful of it and was returning to the paintshop when Sawkins accosted
him.'You mustn't go burnin' any of that, you know!That's all got to be
saved and took up to the bloke's house.Misery spoke about it only
this mornin'.'He carried the wood into the shop and after
throwing it into the fireplace he poured some old paint over it, and,
applying a match, produced a roaring fire.Then he brought in several
more armfuls of wood and piled them in a corner of the shop.Bert took
no part in these proceedings, and at first rather disapproved of them
because he was afraid there would be trouble when Misery came, but when
the fire was an accomplished fact he warmed his hands and shifted his
work to the other side of the bench so as to get the benefit of the
heat.Owen waited for about half an hour to see if Hunter would return, but
as that disciple did not appear, he decided not to wait any longer.Before leaving he gave Bert some instructions:

'Keep up the fire with all the old paint that you can scrape off those
things and any other old paint or rubbish that's here, and whenever it
grows dull put more wood on.There's a lot of old stuff here that's of
no use except to be thrown away or burnt.If Hunter says
anything, tell him that I lit the fire, and that I told you to keep it
burning.If you want more wood, go out and take it.'On his way out Owen spoke to Sawkins.His manner was so menacing, his
face so pale, and there was such a strange glare in his eyes, that the
latter thought of the talk there had been about Owen being mad, and
felt half afraid of him.'I am going to the office to see Rushton; if Hunter comes here, you say
I told you to tell him that if I find the boy in that shop again
without a fire, I'll report it to the Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children.And as for you, if the boy comes out here to get
more wood, don't you attempt to interfere with him.''I don't want to interfere with the bloody kid,' grunted Sawkins.'It
seems to me as if he's gorn orf 'is bloody crumpet,' he added as he
watched Owen walking rapidly down the street.'I can't understand why
people can't mind their own bloody business: anyone would think the boy
belonged to 'IM.'That was just how the matter presented itself to Owen.The idea that
it was his own child who was to be treated in this way possessed and
infuriated him as he strode savagely along.In the vicinity of the
Slave Market on the Grand Parade he passed--without seeing
them--several groups of unemployed artisans whom he knew.Some of them
were offended and remarked that he was getting stuck up, but others,
observing how strange he looked, repeated the old prophecy that one of
these days Owen would go out of his mind.As he drew near to his destination large flakes of snow began to fall.He walked so rapidly and was in such a fury that by the time he reached
the shop he was scarcely able to speak.'Is--Hunter--or Rushton here?''Hunter isn't, but the guv'nor is.'He'll soon--know--that,' panted Owen as he strode up to the office
door, and without troubling to knock, flung it violently open and
entered.The atmosphere of this place was very different from that of the damp
cellar where Bert was working.A grate fitted with asbestos blocks and
lit with gas communicated a genial warmth to the air.Rushton was standing leaning over Miss Wade's chair with his left arm
round her neck.Owen recollected afterwards that her dress was
disarranged.She retired hastily to the far end of the room as Rushton
jumped away from her, and stared in amazement and confusion at the
intruder--he was too astonished and embarrassed to speak.Owen stood
panting and quivering in the middle of the office and pointed a
trembling finger at his employer:

'I've come--here--to tell--you--that--if I find young--Bert
White--working--down in that shop--without a fire--I'll have you
prosecuted.The place is not good enough for a stable--if you owned a
valuable dog--you wouldn't keep it there--I give you fair warning--I
know--enough--about you--to put you--where you deserve to be--if you
don't treat him better I'll have you punished I'll show you up.'Rushton continued to stare at him in mingled confusion, fear and
perplexity; he did not yet comprehend exactly what it was all about; he
was guiltily conscious of so many things which he might reasonably fear
to be shown up or prosecuted for if they were known, and the fact of
being caught under such circumstances with Miss Wade helped to reduce
him to a condition approaching terror.'If the boy has been there without a fire, I 'aven't known anything
about it,' he stammered at last.'Mr 'Unter has charge of all those
matters.''You--yourself--forbade him--to make a fire last winter--and
anyhow--you know about it now.You obtained money from his mother
under the pretence--that you were going--to teach him a trade--but for
the last twelve months--you have been using him--as if he were--a beast
of burden.I advise you to see to it--or I shall--find--means--to make
you--wish you had done so.'With this Owen turned and went out, leaving the door open, and Rushton
in a state of mind compounded of fear, amazement and anger.As he walked homewards through the snow-storm, Owen began to realize
that the consequence of what he had done would be that Rushton would
not give him any more work, and as he reflected on all that this would
mean to those at home, for a moment he doubted whether he had done
right.But when he told Nora what had happened she said there were
plenty of other firms in the town who would employ him--when they had
the work.He had done without Rushton before and could do so again;
for her part--whatever the consequences might be--she was glad that he
had acted as he did.'We'll get through somehow, I suppose,' said Owen, wearily.'There's
not much chance of getting a job anywhere else just now, but I shall
try to get some work on my own account.I shall do some samples of
show-cards the same as I did last winter and try to get orders from
some of the shops--they usually want something extra at this time, but
I'm afraid it is rather too late: most of them already have all they
want.''I shouldn't go out again today if I were you,' said Nora, noticing how
ill he looked.'You should stay at home and read, or write up those
minutes.'The minutes referred to were those of the last meeting of the local
branch of the Painters' Society, of which Owen was the secretary, and
as the snow continued to fall, he occupied himself after dinner in the
manner his wife suggested, until four o'clock, when Frankie returned
from school bringing with him a large snowball, and crying out as a
piece of good news that the snow was still falling heavily, and that he
believed it was freezing!They went to bed very early that night, for it was necessary to
economize the coal, and not only that, but--because the rooms were so
near the roof--it was not possible to keep the place warm no matter how
much coal was used.The fire seemed, if anything, to make the place
colder, for it caused the outer air to pour in through the joints of
the ill-fitting doors and windows.Owen lay awake for the greater part of the night.The terror of the
future made rest or sleep impossible.He got up very early the next
morning--long before it was light--and after lighting the fire, set
about preparing the samples he had mentioned to Nora, but found that it
would not be possible to do much in this direction without buying more
cardboard, for most of what he had was not in good condition.They had bread and butter and tea for breakfast.Frankie had his in
bed and it was decided to keep him away from school until after dinner
because the weather was so very cold and his only pair of boots were so
saturated with moisture from having been out in the snow the previous
day.'I shall make a few inquiries to see if there's any other work to be
had before I buy the cardboard,' said Owen, 'although I'm afraid it's
not much use.'Just as he was preparing to go out, the front door bell rang, and as he
was going down to answer it he saw Bert White coming upstairs.The boy
was carrying a flat, brown-paper parcel under his arm.'A corfin plate,' he explained as he arrived at the door.'Wanted at
once--Misery ses you can do it at 'ome, an' I've got to wait for it.'Owen and his wife looked at each other with intense relief.So he was
not to be dismissed after all.'There's a piece of paper inside the parcel with the name of the party
what's dead,' continued Bert, 'and here's a little bottle of Brunswick
black for you to do the inscription with.''Yes: he told me to tell you there's a job to be started Monday
morning--a couple of rooms to be done out somewhere.Got to be
finished by Thursday; and there's another job 'e wants you to do this
afternoon--after dinner--so you've got to come to the yard at one
o'clock.'E told me to tell you 'e meant to leave a message for you
yesterday morning, but 'e forgot.''What did he say to you about the fire--anything?''Yes: they both of 'em came about an hour after you went away--Misery
and the Bloke too--but they didn't kick up a row.I wasn't arf
frightened, I can tell you, when I saw 'em both coming, but they was
quite nice.The Bloke ses to me, "Ah, that's right, my boy," 'e ses.I'm going to send you some coke," 'e ses.And
then they 'ad a look round and 'e told Sawkins to put some new panes of
glass where the winder was broken, and--you know that great big
packing-case what was under the truck shed?''Well, 'e told Sawkins to saw it up and cover over the stone floor of
the paint-shop with it.It ain't 'arf all right there now.I've
cleared out all the muck from under the benches and we've got two sacks
of coke sent from the gas-works, and the Bloke told me when that's all
used up I've got to get a order orf Miss Wade for another lot.'At one o'clock Owen was at the yard, where he saw Misery, who
instructed him to go to the front shop and paint some numbers on the
racks where the wallpapers were stored.Whilst he was doing this work
Rushton came in and greeted him in a very friendly way.'I'm very glad you let me know about the boy working in that
paint-shop,' he observed after a few preliminary remarks.'I can
assure you as I don't want the lad to be uncomfortable, but you know I
can't attend to everything myself.I'm much obliged to you for telling
me about it; I think you did quite right; I should have done the same
myself.'Owen did not know what to reply, but Rushton walked off without
waiting...



Chapter 52

'It's a Far, Far Better Thing that I do, than I have Ever Done'


Although Owen, Easton and Crass and a few others were so lucky as to
have had a little work to do during the last few months, the majority
of their fellow workmen had been altogether out of employment most of
the time, and meanwhile the practical business-men, and the pretended
disciples of Christ--the liars and hypocrites who professed to believe
that all men are brothers and God their Father--had continued to enact
the usual farce that they called 'Dealing' with the misery that
surrounded them on every side.They continued to organize 'Rummage'
and 'Jumble' sales and bazaars, and to distribute their rotten cast-off
clothes and boots and their broken victuals and soup to such of the
Brethren as were sufficiently degraded to beg for them.The beautiful
Distress Committee was also in full operation; over a thousand Brethren
had registered themselves on its books.Of this number--after careful
investigation--the committee had found that no fewer than six hundred
and seventy-two were deserving of being allowed to work for their
living.The Committee would probably have given these six hundred and
seventy-two the necessary permission, but it was somewhat handicapped
by the fact that the funds at its disposal were only sufficient to
enable that number of Brethren to be employed for about three days.However, by adopting a policy of temporizing, delay, and general artful
dodging, the Committee managed to create the impression that they were
Dealing with the Problem.If it had not been for a cunning device invented by Brother Rushton, a
much larger number of the Brethren would have succeeded in registering
themselves as unemployed on the books of the Committee.In previous
years it had been the practice to issue an application form called a
'Record Paper' to any Brother who asked for one, and the Brother
returned it after filling it in himself.At a secret meeting of the
Committee Rushton proposed--amid laughter and applause, it was such a
good joke--a new and better way, calculated to keep down the number of
applicants.The result of this innovation was that no more forms were
issued, but the applicants for work were admitted into the office one
at a time, and were there examined by a junior clerk, somewhat after
the manner of a French Juge d'Instruction interrogating a criminal, the
clerk filling in the form according to the replies of the culprit.'Where did you live before you went there?''How long were you living at that place?''Did you owe any rent when you left?''What is your Trade, Calling, Employment, or Occupation?''Are you Married or single or a Widower or what?''What kind of a house do you live in?'What have you been doing for the last five years?What kind of work,
how many hours a day?'Give the full names and addresses of all the different employers you
have worked for during the last five years, and the reasons why you
left them?''Give the names of all the foremen you have worked under during the
last five years?''Do you get any money from any Club or Society, or from any Charity, or
from any other source?''Have you ever worked for a Distress Committee before?''Have you ever done any other kinds of work than those you have
mentioned?Do you think you would be fit for any other kind?When the criminal had answered all the questions, and when his answers
had all been duly written down, he was informed that a member of the
Committee, or an Authorized Officer, or some Other Person, would in due
course visit his home and make inquiries about him, after which the
Authorized Officer or Other Person would make a report to the
Committee, who would consider it at their next meeting.As the interrogation of each criminal occupied about half an hour, to
say nothing of the time he was kept waiting, it will be seen that as a
means of keeping down the number of registered unemployed the idea
worked splendidly.When Rushton introduced this new rule it was carried unanimously, Dr
Weakling being the only dissentient, but of course he--as Brother
Grinder remarked--was always opposed to any sensible proposal.There
was one consolation, however, Grinder added, they was not likely to be
pestered with 'im much longer; the first of November was coming and if
he--Grinder--knowed anything of working men they was sure to give
Weakling the dirty kick out directly they got the chance.A few days afterwards the result of the municipal election justified
Brother Grinder's prognostications, for the working men voters of Dr
Weakling's ward did give him the dirty kick out: but Rushton, Didlum,
Grinder and several other members of the band were triumphantly
returned with increased majorities.Mr Dauber, of Dauber and Botchit, had already been elected a Guardian
of the Poor.During all this time Hunter, who looked more worried and miserable as
the dreary weeks went by, was occupied every day in supervising what
work was being done and in running about seeking for more.Nearly
every night he remained at the office until a late hour, poring over
specifications and making out estimates.The police had become so
accustomed to seeing the light in the office that as a rule they took
no notice of it, but one Thursday night--exactly one week after the
scene between Owen and Rushton about the boy--the constable on the beat
observed the light there much later than usual.At first he paid no
particular attention to the fact, but when night merged into morning
and the light still remained, his curiosity was aroused.He knocked at the door, but no one came in answer, and no sound
disturbed the deathlike stillness that reigned within.The door was
locked, but he was not able to tell whether it had been closed from the
inside or outside, because it had a spring latch.The office window
was low down, but it was not possible to see in because the back of the
glass had been painted.The constable thought that the most probable explanation of the mystery
was that whoever had been there earlier in the evening had forgotten to
turn out the light when they went away; it was not likely that thieves
or anyone who had no business to be there would advertise their
presence by lighting the gas.He made a note of the incident in his pocket-book and was about to
resume his beat when he was joined by his inspector.The latter agreed
that the conclusion arrived at by the constable was probably the right
one and they were about to pass on when the inspector noticed a small
speck of light shining through the lower part of the painted window,
where a small piece of the paint had either been scratched or had
shelled off the glass.He knelt down and found that it was possible to
get a view of the interior of the office, and as he peered through he
gave a low exclamation.When he made way for his subordinate to look
in his turn, the constable was with some difficulty able to distinguish
the figure of a man lying prone upon the floor.It was an easy task for the burly policeman to force open the office
door: a single push of his shoulder wrenched it from its fastenings and
as it flew back the socket of the lock fell with a splash into a great
pool of blood that had accumulated against the threshold, flowing from
the place where Hunter was lying on his back, his arms extended and his
head nearly severed from his body.On the floor, close to his right
hand, was an open razor.An overturned chair lay on the floor by the
side of the table where he usually worked, the table itself being
littered with papers and drenched with blood.Within the next few days Crass resumed the role he had played when
Hunter was ill during the summer, taking charge of the work and
generally doing his best to fill the dead man's place, although--as he
confided to certain of his cronies in the bar of the Cricketers--he had
no intention of allowing Rushton to do the same as Hunter had done.One of his first jobs--on the morning after the discovery of the
body--was to go with Mr Rushton to look over a house where some work
was to be done for which an estimate had to be given.It was this
estimate that Hunter had been trying to make out the previous evening
in the office, for they found that the papers on his table were covered
with figures and writing relating to this work.These papers justified
the subsequent verdict of the Coroner's jury that Hunter committed
suicide in a fit of temporary insanity, for they were covered with a
lot of meaningless scribbling, the words wrongly spelt and having no
intelligible connection with each other.There was one sum that he had
evidently tried repeatedly to do correctly, but which came wrong in a
different way every time.The fact that he had the razor in his
possession seemed to point to his having premeditated the act, but this
was accounted for at the inquest by the evidence of the last person who
saw him alive, a hairdresser, who stated that Hunter had left the razor
with him to be sharpened a few days previously and that he had called
for it on the evening of the tragedy.He had ground this razor for Mr
Hunter several times before.Crass took charge of all the arrangements for the funeral.He bought a
new second-hand pair of black trousers at a cast-off clothing shop in
honour of the occasion, and discarded his own low-crowned silk
hat--which was getting rather shabby--in favour of Hunter's tall one,
which he found in the office and annexed without hesitation or scruple.It was rather large for him, but he put some folded strips of paper
inside the leather lining.Crass was a proud man as he walked in
Hunter's place at the head of the procession, trying to look solemn,
but with a half-smile on his fat, pasty face, destitute of colour
except one spot on his chin near his underlip, where there was a small
patch of inflammation about the size of a threepenny piece.This spot
had been there for a very long time.At first--as well as he could
remember--it was only a small pimple, but it had grown larger, with
something the appearance of scurvy.Crass attributed its continuation
to the cold having 'got into it last winter'.It was rather strange,
too, because he generally took care of himself when it was cold: he
always wore the warm wrap that had formerly belonged to the old lady
who died of cancer.However, Crass did not worry much about this
little sore place; he just put a little zinc ointment on it
occasionally and had no doubt that it would get well in time.Chapter 53

Barrington Finds a Situation


The revulsion of feeling that Barrington experienced during the
progress of the election was intensified by the final result.The
blind, stupid, enthusiastic admiration displayed by the philanthropists
for those who exploited and robbed them; their extraordinary apathy
with regard to their own interests; the patient, broken-spirited way in
which they endured their sufferings, tamely submitting to live in
poverty in the midst of the wealth they had helped to create; their
callous indifference to the fate of their children, and the savage
hatred they exhibited towards anyone who dared to suggest the
possibility of better things, forced upon him the thought that the
hopes he cherished were impossible of realization.The words of the
renegade Socialist recurred constantly to his mind:

'You can be a Jesus Christ if you like, but for my part I'm finished.For the future I intend to look after myself.As for these people,
they vote for what they want, they get what they vote for, and, by God!They are being beaten with whips of their
own choosing, and if I had my way they should be chastised with
scorpions.For them, the present system means joyless drudgery,
semi-starvation, rags and premature death; and they vote for it and
uphold it.Let them drudge and let
them starve!'These words kept ringing in his ears as he walked through the crowded
streets early one fine evening a few days before Christmas.The shops
were all brilliantly lighted for the display of their Christmas stores,
and the pavements and even the carriageways were thronged with
sightseers.Barrington was specially interested in the groups of shabbily dressed
men and women and children who gathered in the roadway in front of the
poulterers' and butchers' shops, gazing at the meat and the serried
rows of turkeys and geese decorated with  ribbons and rosettes.He knew that to come here and look at these things was the only share
many of these poor people would have of them, and he marvelled greatly
at their wonderful patience and abject resignation.But what struck him most of all was the appearance of many of the
women, evidently working men's wives.Their faded, ill-fitting
garments and the tired, sad expressions on their pale and careworn
faces.Some of them were alone; others were accompanied by little
children who trotted along trustfully clinging to their mothers' hands.The sight of these poor little ones, their utter helplessness and
dependence, their patched unsightly clothing and broken boots, and the
wistful looks on their pitiful faces as they gazed into the windows of
the toy-shops, sent a pang of actual physical pain to his heart and
filled his eyes with tears.He knew that these children--naked of joy
and all that makes life dear--were being tortured by the sight of the
things that were placed so cruelly before their eyes, but which they
were not permitted to touch or to share; and, like Joseph of old, his
heart yearned over his younger brethren.He felt like a criminal because he was warmly clad and well fed in the
midst of all this want and unhappiness, and he flushed with shame
because he had momentarily faltered in his devotion to the noblest
cause that any man could be privileged to fight for--the uplifting of
the disconsolate and the oppressed.He presently came to a large toy shop outside which several children
were standing admiring the contents of the window.He recognized some
of these children and paused to watch them and to listen to their talk.They did not notice him standing behind them as they ranged to and fro
before the window, and as he looked at them, he was reminded of the way
in which captive animals walk up and down behind the bars of their
cages.These children wandered repeatedly, backwards and forwards from
one end of the window to the other, with their little hands pressed
against the impenetrable plate glass, choosing and pointing out to each
other the particular toys that took their fancies.cried Charley Linden, enthusiastically indicating a
large strongly built waggon.'If I had that I'd give Freddie rides in
it and bring home lots of firewood, and we could play at fire engines
as well.''I'd rather have this railway,' said Frankie Owen.'There's a real
tunnel and real coal in the tenders; then there's the station and the
signals and a place to turn the engine round, and a red lantern to
light when there's danger on the line.''Mine's this doll--not the biggest one, the one in pink with clothes
that you can take off,' said Elsie; 'and this tea set; and this
needlecase for Mother.'Little Freddie had let go his hold of Elsie, to whom he usually clung
tightly and was clapping his hands and chuckling with delight and
desire.'But it's no use lookin' at them any longer,' continued Elsie, with a
sigh, as she took hold of Freddie's hand to lead him away.'It's no
use lookin' at 'em any longer; the likes of us can't expect to have
such good things as them.'This remark served to recall Frankie and Charley to the stern realities
of life, and turning reluctantly away from the window they prepared to
follow Elsie, but Freddie had not yet learnt the lesson--he had not
lived long enough to understand that the good things of the world were
not for the likes of him; so when Elsie attempted to draw him away he
pursed up his underlip and began to cry, repeating that he wanted a
gee-gee.The other children clustered round trying to coax and comfort
him by telling him that no one was allowed to have anything out of the
windows yet--until Christmas--and that Santa Claus would be sure to
bring him a gee-gee then; but these arguments failed to make any
impression on Freddie, who tearfully insisted upon being supplied at
once.Whilst they were thus occupied they caught sight of Barrington, whom
they hailed with evident pleasure born of the recollection of certain
gifts of pennies and cakes they had at different times received from
him.'Hello, Mr Barrington,' said the two boys in a breath.'Hello,' replied Barrington, as he patted the baby's cheek.'He wants that there 'orse, mister, the one with the real 'air on,'
said Charley, smiling indulgently like a grown-up person who realized
the absurdity of the demand.'Fweddie want gee-gee,' repeated the child, taking hold of Barrington's
hand and returning to the window.'Tell him that Santa Claus'll bring it to him on Christmas,' whispered
Elsie.'P'raps he'll believe you and that'll satisfy him, and he's
sure to forget all about it in a little while.''Are you still out of work, Mr Barrington?''I've got something to do at last.''Well, that's a good job, ain't it?''And whom do you think I'm working for?'echoed the children, opening their eyes to the fullest
extent.'Yes,' continued Barrington, solemnly.'You know, he is a very old man
now, so old that he can't do all his work himself.Last year he was so
tired that he wasn't able to get round to all the children he wanted to
give things to, and consequently a great many of them never got
anything at all.So this year he's given me a job to help him.He's
given me some money and a list of children's names, and against their
names are written the toys they are to have.My work is to buy the
things and give them to the boys and girls whose names are on the list.'The children listened to this narrative with bated breath.Incredible
as the story seemed, Barrington's manner was so earnest as to almost
compel belief.'Really and truly, or are you only having a game?'said Frankie at
length, speaking almost in a whisper.Elsie and Charley maintained an
awestruck silence, while Freddie beat upon the glass with the palms of
his hands.'Really and truly,' replied Barrington unblushingly as he took out his
pocket-book and turned over the leaves.'I've got the list here;
perhaps your names are down for something.'The three children turned pale and their hearts beat violently as they
listened wide-eyed for what was to follow.'Let me see,' continued Barrington, scanning the pages of the book,
'Why, yes, here they are!Elsie Linden, one doll with clothes that can
be taken off, one tea-set, one needlecase.Freddie Easton, one horse
with real hair.Charley Linden, one four-wheeled waggon full of
groceries.Frankie Owen, one railway with tunnel, station, train with
real coal for engine, signals, red lamp and place to turn the engines
round.'Barrington closed the book: 'So you may as well have your things now,'
he continued, speaking in a matter-of-fact tone.'We'll buy them here;
it will save me a lot of work.I shall not have the trouble of taking
them round to where you live.It's lucky I happened to meet you, isn't
it?'The children were breathless with emotion, but they just managed to
gasp out that it was--very lucky.As they followed him into the shop, Freddie was the only one of the
four whose condition was anything like normal.All the others were in
a half-dazed state.Frankie was afraid that he was not really awake at
all.It couldn't be true; it must be a dream.In addition to the hair, the horse was furnished with four wheels.They
did not have it made into a parcel, but tied some string to it and
handed it over to its new owner.The elder children were scarcely
conscious of what took place inside the shop; they knew that Barrington
was talking to the shopman, but they did not hear what was said--the
sound seemed far away and unreal.The shopman made the doll, the tea-set and the needlecase into one
parcel and gave it to Elsie.The railway, in a stout cardboard box,
was also wrapped up in brown paper, and Frankie's heart nearly burst
when the man put the package into his arms.When they came out of the toy shop they said 'Good night' to Frankie,
who went off carrying his parcel very carefully and feeling as if he
were walking on air.The others went into a provision merchant's near
by, where the groceries were purchased and packed into the waggon.Then Barrington, upon referring to the list to make quite certain that
he had not forgotten anything, found that Santa Claus had put down a
pair of boots each for Elsie and Charley, and when they went to buy
these, it was seen that their stockings were all ragged and full of
holes, so they went to a draper's and bought some stocking also.Barrington said that although they were not on the list, he was sure
Santa Claus would not object--he had probably meant them to have them,
but had forgotten to put them down.Chapter 54

The End


The following evening Barrington called at Owen's place.He said he
was going home for the holidays and had come to say goodbye for a time.Owen had not been doing very well during these last few months,
although he was one of the few lucky ones who had had some small share
of work.Most of the money he earned went for rent, to pay which they
often had to go short of food.Lately his chest had become so bad that
the slightest exertion brought on fits of coughing and breathlessness,
which made it almost impossible to work even when he had the
opportunity; often it was only by an almost superhuman effort of will
that he was able to continue working at all.He contrived to keep up
appearances to a certain extent before Rushton, who, although he knew
that Owen was not so strong as the other men, was inclined to overlook
it so long as he was able to do his share of work, for Owen was a very
useful hand when things were busy.But lately some of the men with
whom he worked began to manifest dissatisfaction at having him for a
mate.When two men are working together, the master expects to see two
men's work done, and if one of the two is not able to do his share it
makes it all the harder for the other.He never had the money to go to a doctor to get advice, but earlier in
the winter he had obtained from Rushton a ticket for the local
hospital.Every Saturday throughout the year when the men were paid
they were expected to put a penny or twopence in the hospital box.Contributions were obtained in this way from every firm and workshop in
the town.The masters periodically handed these boxes over to the
hospital authorities and received in return some tickets which they
gave to anyone who needed and asked for them.The employer had to fill
in the ticket or application form with the name and address of the
applicant, and to certify that in his opinion the individual was a
deserving case,'suitable to receive this charity'.In common with the
majority of workmen, Owen had a sort of horror of going for advice to
this hospital, but he was so ill that he stifled his pride and went.It happened that it turned out to be more expensive than going to a
private doctor, for he had to be at the hospital at a certain hour on a
particular morning.To do this he had to stay away from work.The
medicine they prescribed and which he had to buy did him no good, for
the truth was that it was not medicine that he--like thousands of
others--needed, but proper conditions of life and proper food; things
that had been for years past as much out of his reach as if he had been
dying alone in the middle of a desert.Occasionally Nora contrived--by going without some other necessary--to
buy him a bottle of one of the many much-advertised medicines; but
although some of these things were good she was not able to buy enough
for him to derive any benefit from them.Although he was often seized with a kind of terror of the future--of
being unable to work--he fought against these feelings and tried to
believe that when the weather became warmer he would be all right once
more.When Barrington came in Owen was sitting in a deck-chair by the fire in
the sitting-room.He had been to work that day with Harlow, washing off
the ceilings and stripping the old paper from the walls of two rooms in
Rushton's home, and he looked very haggard and exhausted.'I have never told you before,' said Barrington, after they had been
talking for a while, 'but I suppose you have guessed that I did not
work for Rushton because I needed to do so in order to live.I just
wanted to see things for myself; to see life as it is lived by the
majority.He doesn't approve of my
opinions, but at same time he does not interfere with me for holding
them, and I have a fairly liberal allowance which I spent in my own
way.I'm going to pass Christmas with my own people, but in the spring
I intend to fit out a Socialist Van, and then I shall come back here.We'll have some of the best speakers in the movement; we'll hold
meetings every night; we'll drench the town with literature, and we'll
start a branch of the party.'Owen's eye kindled and his pale face flushed.'I shall be able to do something to advertise the meetings,' he said.For instance, I could paint some posters and placards.''And I can help to give away handbills,' chimed in Frankie, looking up
from the floor, where he was seated working the railway.'I know a lot
of boys who'll come along with me to put 'em under the doors as well.'They were in the sitting-room and the door was shut.Mrs Owen was in
the next room with Ruth.While the two men were talking the front-door
bell was heard to ring and Frankie ran out to see who it was, closing
the door after him.Barrington and Owen continued their conversation,
and from time to time they could hear a low murmur of voices from the
adjoining room.After a little while they heard some one go out by the
front door, and almost immediately afterward Frankie--wild with
excitement, burst into the room, crying out:

'Dad and Mr Barrington!And he began capering
gleefully about the room, evidently transported with joy.inquired Barrington, rather mystified
by this extraordinary conduct.'Mr Easton came with Freddie to see Mrs Easton, and she's gone home
again with them,' replied Freddie, 'and--she's given the baby to us for
a Christmas box!'Barrington was already familiar with the fact of Easton's separation
from his wife, and Owen now told him the Story of their reconciliation.His train left at eight;
it was already nearly half past seven, and he said he had a letter to
write.Nora brought the baby in to show him before he went, and then
she helped Frankie to put on his overcoat, for Barrington had requested
that the boy might be permitted to go a little way with him.There was a stationer's shop at the end of the street.He went in here
and bought a sheet of notepaper and an envelope, and, having borrowed
the pen and ink, wrote a letter which he enclosed in the envelope with
the two other pieces that he took out of his pocketbook.Having
addressed the letter he came out of the shop; Frankie was waiting for
him outside.'I want you to take this straight home and give it to your dad.I
don't want you to stop to play or even to speak to anyone till you get
home.''I won't stop running all the way.''I think I have time to
go back with you as far as your front door,' he said, 'then I shall be
quite sure you haven't lost it.'They accordingly retraced their steps and in a few minutes reached the
entrance to the house.Barrington opened the door and stood for a
moment in the hall watching Frankie ascend the stairs.inquired the boy, pausing and
looking over the banisters.'Because we can see the bridge from our front-room window, and if you
were to wave your handkerchief as your train goes over the bridge, we
could wave back.'Barrington waited till he heard Frankie open and close the door of
Owen's flat, and then he hurried away.When he gained the main road he
heard the sound of singing and saw a crowd at the corner of one of the
side-streets.As he drew near he perceived that it was a religious
meeting.There was a lighted lamp on a standard in the centre of the crowd and
on the glass of this lamp was painted: 'Be not deceived: God is not
mocked.'Mr Rushton was preaching in the centre of the ring.He said that they
had come hout there that evening to tell the Glad Tidings of Great Joy
to hall those dear people that he saw standing around.The members of
the Shining Light Chapel--to which he himself belonged--was the
organizers of that meeting but it was not a sectarian meeting, for he
was 'appy to say that several members of other denominations was there
co-operating with them in the good work.As he continued his address,
Rushton repeatedly referred to the individuals who composed the crowd
as his 'Brothers and Sisters' and, strange to say, nobody laughed.Barrington looked round upon the 'Brothers': Mr Sweater, resplendent in
a new silk hat of the latest fashion, and a fur-trimmed overcoat.Mr Bosher, Vicar of the Church of the Whited Sepulchre, Mr
Grinder--one of the churchwardens at the same place of alleged
worship--both dressed in broadcloth and fine linen and glossy silk
hats, while their general appearance testified to the fact that they
had fared sumptuously for many days.Mr Didlum, Mrs Starvem, Mr
Dauber, Mr Botchit, Mr Smeeriton, and Mr Leavit.John Starr, doing the work for which he
was paid.As he stood there in the forefront of this company, there was nothing
in his refined and comely exterior to indicate that his real function
was to pander to and flatter them; to invest with an air of
respectability and rectitude the abominably selfish lives of the gang
of swindlers, slave-drivers and petty tyrants who formed the majority
of the congregation of the Shining Light Chapel.He was doing the work for which he was paid.By the mere fact of his
presence there, condoning and justifying the crimes of these typical
representatives of that despicable class whose greed and inhumanity
have made the earth into a hell.There was also a number of'respectable', well-dressed people who
looked as if they could do with a good meal, and a couple of shabbily
dressed, poverty-stricken-looking individuals who seemed rather out of
place in the glittering throng.The remainder of the Brothers consisted of half-starved, pale-faced
working men and women, most of them dressed in other people's cast-off
clothing, and with broken, patched-up, leaky boots on their feet.Rushton having concluded his address, Didlum stepped forward to give
out the words of the hymn the former had quoted at the conclusion of
his remarks:


        'Oh, come and jine this 'oly band,
        And hon to glory go.'Strange and incredible as it may appear to the reader, although none of
them ever did any of the things Jesus said, the people who were
conducting this meeting had the effrontery to claim to be followers of
Christ--Christians!Jesus said: 'Lay not up for yourselves treasure upon earth', 'Love not
the world nor the things of the world', 'Woe unto you that are rich--it
is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich
man to enter the kingdom of heaven.'Yet all these self-styled
'Followers' of Christ made the accumulation of money the principal
business of their lives.Jesus said: 'Be ye not called masters; for they bind heavy burdens and
grievous to be borne, and lay them on men's shoulders, but they
themselves will not touch them with one of their fingers.For one is
your master, even Christ, and ye are all brethren.'But nearly all
these alleged followers of the humble Workman of Nazareth claimed to be
other people's masters or mistresses.And as for being all brethren,
whilst most of these were arrayed in broadcloth and fine linen and
fared sumptuously every day, they knew that all around them thousands
of those they hypocritically called their 'brethren', men, women and
little children, were slowly perishing of hunger and cold; and we have
already seen how much brotherhood existed between Sweater and Rushton
and the miserable, half-starved wretches in their employment.Whenever they were asked why they did not practise the things Jesus
preached, they replied that it is impossible to do so!They did not
seem to realize that when they said this they were saying, in effect,
that Jesus taught an impracticable religion; and they appeared to
forget that Jesus said, 'Wherefore call ye me Lord, Lord, when ye do
not the things I say?...''Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and
doeth them not, shall be likened to a foolish man who built his house
upon the sand.'But although none of these self-styled 'Followers' of Christ, ever did
the things that Jesus said, they talked a great deal about them, and
sang hymns, and for a pretence made long prayers, and came out here to
exhort those who were still in darkness to forsake their evil ways.And
they procured this lantern and wrote a text upon it: 'Be not deceived,
God is not mocked.'They stigmatized as 'infidels' all those who differed from them,
forgetting that the only real infidels are those who are systematically
false and unfaithful to the Master they pretend to love and serve.Grinder, having a slight cold, had not spoken this evening, but several
other infidels, including Sweater, Didlum, Bosher, and Starr, had
addressed the meeting, making a special appeal to the working people,
of whom the majority of the crowd was composed, to give up all the vain
pleasures of the world in which they at present indulged, and, as
Rushton had eloquently put it at the close of his remarks:

        'Come and jine this 'Oly band and hon to glory go!'As Didlum finished reading out the words, the lady at the harmonium
struck up the tune of the hymns, and the disciples all joined in the
singing:

        'Oh, come and join this 'oly band and hon to glory go.'During the singing certain of the disciples went about amongst the
crowd distributing tracts.Presently one of them offered one to
Barrington and as the latter looked at the man he saw that it was
Slyme, who also recognized him at the same instant and greeted him by
name.Barrington made no reply except to decline the tract:

'I don't want that--from you,' he said contemptuously.'Oh, I know what you're thinking of,' he said after
a pause and speaking in an injured tone; 'but you shouldn't judge
anyone too hard.It wasn't only my fault, and you don't know 'ow much
I've suffered for it.If it 'adn't been for the Lord, I believe I
should 'ave drownded myself.'Barrington made no answer and Slyme slunk off, and when the hymn was
finished Brother Sweater stood forth and gave all those present a
hearty invitation to attend the services to be held during the ensuing
week at the Chapel of the Shining Light.He invited them there
specially, of course, because it was the place with which he was
himself connected, but he entreated and begged of them even if they
would not come there to go Somewhere; there were plenty of other places
of worship in the town; in fact, there was one at the corner of nearly
every street.Those who did not fancy the services at the Shining
Light could go to the Church of the Whited Sepulchre, but he really did
hope that all those dear people whom he saw standing round would go
Somewhere.A short prayer from Bosher closed the meeting, and now the reason for
the presence of the two poverty-stricken-looking shabbily dressed
disciples was made manifest, for while the better dressed and therefore
more respectable Brothers were shaking hands with and grinning at each
other or hovering round the two clergymen and Mr Sweater, these two
poor wretches carried away the harmonium and the lantern, together with
the hymn books and what remained of the tracts.As Barrington hurried
off to catch the train one of the 'Followers' gave him a card which he
read by the light of a street lamp--

                   Come and join the Brotherhood
                    at the Shining Light Chapel
                                PSA
                    Every Sunday at 3 o'clock.'Oh come and join this Holy Band
                        and on to Glory go.'Barrington thought he would, rather go to hell--if there were such a
place--with some decent people, than share 'glory' with a crew like
this.Nora sat sewing by the fireside in the front room, with the baby asleep
in her lap.Owen was reclining in the deck-chair opposite.They had
both been rather silent and thoughtful since Barrington's departure.It was mainly by their efforts that the reconciliation between Easton
and Ruth had been effected and they had been so desirous of
accomplishing that result that they had not given much thought to their
own position.'I feel that I could not bear to part with her for anything now,' said
Nora at last breaking the long silence, 'and Frankie is so fond of her
too.But all the same I can't feel happy about it when I think how ill
you are.''Oh, I shall be all right when the weather gets a little warmer,' said
Owen, affecting a cheerfulness he did not feel.'We have always pulled
through somehow or other; the poor little thing is not going to make
much difference, and she'll be as well off with us as she would have
been if Ruth had not gone back.'As he spoke he leaned over and touched the hand of the sleeping child
and the little fingers closed round one of his with a clutch that sent
a thrill all through him.As he looked at this little helpless,
dependent creature, he realized with a kind of thankfulness that he
would never have the heart to carry out the dreadful project he had
sometimes entertained in hours of despondency.'We've always got through somehow or other,' he repeated, 'and we'll do
so still.'Presently they heard Frankie's footsteps ascending the stairs and a
moment afterwards the boy entered the room.'We have to look out of the window and wave to Mr Barrington when his
train goes over the bridge,' he cried breathlessly.Open the window, quick, Dad, or it may be too late.''There's plenty of time yet,' replied Owen, smiling at the boy's
impetuosity.We don't want the window open
all that time.It's only a quarter to eight by our clock now, and
that's five minutes fast.'However, so as to make quite certain that the train should not run past
unnoticed, Frankie pulled up the blind and, rubbing the steam off the
glass, took up his station at the window to watch for its coming, while
Owen opened the letter:

'Dear Owen,

'Enclosed you will find two bank-notes, one for ten pounds and the
other for five.The first I beg you will accept from me for yourself
in the same spirit that I offer it, and as I would accept it from you
if our positions were reversed.If I were in need, I know that you
would willingly share with me whatever you had and I could not hurt you
by refusing.The other note I want you to change tomorrow morning.Give three pounds of it to Mrs Linden and the remainder to Bert White's
mother.'Wishing you all a happy Xmas and hoping to find you well and eager for
the fray when I come back in the spring,

                             'Yours for the cause,

                                                  'George Barrington.'Owen read it over two or three times before he could properly
understand it and then, without a word of comment--for he could not
have spoken at that moment to save his life--he passed it to Nora, who
felt, as she read it in her turn, as if a great burden had been lifted
from her heart.All the undefined terror of the future faded away as
she thought of all this small piece of paper made possible.Meanwhile, Frankie, at the window, was straining his eyes in the
direction of the station.'Don't you think we'd better have the window open now, Dad?'he said at
last as the clock struck eight.'The steam keeps coming on the glass
as fast as I wipe it off and I can't see out properly.I'm sure it's
nearly time now; p'raps our clock isn't as fast as you think it is.''All right, we'll have it open now, so as to be on the safe side,' said
Owen as he stood up and raised the sash, and Nora, having wrapped the
child up in a shawl, joined them at the window.'It can't be much longer now, you know,' said Frankie.They turned the red light off the signal just before you opened
the window.'In a very few minutes they heard the whistle of the locomotive as it
drew out of the station, then, an instant before the engine itself came
into sight round the bend, the brightly polished rails were
illuminated, shining like burnished gold in the glare of its headlight;
a few seconds afterwards the train emerged into view, gathering speed
as it came along the short stretch of straight way, and a moment later
it thundered across the bridge.It was too far away to recognize his
face, but they saw someone looking out of a carriage window waving a
handkerchief, and they knew it was Barrington as they waved theirs in
return.Soon there remained nothing visible of the train except the
lights at the rear of the guard's van, and presently even those
vanished into the surrounding darkness.The lofty window at which they were standing overlooked several of the
adjacent streets and a great part of the town.On the other side of the
road were several empty houses, bristling with different house agents'
advertisement boards and bills.About twenty yards away, the shop
formerly tenanted by Mr Smallman, the grocer, who had become bankrupt
two or three months previously, was also plastered with similar
decorations.A little further on, at the opposite corner, were the
premises of the Monopole Provision Stores, where brilliant lights were
just being extinguished, for they, like most of the other shops, were
closing their premises for the night, and the streets took on a more
cheerless air as one after another their lights disappeared.It had been a fine day, and during the earlier part of the evening the
moon, nearly at the full, had been shining in a clear and starry sky;
but a strong north-east wind had sprung up within the last hour; the
weather had become bitterly cold and the stars were rapidly being
concealed from view by the dense banks of clouds that were slowly
accumulating overhead.As they remained at the window looking out over this scene for a few
minutes after the train had passed out of sight, it seemed to Owen that
the gathering darkness was as a curtain that concealed from view the
Infamy existing beyond.In every country, myriads of armed men waiting
for their masters to give them the signal to fall upon and rend each
other like wild beasts.All around was a state of dreadful anarchy;
abundant riches, luxury, vice, hypocrisy, poverty, starvation, and
crime.Men literally fighting with each other for the privilege of
working for their bread, and little children crying with hunger and
cold and slowly perishing of want.The gloomy shadows enshrouding the streets, concealing for the time
their grey and mournful air of poverty and hidden suffering, and the
black masses of cloud gathering so menacingly in the tempestuous sky,
seemed typical of the Nemesis which was overtaking the Capitalist
System.That atrocious system which, having attained to the fullest
measure of detestable injustice and cruelty, was now fast crumbling
into ruin, inevitably doomed to be overwhelmed because it was all so
wicked and abominable, inevitably doomed to sink under the blight and
curse of senseless and unprofitable selfishness out of existence for
ever, its memory universally execrated and abhorred.But from these ruins was surely growing the glorious fabric of the
Co-operative Commonwealth.Mankind, awaking from the long night of
bondage and mourning and arising from the dust wherein they had lain
prone so long, were at last looking upward to the light that was riving
asunder and dissolving the dark clouds which had so long concealed from
them the face of heaven.The light that will shine upon the world wide
Fatherland and illumine the gilded domes and glittering pinnacles of
the beautiful cities of the future, where men shall dwell together in
true brotherhood and goodwill and joy.The Golden Light that will be
diffused throughout all the happy world from the rays of the risen sun
of Socialism.Appendix

Mugsborough


Mugsborough was a town of about eighty thousand inhabitants, about two
hundred miles from London.It was built in a verdant valley.Looking
west, north or east from the vicinity of the fountain on the Grand
Parade in the centre of the town, one saw a succession of pine-clad
hills.To the south, as far as the eye could see, stretched a vast,
cultivated plain that extended to the south coast, one hundred miles
away.The climate was supposed to be cool in summer and mild in winter.The town proper nestled in the valley: to the west, the most beautiful
and sheltered part was the suburb of Irene: here were the homes of the
wealthy residents and prosperous tradespeople, and numerous
boarding-houses for the accommodation of well-to-do visitors.East,
the town extended up the <DW72> to the top of the hill and down the
other side to the suburb of Windley, where the majority of the working
classes lived.Years ago, when the facilities for foreign travel were fewer and more
costly, Mugsborough was a favourite resort of the upper classes, but of
late years most of these patriots have adopted the practice of going on
the Continent to spend the money they obtain from the working people of
England.However, Mugsborough still retained some semblance of
prosperity.Summer or winter the place was usually fairly full of what
were called good-class visitors, either holidaymakers or invalids.The
Grand Parade was generally crowded with well-dressed people and
carriages.The shops appeared to be well-patronized and at the time of
our story an air of prosperity pervaded the town.But this fair
outward appearance was deceitful.The town was really a vast whited
sepulchre; for notwithstanding the natural advantages of the place the
majority of the inhabitants existed in a state of perpetual poverty
which in many cases bordered on destitution.One of the reasons for
this was that a great part of the incomes of the tradespeople and
boarding-house-keepers and about a third of the wages of the working
classes were paid away as rent and rates.For years the Corporation had been borrowing money for necessary public
works and improvements, and as the indebtedness of the town increased
the rates rose in proportion, because the only works and services
undertaken by the Council were such as did not yield revenue.Every
public service capable of returning direct profit was in the hands of
private companies, and the shares of the private companies were in the
hands of the members of the Corporation, and the members of the
Corporation were in the hands of the four most able and intellectual of
their number, Councillors Sweater, Rushton, Didlum and Grinder, each of
whom was a director of one or more of the numerous companies which
battened on the town.The Tramway Company, the Water Works Company, the Public Baths Company,
the Winter Gardens Company, the Grand Hotel Company and numerous
others.There was, however, one Company in which Sweater, Rushton,
Didlum and Grinder had no shares, and that was the Gas Company, the
oldest and most flourishing of them all.This institution had grown
with the place; most of the original promoters were dead, and the
greater number of the present shareholders were non-residents; although
they lived on the town, they did not live in it.The profits made by this Company were so great that, being prevented by
law from paying a larger dividend than ten percent, they frequently
found it a difficult matter to decide what to do with the money.They
paid the Directors and principal officials--themselves shareholders, of
course--enormous salaries.They built and furnished costly and
luxurious offices and gave the rest to the shareholders in the form of
Bonuses.There was one way in which the Company might have used some of the
profits: it might have granted shorter hours and higher wages to the
workmen whose health was destroyed and whose lives were shortened by
the terrible labour of the retort-houses and the limesheds; but of
course none of the directors or shareholders ever thought of doing
that.It was not the business of the Company to concern itself about
them.Years ago, when it might have been done for a comparatively small
amount, some hare-brained Socialists suggested that the town should buy
the Gas Works, but the project was wrecked by the inhabitants, upon
whom the mere mention of the word Socialist had the same effect that
the sight of a red rag is popularly supposed to have on a bull.Of course, even now it was still possible to buy out the Company, but
it was supposed that it would cost so much that it was generally
considered to be impracticable.Although they declined to buy the Gas works, the people of Mugsborough
had to buy the gas.The amount paid by the municipality to the Company
for the public lighting of the town loomed large in the accounts of the
Council.With regard to these last, the point on which I
wish chiefly to dwell is the way in which not a few pieces of modern
legislation have been—whether wittingly or unwittingly I do not profess
to know—a return to the simpler principles of our oldest constitution.I trust to show that, in many important points, we have cast aside
the legal subtleties which grew up from the thirteenth century to the
seventeenth, and that we have gone back to the plain common sense of
the eleventh or tenth, and of times far earlier still.In those ancient
times we had already laws, but we had as yet no lawyers.We hear in
early times of men who were versed above others in the laws of the
land; but such special knowledge is spoken of as the attribute of age
or of experience in public business, not as the private possession of
a professional class(12).The class of professional lawyers grew up
along with the growth of a more complicated and technical jurisprudence
under our Norman and Angevin Kings.Now I mean no disrespect to
a profession which in our present artificial state of society we
certainly cannot do without, but there can be no kind of doubt that
lawyers’ interpretations and lawyers’ ways of looking at things have
done no small mischief, not only to the true understanding of our
history but to the actual course of our history itself.The lawyer’s
tendency is to carry to an unreasonable extent that English love of
precedent which, within reasonable bounds, is one of our most precious
safeguards.His virtue is that of acute and logical inference from
given premisses; the premisses themselves he is commonly satisfied to
take without examination from those who have gone before him.It is
often wonderful to see the amazing ingenuity with which lawyers have
piled together inference upon inference, starting from some purely
arbitrary assumption of their own.Each stage of the argument, taken
by itself, is absolutely unanswerable; the objection must be taken
earlier, before the argument begins.The argument is perfect, if we
only admit the premisses; the only unlucky thing is that the premisses
will constantly be found to be historically worthless.Add to this that
the natural tendency of the legal mind is to conservatism and deference
to authority.This will always be the case, even with thoroughly
honest men in an age when honesty is no longer dangerous.But this
tendency will have tenfold force in times when an honest setting forth
of the Law might expose its author to the disfavour of an arbitrary
government.We shall therefore find that the premisses from which
lawyers’ arguments have started, but which historical study shows to be
unsound, are commonly premisses devised in favour of the prerogative
of the Crown, not in favour of the rights of the people.Indeed the
whole ideal conception of the Sovereign, as one, personally at least,
above the Law, as one personally irresponsible and incapable of doing
wrong, the whole conception of the Sovereign as the sole fountain of
all honour, as the original grantor of all property, as the source
from which all authority of every kind issues in the first instance,
is purely a lawyer’s conception, and rests upon no ground whatever in
the records of our early history(13).In later times indeed the evil
has largely corrected itself; the growth of our unwritten Constitution
under the hands of statesmen has done much practically to get rid of
these slavish devices of lawyers.The personal irresponsibility of the
Sovereign becomes practically harmless when the powers of the Crown are
really exercised by Ministers who act under a twofold responsibility,
both to the written Law and to the unwritten Constitution.Yet even
now small cases of hardship sometimes happen in which some traditional
maxim of lawyers, some device devised in favour of the prerogative of
the Crown, stands in the way of the perfectly equal administration
of justice.But in several important cases the lawgiver has directly
stepped in to wipe out the inventions of the lawyer, and modern Acts of
Parliament have brought things back to the simpler principles of our
earliest forefathers.I will wind up my sketch of our constitutional
history by pointing out several cases in which this happy result has
taken place.For many ages it was a legal doctrine universally received that
Parliament at once expired at the death of the reigning King.The
argument by which the lawyers reached this conclusion is, like most of
their arguments, altogether unanswerable, provided only we admit their
premisses.According to the lawyers’ conception, whatever might be the
powers of Parliament when it actually came together, however much the
King might be bound to act by its advice, consent, and authority, the
Parliament itself did nevertheless derive its being from the authority
of the King.Parliament was summoned by the King’s writ.The King
might indeed be bound to issue the writs for its summons; still it was
from the King’s writ that the Parliament actually derived its being
and its powers.By another legal assumption, the force of the King’s
writ was held to last only during the lifetime of the King who issued
it.It followed therefore that Parliament, summoned by the King’s
writ and deriving its authority from the King’s writ, was dissolved
_ipso facto_ by the death of the King who summoned it.Once admit the
assumptions from which this reasoning starts, and the reasoning itself
is perfect.Let us see how
this mass of legal subtlety would have looked in the eyes of a man of
the eleventh century, in the eyes of a man who had borne his part in
the elections of Eadward and of Harold, and who had raised his voice
and clashed his arms in the great Assembly which restored Godwine to
his lands and honours(14).To such an one the doctrine that a national
Assembly could be gathered together only by the King’s writ, and the
consequent doctrine that the national Assembly ceased to exist when the
breath went out of the King’s body, would have seemed like the babble
of a madman.When was the gathering together of the national Assembly
more needed, when was it called upon to exercise higher and more
inherent powers, than when the throne was actually vacant, and when
the Assembly of the nation came together to determine who should fill
it?And how could the Assembly be gathered together by the King’s writ
when there was no King in the land to issue a writ?The King’s writ
would be, in his eyes, a convenient way in ordinary times for fixing
a time and place for the meetings of the Assembly, but it would be
nothing more.It would be in no sense the source of the powers of the
Assembly, powers which he would look upon as derived from the simple
fact that the Assembly was itself the nation.In his eyes it was not
the King who created the Assembly, but the Assembly which created the
King.The doctrine that the King never dies, that the throne never can
be vacant, would have seemed gibberish to one who had seen the throne
vacant and had borne his part in filling it.The doctrine that the
King can do no wrong would have seemed no less gibberish to one who
knew that he might possibly be called on to bear his part in deposing
a King.Three of the most famous Assemblies in English history have
ever been puzzles in the eyes of mere legal interpreters; to the man of
the eleventh century they would have seemed to be perfectly legal and
regular, alike in their constitution and in their acts.The Assembly
which in 1399 deposed Richard the Second and elected Henry the Fourth,
though summoned by the King’s writ, was not opened by his commission,
and it seems to have shrunk from taking the name of Parliament, and to
have acted only by the name of the Estates of the Realm.As an Assembly
which was in some sort irregular, it seems to have shrunk from going
through the usual forms of a regular Parliament, and, though it did
in the end exercise the greatest of parliamentary powers, it seems to
have been afraid to look its own act in the face.Richard was deposed,
but his deposition was mixed up with a resignation of the Crown on
his own part, and with a challenge of the Crown on the part of Henry.Then, as a demise of the Crown had taken place, it was held that the
same legal consequences followed as if that demise had been caused by
the death of the King.It was held that the Parliament which had been
summoned by the writ of King Richard ceased to exist when Richard
ceased to be King, and, as it was not thought good to summon a new
Parliament, the same Parliament was, by a legal fiction, summoned again
under the writ of King Henry(15).All these doubts and difficulties,
all these subtleties of lawyers, would have been wholly unintelligible
to a man of the eleventh century.In his eyes the Witan would have come
together, whether by King Richard’s writ or not it mattered little;
having come together, they had done the two greatest of national acts
by deposing one King and choosing another; having done this, if there
was any other national business to be done, there was no reason on
earth why they should not go on and do it.Take again another Assembly
of equal importance in our history, the Convention which voted the
recall—that is, in truth, the election—of Charles the Second.That
Assembly succeeded a Parliament which had ventured on a still stronger
step than deposing a King, that of sending a reigning King to trial and
execution(16).It was not held in 1649 that the Long Parliament came
to an end when the axe fell on the neck of Charles the First, but the
doctrine that it ought to have done so was not forgotten eleven years
later(17).And the Convention which was elected, as freely as any
Parliament ever was elected(18), in answer to the vote of the expiring
Long Parliament, was, because it was so elected and not in answer to
the King’s writ, looked on as an Assembly of doubtful validity.It
acted as a Parliament; it restored the King; it granted him a revenue;
and it did a more wonderful work than all, for it created itself, and
passed an Act declaring itself to be a lawful Parliament(19).Yet,
after all, it was deemed safer that all the Acts of the Convention
Parliament should be confirmed by its successor which was summoned in
due form by the King’s writ.These fantastic subtleties, subtleties
worthy of the kindred device by which the first year of Charles’s reign
was called the twelfth, would again have been wholly unintelligible
to our man of the eleventh century.He might have remembered that the
Assembly which restored Æthelred—which restored him on conditions,
while Charles was restored without conditions—did not scruple to go on
and pass a series of the most important decrees that were passed in
any of our early Assemblies(20).Once more again, the Convention which
deposed James and elected William, seemed, like that which deposed
Richard and elected Henry, to doubt its own existence and to shrink
from its own act.James was deposed; but the Assembly which deposed
him ventured not to use the word, and, as an extorted abdication was
deemed expedient in the case of Richard, so a constructive abdication
was imagined in the case of James(21).And the Assembly which elected
William, like the Assembly which elected Henry and that which elected
Charles, prolonged its own existence by the same transparent fiction
of voting itself to be a lawful Parliament.Wise men held at the time
that, at least in times of revolution, a Parliament might be called
into being by some other means than that of the writ of a King.Yet it
was deemed that some additional security was given to the existence of
the Assembly and to the validity of its acts by this second exercise
of the mysterious power of self-creation(22).Once more in the same
reign the question was brought forward whether a Parliament summoned
by the joint writ of William and Mary did not expire when Mary died
and William reigned alone.This subtlety was suggested only to be
contemptuously cast aside; yet it may be fairly doubted whether it was
not worth at least as much as any of the kindred subtleties which on
the three earlier occasions were deemed of such vast importance(23).The untutored wisdom of Englishmen, in the days when we had laws but
when those laws had not yet been made the sport of the subtleties of
lawyers, would have seen as little force in the difficulties which it
was deemed necessary to get over by solemn parliamentary enactments as
in the difficulty which neither House of Parliament thought worthy of
any serious discussion.And now what has modern legislation done towards getting rid of all
these pettifogging devices, and towards bringing us back to the simpler
doctrines of our forefathers?Parliament is still summoned by the
writ of the Sovereign; in settled times no other way of bringing it
together can be so convenient.But, if times of revolution should ever
come again, we, who do even our revolutions according to precedent,
shall probably have learned something from the revolutionary precedents
of 1399, of 1660, and of 1688.In each later case the subtlety is
one degree less subtle than in the former.The Estates of the Realm
which deposed Richard were changed into a Parliament of Henry by the
transparent fiction of sending out writs which were not, and could not
be, followed by any real elections.The Convention which recalled or
elected Charles the Second did indeed turn itself into a Parliament,
but it was deemed needful that its acts should be confirmed by another
Parliament.The acts of the Convention of 1688 were not deemed to need
any such confirmation.Each of these differences marks a stage in the
return to the doctrine of common sense, that, convenient as it is in
all ordinary times that Parliament should be summoned by the writ of
the Sovereign, yet it is not from that summons, but from the choice of
the people, that Parliament derives its real being and its inherent
powers.As for the other end of the lawyers’ doctrine, the inference
that Parliament is _ipso facto_ dissolved by a demise of the Crown,
from that a more rational legislation has set us free altogether.Though modern Parliaments are no longer called on to elect Kings, yet
experience and common sense have taught us that the time when the
Sovereign is changed is exactly the time when the Great Council of
the Nation ought to be in full life and activity.By a statute only a
few years later than the raising of the question whether a Parliament
of William and Mary did or did not expire by the death of Mary, all
such subtleties were swept away.It was now deemed so needful that the
new Sovereign should have a Parliament ready to act with him, that it
became the Law that the Parliament which was in being at the time of
a demise of the Crown should remain in being for six months, unless
specially dissolved by the new Sovereign.A later statute went further
still, and provided that, if a demise of the Crown should take place
during the short interval when there is no Parliament in being, the
last Parliament should _ipso facto_ revive, and should continue in
being, unless a second time dissolved, for six months more.Thus the
event which, by the perverted ingenuity of lawyers, was held to have
the power of destroying a Parliament, was, by the wisdom of later
legislation, clothed with the power of calling a Parliament into being.Lastly, in our own days, all traces of the lawyers’ superstition have
been swept away, and the demise of the Crown now in no way affects the
duration of the existing Parliament(24).Truly this is a case where
the letter killeth and the spirit giveth life.The doctrine which had
been inferred by unanswerable logic from an utterly worthless premiss
has been cast aside in favour of the dictate of common sense.We have
learned that the moment when the State has lost its head is the last
moment which we ought to choose for depriving it of its body also.Here then is a notable instance of the way in which the latest
legislation of England has fallen back upon the principles of the
earliest.Here is a point on which the eleventh century and the
nineteenth are of one mind, and on which the fanciful scruples of the
fourteenth and the seventeenth centuries are no longer listened to.In the old Teutonic Constitution, just as in
the old Roman Constitution, large tracts of land were the property of
the State, the _ager publicus_ of Rome, the _folkland_ of England.As
the royal power grew, as the King came to be more and more looked on
as the impersonation of the nation, the land of the people came to be
more and more looked on as the land of the King, and the _folkland_
of our Old-English charters gradually changed into the _Terra Regis_
of Domesday(25).Like other changes of the kind, the Norman Conquest
only strengthened and brought to its full effect a tendency which was
already at work; but there can be no doubt that, down to the Norman
Conquest, the King at least went through the form of consulting his
Witan, before he alienated the land of the people to become the
possession of an individual—in Old-English phrase, before he turned
_folkland_ into _bookland_(26).After the Norman Conquest we hear no
more of the land of the people; it has become the land of the King, to
be dealt with according to the King’s personal pleasure.From the days
of the first William to those of the Third, the land which had once
been the land of the people was dealt with without any reference to
the will of the people.Under a conscientious King it might be applied
to the real service of the State, or bestowed as the reward of really
faithful servants of the State.Under an unconscientious King it might
be squandered broadcast among his minions or his mistresses(27).A custom as strong as law now requires
that, at the beginning of each fresh reign, the Sovereign shall, not
by an act of bounty but by an act of justice, give back to the nation
the land which the nation lost so long ago.The royal demesnes are now
handed over to be dealt with like the other revenues of the State, to
be disposed of by Parliament for the public service(28).That is to
say, the people have won back their own; the usurpation of the days of
foreign rule has been swept away.We have in this case too gone back
to the sound principles of our forefathers; the _Terra Regis_ of the
Norman has once more become the _folkland_ of the days of our earliest
freedom.I will quote another case, a case in which the return from the
fantasies of lawyers to the common sense of antiquity has been
distinctly to the profit, if not of the abstraction called the Crown,
yet certainly to that of its personal holder.As long as the _folkland_
remained the land of the people, as long as our monarchy retained
its ancient elective character, the King, like any other man, could
inherit, purchase, bequeath, or otherwise dispose of, the lands which
were his own private property as much as the lands of other men were
theirs.We have the wills of several of our early Kings which show that
a King was in this respect as free as any other man(29).But as the
lawyers’ figment of hereditary right took root, as the other lawyers’
figment also took root by which the lands of the people were held to
be at the personal disposal of the King, a third figment grew up, by
which it was held that the person and the office of the King were so
inseparably fused into one that any private estates which the King held
before his accession to the throne became _ipso facto_ part and parcel
of the royal demesne.As long as the Crown remained an elective office,
the injustice of such a rule would have made itself plain; it would
have been at once seen to be as unreasonable as if it had been held
that the private estates of a Bishop should merge in the estates of
his see.As long as there was no certainty that the children or other
heirs of the reigning King would ever succeed to his Crown, it would
have been the height of injustice to deprive them in this way of their
natural inheritance.The election of a King would have carried with
it the confiscation of his private estate.But when the Crown was held
to be hereditary, when the _folkland_ was held to be _Terra Regis_,
this hardship was no longer felt.The eldest son was provided for by
his right of succession to the Crown, and the power of disposing of the
Crown lands at pleasure gave the King the means of providing for his
younger children.Still the doctrine was none the less unreasonable;
it was a doctrine founded on no ground either of natural justice or of
ancient law; it was a mere inference which had gradually grown up out
of mere arbitrary theories about the King’s powers and prerogatives.And, as the old state of things gradually came back again, as men
began to feel that the demesnes of the Crown were not the private
possession of the reigning King, but were the true possession of the
people—that is, as the _Terra Regis_ again came back to its old state
of _folkland_—it was felt to be unreasonable to shut out the Sovereign
from a natural right which belonged to every one of his subjects.The
land which, to put it in the mildest form, the King held in trust for
the common service of the nation was now again employed to its proper
use.It was therefore reasonable that a restriction which belonged
to a past state of things should be swept away, and that Sovereigns
who had given up an usurped power which they ought never to have held
should be restored to the enjoyment of a natural right which ought
never to have been taken from them.As our present Sovereign in so many
other respects holds the place of Ælfred rather than the place of the
Richards and Henries of later times, so she again holds the right which
Ælfred held, of acquiring and disposing of private property like any
other member of the nation(30).These examples are, I hope, enough to make out my case.In each of them
modern legislation has swept away the arbitrary inferences of lawyers,
and has gone back to those simpler principles which the untutored
wisdom of our forefathers never thought of calling in question.I
could easily make the list much longer.Every act which has restrained
the arbitrary prerogative of the Crown, every act which has secured
or increased either the powers of Parliament or the liberty of the
subject, has been a return, sometimes to the letter, at all times to
the spirit, of our earliest Law.But I would enlarge on one point
only, the most important point of all, and a point in which we may
at first sight seem, not to have come nearer, but to have gone away
further from the principles of early times.I mean with regard to the
succession to the Crown.The Crown was of old, as I have already said,
elective.No man had a right to become King till he had been called
to the kingly office by the choice of the Assembly of the nation.No
man actually was King till he had been admitted to the kingly office
by the consecration of the Church.The doctrines that the King never
dies, that the throne never can be vacant, that there can be no
interregnum, that the reign of the next heir begins the moment the
reign of his predecessor is ended, are all figments of later times.No signs of such doctrines can be found at any time earlier than the
accession of Edward the First(31).The strong preference which in early
times belonged to members of the kingly house, above all to the born
son of a crowned King(32), gradually grew, under the influences which
the Norman Conquest finally confirmed, into the doctrine of absolute
hereditary right.That doctrine grew along with the general growth of
the royal power; it grew as men gradually came to look on kingship as
a possession held by a single man for his own profit, rather than as
an office bestowed by the people for the common good of the realm.It
might seem that, in this respect at least, we have not gone forward,
but that we rather have gone back.For nothing is more certain than
that the Crown is more strictly and undoubtedly hereditary now than it
was in the days of Normans, Angevins, or Tudors.But a little thought
will show that in this case also, we have not gone back but have gone
forward.That is to say, we have gone forward by going back, by going
back, in this case, not to the letter, but assuredly to the spirit of
earlier times.The Crown is now more undoubtedly hereditary than it
was in the fifteenth or sixteenth century; but this is because it is
now hereditary by Law, because its powers are distinctly defined by
Law.The will of the people, the source of all Law and of all power,
has been exercised, not in the old form of personally choosing a King
at every vacancy of the Crown, but by an equally lawful exercise of
the national will, which has thought good to entail the Crown on a
particular family.It was in the reign of our last elective King that the Crown first
became legally hereditary.The doctrine may seem a startling one, but
it is one to which an unbiassed study of our history will undoubtedly
lead us.Few things are more amusing than the treatment which our early
history has met with at the hands of purely legal writers.There is
something almost pitiable in the haltings and stumblings of such a
writer as Blackstone, unable to conceive that his lawyer’s figment
of hereditary right was anything short of eternal, and yet coming at
every moment across events which showed that in early times all such
figments were utterly unknown(33).In early times the King was not
only elected, but he went through a twofold election.I have already
said that the religious character with which most nations have thought
good to clothe their Kings took in England, as in most other Christian
lands, the form of an ecclesiastical consecration to the kingly office.That form we still retain; but in modern times it has become a mere
form, a pageant impressive no doubt and instructive, but still a mere
pageant, which gives the crowned King no powers which he did not
equally hold while still uncrowned.The death of the former King at
once puts his successor in possession of every kingly right and power;
his coronation in no way adds to his legal authority, however much it
may add to his personal responsibility towards God and his people.But
this was not so of old time.The choice of the national Assembly gave
the King so chosen the sole right to become King, but it did not make
him King.The King-elect was like a Bishop-elect.The recommendation
of the Crown, the election of the Chapter, and the confirmation of the
Archbishop, give a certain man the sole right to a certain see, but
it is only the purely religious rite of consecration which makes him
actually Bishop of it(34).The choice
of the Witan made him King-elect, but it was only the ecclesiastical
crowning and anointing which made him King.And this ecclesiastical
ceremony involved a further election.Chosen already to the civil
office by the Nation in its civil character, he was again chosen by
the Church—that is, by the Nation in its religious character, by the
Clergy and People assembled in the church where the crowning rite was
to be done(35).This second ecclesiastical election must always have
been a mere form, as the choice of the nation was already made before
the ecclesiastical ceremony began.But the ecclesiastical election
survived the civil one.The state of things which lawyers dream of
from the beginning is a law of strict hereditary succession, broken
in upon by occasional interruptions.These interruptions, which, in
the eye of history, are simply exercises of an ancient right, are, in
the eyes of lawyers, only revolutions or usurpations.But this state
of things, a state in which a fixed rule was sometimes broken, which
Blackstone dreams of in the tenth and eleventh centuries, really did
exist from the thirteenth century onwards.From the accession of
Edward the First, the first King who reigned before his coronation,
hereditary succession became the rule in practice.The son, or even the
grandson, of the late King(36) was commonly acknowledged as a matter
of course, without anything which could fairly be called an election.But the right of Parliament to settle the succession was constantly
exercised, and ever and anon we come across signs which show that
the ancient notion of an election of a still more popular kind had
not wholly passed away out of men’s minds.Two Kings were formally
deposed, and on the deposition of the second the Crown passed, as
it might have done in ancient times, to a branch of the royal house
which was not the next in lineal succession.Three Kings of the House
of Lancaster reigned by a good parliamentary title, and the doctrine
of indefeasible hereditary right, the doctrine that there was some
virtue in a particular line of succession which the power of Parliament
itself could not set aside, was first brought forward as the formal
justification of the claims of the House of York(37).Those claims
in truth could not be formally justified on any showing but that of
the most slavish doctrine of divine right, but it was not on any such
doctrine as that that the cause of the House of York really rested.The elaborate list of grandmothers and great-grandmothers which was
brought forward to show that Henry the Fifth was an usurper would never
have been heard of if the government of Henry the Sixth had not become
utterly unpopular, while Richard Duke of York was the best beloved man
of his time.Richard accepted a parliamentary compromise, which of
course implied the right of Parliament to decide the question.Henry
was to keep the Crown for life, and Richard was to displace Henry’s
son as heir-apparent.That is to say, according to a custom common in
Germany, though rare in England, Richard was chosen to fill a vacancy
in the throne which had not yet taken place(38).Duke Richard fell at
Wakefield; in the Yorkist reading of the Law the Crown was presently
forfeited by Henry, and Edward, the heir of York, had his claim
acknowledged by a show of popular election which carries us back to
far earlier times.The claim of Richard the Third, whatever we make
of it on other grounds, was acknowledged in the like sort by what had
at least the semblance of a popular Assembly(39).In short, though
the hereditary principle had now taken firm root, though the disputes
between the pretenders to the Crown were mainly disputes as to the
right of succession, yet the remembrance of the days when the Crown
had been truly the gift of the people had not wholly passed away.The last King who could bring even the shadow of a claim to have
been chosen by the voice of the people beneath the canopy of heaven
was no other than Richard the Third.The last King who could bring
a better claim to have been chosen by the same voice beneath the
vault of the West Minster was no other than Henry the Eighth.Down to
his time the old ecclesiastical form of choosing the King remained
in the coronation-service, and it was not wholly out of character
that Henry should issue a _congé d’élire_ for his own election.The
device for Henry’s coronation survives in his own handwriting, and,
while it contains a strong assertion of his hereditary right, it also
contains a distinct provision for his election by the people in ancient
form(40).The claim of Henry was perfectly good, for a Parliament of
his father’s reign had declared that the Crown should abide in Henry
the Seventh and the heirs of his body(41).But it was in his case that
the hereditary and parliamentary claim was confirmed by the ancient
rite of ecclesiastical election for the last time in our history.His
successor was not thus distinctly chosen.This was perhaps, among
other reasons, because in his case the form was specially needless.For the right of Edward the Sixth to succeed his father was beyond
all dispute.By an exercise of parliamentary power, which we may well
deem strange, but which was none the less lawful, Henry had been
entrusted with the power of bequeathing and entailing the Crown as he
thought good.That power he exercised on behalf of his own children in
order, and, failing them and their issue, on the issue of his younger
sister(42).Edward, Mary, Elizabeth, therefore all reigned lawfully by
virtue of their father’s will.A moment’s thought will show that Mary
and Elizabeth could not both reign lawfully according to any doctrine
of hereditary succession.On no theory, Catholic or Protestant, could
both be the legitimate daughters of Henry.Parliament indeed had
declared both to be illegitimate; on any theory one or the other must
have been so(43).But each reigned by a perfectly lawful title, under
the provisions of the Act which empowered their father to settle the
succession according to his pleasure.While Elizabeth reigned, almost
divine as she might be deemed to be in her own person, it was at
least not held that there was any divine right in any other person to
succeed her.The doctrine which came into vogue under her successors
was in her day looked upon as treasonable(44).Elizabeth knew where
her strength lay, and the Stewarts knew where their strength, such
as it was, lay also.In the eye of the Law the first Stewart was an
usurper; he occupied the Crown in the teeth of an Act of Parliament
still in force, though he presently procured a fresh Act to salve
over his usurpation(45).There can be no doubt that, on the death of
Elizabeth, the lawful right to the Crown lay in the house of Suffolk,
the descendants of Henry’s younger sister Mary.But the circumstances
of the time were unfavourable to their claims; by a tacit agreement,
politically convenient, but quite in the teeth of the existing Law, the
Crown silently passed to the King of Scots, the descendant of Henry’s
elder sister Margaret.She had not been named in Henry’s entail; her
descendants therefore, lineal heirs of William and Cerdic as they were,
had no legal claim to the Crown beyond what was given them by the Act
of Parliament which was passed after James was already in possession.They were therefore driven, like the Yorkists at an earlier time, to
patch up the theory of the divine right of hereditary succession, in
order to justify an occupation of the throne which had nothing to
justify it in English Law(46).On one memorable day a Stewart King was reminded that an English King
received his right to reign from the will of the English people.Whatever else we may say of the nature or the acts of the tribunal
before which Charles the First was arraigned, it did but assert the
ancient Law of England when it told how “Charles Stewart was admitted
King of England, and therein trusted with a limited power, to govern
by and according to the laws of the land and not otherwise.” It did
but assert a principle which had been acted on on fitting occasions
for nine hundred years, when it told its prisoner that “all his
predecessors and he were responsible to the Commons of England.”
Forgetful of the fate of Sigeberht and Æthelred, of Edward and of
Richard, Charles ventured to ask for precedents, and told his judges
that “the Kingdom of England was hereditary and not successive”(47).After a season, the intruding dynasty passed away, on that great day
when the English people exercised for the last time its ancient right
of deposing and electing Kings.The Convention of which we have so
often spoken, that great Assembly, irregular in the eyes of lawyers,
but in truth all the more lawful because no King’s writ had summoned
it, cast all fantasies and subtleties to the winds by declaring that
the throne was vacant.A true Assembly of the nation once more put
forth its greatest power, and chose William of Orange, as, six hundred
years before, another Assembly of the nation had chosen Harold the
son of Godwine.The cycle had come round, and the English people had
won back again the rights which their fathers had brought with them
from their old home beyond the sea.Nor was it without fitness that
their choice went back to those kindred lands, and that a new William
crossed the sea to undo, after so many ages, the wrongs which England
had suffered from his namesake.And now, under the rule of an elective
King, England could at last afford to make her Crown strictly and
permanently hereditary.The Act of Settlement, as we all know, entailed
the Crown on the Electress Sophia and her heirs(48).Therefore no
Kings have ever reigned by a better right than those who, by virtue
of that Act, have been called to reign by the direct operation of the
Law.They are in truth Kings—_Cyningas_ in the most ancient sense—whose
power flows directly from the will of the nation.In the existing state
of our institutions, the hereditary character of our modern kingship
is no falling away from ancient principles; it in truth allows us
to make a fuller application of them in another shape.In an early
state of things no form of government is so natural as that which
we find established among our forefathers.A feeling which was not
wholly sentimental demanded that the King should, under all ordinary
circumstances, be the descendant of former Kings.But a sense that
some personal qualification was needed in a ruler required that the
electors should have the right of freely choosing within the royal
house.In days when Kings governed as well as reigned, such a choice,
made with some regard to the personal qualities of the King chosen, was
the best means for securing freedom and good government.Under the rule
of a conventional constitution, when Kings reign but do not govern,
when it is openly professed in the House of Commons that it is to that
House that the powers of government have passed(49), the objects
which were once best secured by making kingship elective are now best
secured by making kingship hereditary.It is as the Spartan King said:
by lessening the powers of the Crown, its possession has become more
lasting(50).A political system like ours would be inconsistent with
an elective kingship.An elective King could not be trusted simply to
reign; he would assuredly govern, or try to govern.We need not suppose
that he would attempt any breaches of the written Law.But those powers
which the written Law attaches to the Crown he would assuredly try to
exercise according to his own personal views of what was right and
expedient.And he would assuredly be justified in so doing.For the
personal choice of a certain man to be King would in all reason be held
to imply that he was personally fit for the work of government.He
would be a President or Prime Minister chosen for life, one whom there
would be no means of removing from office except by the most extreme
and most unusual exercise of the powers of Parliament.There are states
of society in which an elective Monarchy is a better kind of government
than either a Commonwealth or an hereditary Monarchy.But, under the
present circumstances of the civilized states of Europe and America,
the choice lies between the hereditary Monarchy and the Commonwealth.The circumstances of our history have made us an hereditary Monarchy,
just as the circumstances of the history of Switzerland have made that
country a Federal Commonwealth.And no reasonable person will seek to
disturb an institution which, like other English institutions, has
grown up because it was wanted(51).Our unwritten Constitution, which
gives us an hereditary Sovereign, but which requires his government to
be carried on by Ministers who are practically chosen by the House of
Commons, does in effect attain the same objects which were sought to
be attained by the elective kingship of our forefathers.Our system
gives the State a personal chief, a personal embodiment of the national
being, which draws to itself those feelings of personal homage and
personal duty which a large class of mankind find it hard to look
upon as due to the more abstract ideas of Law and Commonwealth.And,
when the duties of constitutional royalty are discharged as our own
experience tells us that they may be discharged, the feeling awakened
is more than a mere sentiment; it is a rational feeling of genuine
personal respect.But widely as the hereditary kingship of our latest
times differs in outward form from the hereditary kingship of our
earliest times, the two have points of likeness which are not shared by
kingship in the form which it took in the ages between the two.In our
earliest and in our latest system, the King exists for the sake of the
people; in the intermediate times it sometimes seemed that the people
existed for the sake of the King.In our earliest and in our latest
system, the King is clothed with an office, the duties of which are to
be discharged for the common good of all.In the intermediate times it
sometimes seemed as if the King had been made master of a possession
which was to be enjoyed for his personal pleasure and profit.In the
intermediate times we constantly hear of the rights and powers of the
Crown as something distinct from, and almost hostile to, the common
rights of the people.In our earliest and in our latest times, the
rights of the Crown and the rights of the people are the same, for it
is allowed that the powers of the Crown are to be exercised for the
welfare of the people by the advice and consent of the people or their
representatives.Without indulging in any Utopian dreams, without
picturing to ourselves the England of a thousand years back as an
earthly paradise, the voice of sober history does assuredly teach us
that those distant times have really much in common with our own, much
in which we are really nearer to them than to times which, in a mere
reckoning of years, are far less distant from us.Thus it is that the
cycle has come round, that the days of foreign rule have been wiped
out, and that England is England once again.Our present Sovereign
reigns by as good a right as Ælfred or Harold, for she reigns by the
same right by which they reigned, by the will of the people, embodied
in the Act of Parliament which made the crown of Ælfred and Harold
hereditary in her ancestress.And, reigning by the same right by which
they reigned, she reigns also for the same ends, for the common good
of the nation of which the Law has made her the head.And we can
wish nothing better for her kingdom than that the Crown which she so
lawfully holds, which she has so worthily worn among two generations
of her people, she may, like Nestor of old, continue to wear amid the
well-deserved affection of a third(52).(1) What I say of Uri and the other democratic Cantons must not be
misunderstood, as if I all accepted the now exploded dreams which
made out the _Waldstädte_ or Forest Cantons to have had some special
origin, and some special independence, apart from the rest of Germany.The researches of modern scholars have shown, not only that the
Forest Cantons were members of the Empire like their neighbours, but
that various lesser lords, spiritual and temporal, held different
rights within them.Their acquisition of perfect independence, even
their deliverance from other lords and promotion to the state of
_Reichsunmittelbarkeit_ or immediate dependence on the Empire, was a
work of time.Thus Uri itself, or part of it, was granted in 853 by
Lewis the German to the Abbey of Nuns (_Fraumünster_) in Zürich, and
it was not till 1231 that its independence of any lord but the Emperor
was formally acknowledged.But the universal supremacy of the Empire
in no way interfered with the internal constitution of any district,
city, or principality; nor was such interference necessarily implied
even in subjection to some intermediate lord.The rule of a female
monastery especially would be very light.And from the earliest times
we find both the men of Uri in general and the men of particular parts
of the district (_Gemeinden_, _Communes_, or parishes) spoken of as
communities capable of acting together, and even of treating with those
who claimed to be their masters.(“Nos inhabitantes Uroniam” appear in
a deed of 955 as capable of making an agreement with the officer of the
Abbey at Zürich.)All this is in no way peculiar to the Forest Cantons;
it is no more than what we find everywhere; what is peculiar is that,
whereas elsewhere the old local communities gradually died out, in the
Forest Cantons they lived and flourished, and gained new rights and
powers till they grew into absolutely independent commonwealths.I
think therefore that I have a right to speak of the democracy of Uri as
immemorial.It is not immemorial in its fully developed shape, but that
fully developed shape grew step by step out of earlier forms which are
strictly immemorial and common to the whole Teutonic race.On the early history of the democratic Cantons, a subject than which
none has been more thoroughly misunderstood, I am not able to point
to any one trustworthy work in English.Among the writings of Swiss
scholars—shut up for the most part from readers of other nations in the
inaccessible Transactions of local Societies—there is a vast literature
on the subject, of the whole of which I am far from pretending to be
master.But I may refer to the _Essai sur l’Etat des Personnes et la
Condition des Terres dans le Pays d’Ury au XIIIe Siècle_, by the Baron
Frederick de Gingins-la-Sarraz, in the _Archiv für schweizerische
Geschichte_, i.J. R. Burckhardt’s _Untersuchungen über
die erste Bevölkerung des Alpengebirgs_ in the same collection, iv.3; to the early chapters of the great work of Bluntschli, _Geschichte
des schweizerischen Bundesrechtes_ (Zürich, 1849), and of Blumer’s
_Staats-und Rechtsgeschichte der schweizerischen Demokratien_ (St.Alfons Huber, _Die Waldstaette_ (Innsbruck,
1861), and Dr.Wilhelm Vischer, _Die Sage von der Befreiung der
Waldstädte_ (Leipzig, 1867).H. von Liebenau, in _Die Tell-Sage
zu dem Jahre_ 1230, takes a line of his own.The results of the
whole inquiry will be found in the most accessible form in M. Albert
Rilliet’s _Les Origines de la Confédération Suisse_ (Genève et Bâle,
1868).(2) Individual Swiss mercenaries may doubtless still be found in
foreign armies, as Italy some years back knew to her cost.But the
Federal Constitution of 1848 altogether swept away the system of
military capitulations which used to be publicly entered into by the
Cantons.(3) See Johannes von Müller, _Geschichte der schweizerische
Eidgenossenschaft_, Book v., c.25, of his _sämmtliche
Werke_, Stuttgart und Tübingen, 1832, and the note in vol.14;
or the French translation, vol.The description in Peterman Etterlin’s Chronicle, p.204 (Basel, 1752),
is worth quoting in the original.“Dann do der Hertzog von Burgunn
gesach den züg den berg ab züchen, schein die sunn gerad in sy, und
glitzet als wie ein spiegel, des gelichen lüyet das horn von Ury,
auch die harschorne von Lutzern, und was ein sölich toffen, das des
Hertzogen von Burgunn lüt ein grusen darab entpfiengent, und trattent
hinder sich.”

(4) The magistrates rode when I was present at the Landesgemeinden of
1863 and 1864.I trust that so good a custom has not passed away.(5) On the character and position of Phôkiôn, see Grote, xi.481; and on the general question of the alleged fickleness of the
Athenian people, see iv.(6) Some years ago I went through all the elections to the _Bundesrath_
or Executive Council in Switzerland, and found that in eighteen years
it had only twice happened that a member of the Council seeking
reelection had failed to obtain it.I therefore think that I was
right in congratulating a member of the Federal Council, whom I had the
pleasure of meeting last year, on being a member of the most permanent
government in Europe.(7) Under the so-called Helvetic Republic of 1798, the Cantons ceased
to be sovereign States, and became mere divisions, like counties or
departments.One of the earliest provisions of this constitution
abolishes the ancient democracies of the Forest Cantons.“Die
Regierungsform, wenn sie auch sollte verändert werden, soll allezeit
eine repräsentative Demokratie sein.” (See the text in Bluntschli, ii.The “repräsentative Demokratie” thus forced on these ancient
commonwealths by the sham democrats of Paris was meant to exclude the
pure democracy of Athens and Uri.The Federal system was in some sort restored by the Act of Mediation
(_Vermittlungsakte_) of Napoleon Buonaparte, when First Consul in 1803.See the text in Bluntschli, ii.(8) Appenzell, though its history had long been connected with that
of the Confederates, was not actually admitted as a Canton till
December 1513, being the youngest of the thirteen Cantons which
formed the Confederation down to 1798.See Zellweger, _Geschichte des
Appenzellischen Volkes_, ii.366, and the text in his _Urkunden_,
ii.481, or in the older _Appenzeller Chronick_ of
Walser (Saint Gallen, 1740), 410, and the Act in his _Anhang_, p.The frontispiece of this volume contains a lively picture of
a _Landesgemeinde_.In 1597 the Canton was divided into the two
Half-cantons of _Ausser-Rhoden_, Protestant, and _Inner-Rhoden_,
Catholic.(9) On armed assemblies see Norman Conquest, ii.(10) I perhaps need hardly insist on this point after the references
given in my first note; but I find it constantly needful to explain
that there is no such thing as a Swiss _nation_ in any but a political
sense.The Cantons were simply members of the Empire which gradually
won a greater independence than their fellows.And the Forest Cantons,
and the German-speaking Swiss generally, do not even form a distinct
part of the German nation; they are simply three settlements of the
Alemanni, just as the three divisions of Lincolnshire are three
settlements of the Angles.(11) The earliest instance that I know of the use of the word
_Englaland_ is in the Treaty with Olaf and Justin in 991.Its earliest
use in the English Chronicles is in 1014.78, 276, 605, 629.The oldest use that I know of the name Yorkshire
(_Eoforwicscír_) is in the Chronicles under 1065.Deira is, of course, as old as Gregory the Great’s pun.(12) The real history of English parishes has yet to be worked out.I
feel sure that they will be found to have much more in common with the
continental _Gemeinden_ than would seem at first sight.Some hints may
be found in a little pamphlet which I lately came across, called “The
Parish in History.”

(13) The nature of democracy is set forth by Periklês in the Funeral
Oration, Thucydides, ii.37: ὄνομα μὲν διὰ τὸ μὴ ἐς ὀλίγους ἀλλ' ἐς
πλείονας οἰκεῖν δημοκρατία κέκληται· μέτεστι δὲ κατὰ μὲν τοὺς νόμους
πρὸς τὰ ἴδια διάφορα πᾶσι τὸ ἴσον, κατὰ δὲ τὴν ἀξίωσιν ὡς ἕκαστος
ἐν τῷ εὐδοκιμεῖ.It is set forth still more clearly by Athênagoras
of Syracuse, vi.39, where the functions of different classes in a
democracy are clearly distinguished: ἐγὼ δέ φημι πρῶτα μὲν δῆμον
ξύμπαν ὠνομάσθαι, ὀλιγαρχίαν δὲ μέρος, ἔπειτα φύλακας μὲν ἀρίστους
εἶναι χρημάτων τοὺς πλουσίους, βουλεῦσαι δ' ἂν βέλτιστα τοὺς ξυνετοὺς,
κρῖναι δ' ἂν ἀκούσαντας ἄριστα τοὺς πολλοὺς, καὶ ταῦτα ὁμοίως καὶ κατὰ
μέρη καὶ ξύμπαντα ἐν δημοκρατίᾳ ἰσομοιρεῖν.Here a distinct sphere
is assigned both to wealth and to special intelligence.Nearly the
same division is drawn by a writer who might by comparison be called
aristocratic.29) holds that the management of public
affairs should be immediately in the hands of the men of wealth and
leisure, who should act as servants of the People, the People itself
being their master—or, as he does not scruple to say, _Tyrant_—with
full power of reward and punishment: ἐκεῖνοι διεγνωκότες ἦσαν ὅτι δεῖ
τὸν μὲν δῆμον ὥσπερ τύραννον καθιστάναι τὰς ἀρχὰς καὶ κολάζειν τοὺς
ἐξαμαρτάνοντας καὶ κρίνειν περὶ τῶν ἀμφισβητουμένων, τοὺς δὲ σχολὴν
ἄγειν δυναμένους καὶ βίον ἱκανὸν κεκτημένους ἐπιμελεῖσθαι τῶν κοινῶν
ὥσπερ οἰκέτας, καὶ δικαίους μὲν γενομένους ἐπαινεῖσθαι καὶ στέργειν
ταύτῃ τῇ τιμῇ, κακῶς δὲ διοικήσαντας μηδεμιᾶς συγγνώμης τυγχάνειν,
ἀλλὰ ταῖς μεγίσταις ζημίαις περιπίπτειν.This he elsewhere (Panath
166) calls democracy with a mixture of aristocracy—not oligarchy.(τὴν
δημοκρατίαν τὴν ἀριστοκρατίᾳ μεμιγμένην).The unfavourable meaning which is often attached to the word democracy,
when it does not arise from simple ignorance, probably arises from
the use of the word by Aristotle.7) three
lawful forms of government, _kingship_ (βασιλεία), _aristocracy_
(ἀριστοκρατία), and what he calls specially πολιτεία or _commonwealth_.Of these he makes three corruptions, _tyranny_, _oligarchy_, and
_democracy_ (τυραννίς, ὀλιγαρχία, δημοκρατία), defining _democracy_ to
be a government carried on for the special benefit of the poor (πρὸς τὸ
συμφέρον τὸ τῶν ἀπόρων).In this there is something of a philosopher’s
contempt for all popular government, and it is certain that Aristotle’s
way of speaking is not that which is usual in the Greek historians.Polybios, like Herodotus and Thucydides, uses the word democracy in
the old honourable sense, and he takes (ii.38) as his special type of
democracy the constitution of the Achaian League, which certainly had
in it a strong element of practical aristocracy (see History of Federal
Government, cap.): ἰσηγορίας καὶ παρρησίας καὶ καθόλου δημοκρατίας
ἀληθινῆς σύστημα καὶ προαίρεσιν εἰλικρινεστέραν οὐκ ἂν εὕροι τις τῆς
παρὰ τοῖς Ἀχαιοῖς ὑπαρχούσης.In short, what Aristotle calls πολιτεία
Polybios calls δημοκρατία; what Aristotle calls δημοκρατία Polybios
calls ὀχλοκρατία.(14) It follows that, when the commonwealth of Florence disfranchised
the whole of the noble families, it lost its right to be called a
democracy.See the passing of the Ordinance of Justice in Sismondi,
Républiques Italiennes, iv.65; Chroniche di Giovanni Villani, viii.(15) On Slavery in England, see Norman Conquest, i.81, 333, 368,
432, iv.For fuller accounts, see Kemble’s Saxons in England,
i.185; Zöpfl, _Geschichte der deutschen Rechtsinstitute_, 62.The
three classes of nobles, common freemen, and slaves cannot be better
set forth than in the Life of Saint Lebuin (Pertz, ii.361): “Sunt
denique ibi, qui illorum lingua edlingi, sunt qui frilingi, sunt qui
lassi dicuntur, quod in Latina sonat lingua, nobiles, ingenuiles, atque
serviles.”

(16) On the _Wite-þeow_, the slave reduced to slavery for his crimes,
see Kemble, Saxons in England, i.He is mentioned several times in
the laws of Ine, 24, 48, 54, where, as usual in the West-Saxon laws, a
distinction is drawn between the English and the Welsh _wite-þeow_.The
second reference contains a provision for the case of a newly enslaved
_þeow_ who should be charged with a crime committed before he was
condemned to slavery.(17) I wish to leave the details of Eastern matters to Eastern
scholars.But there are several places in the Old Testament where
we see something very much like a general assembly, combined with
distinctions of rank among its members, and with the supremacy of a
single chief over all.Ζεὺς δὲ Θέμιστα κέλευσε θεοὺς ἀγορήνδε καλέσσαι
          Κρατὸς ἄπ' Οὐλύμποιο πολυπτύχου· ἡ δ’ ἄρα πάντη
          Φοιτήσασα κέλευσε Διὸς πρὸς δῶμα νέεσθαι.Οὔτε τις οὖν Ποταμῶν ἀπέην, νόσφ' Ὠκεανοῖο,
          Οὔτ' ἄρα Νυμφάων ταί τ' ἄλσεα καλὰ νέμονται,
          Καὶ πηγὰς ποταμῶν, καὶ πίσεα ποιήεντα.Besides the presence of the Nymphs in the divine _Mycel Gemót_,
something might also be said about the important position of Hêrê,
Athênê, and other female members of the inner council.We find the mortal Assembly described at length in the second book of
the Iliad, and indeed by implication at the very beginning of the first
book.(19) We hear the applause of the assembly in i.333, and in
the Trojan Assembly, xviii.(20) On the whole nature of the Homeric ἀγορή see Gladstone’s Homer and
the Homeric Age, iii.Gladstone has to my thinking understood
the spirit of the old Greek polity much better than Mr.(21) There is no need to go into any speculations as to the early
Roman Constitution, as to the origin of the distinction of _patres_
and _plebs_, or any of the other points about which controversies
have raged among scholars.The three elements stand out in every
version, legendary and historical.8, Romulus first holds
his general Assembly and then chooses his Senate.26 we get
the distinct appeal from the King, or rather from the magistrates
acting by his authority, to an Assembly which, whatever might be its
constitution, is more popular than the Senate.(22) It is hardly needful to show how the Roman Consuls simply stepped
into the place of the Kings.It is possible, as some have thought, that
the revolution threw more power into patrician hands than before, but
at all events the Senate and the Assembly go on just as before.(23) Tacitus, de Moribus Germaniæ, c.7-13:

“Reges ex nobilitate; Duces ex virtute sumunt.Nec Regibus infinita aut
libera potestas; et Duces exemplo potius quam imperio: si prompti, si
conspicui, si ante aciem agant, admiratione præsunt.... De minoribus
rebus Principes consultant; de majoribus omnes; ita tamen ut ea quoque
quorum penes plebem arbitrium est apud Principes pertractentur....
Ut turbæ placuit, considunt armati.Silentium per Sacerdotes, quibus
tum et coercendi jus est, imperatur.Mox Rex, vel Princeps, prout
ætas cuique, prout nobilitas, prout decus bellorum, prout facundia
est audiuntur, auctoritate suadendi magis quam jubendi potestate.Si displicuit sententia, fremitu adspernantur; sin placuit, frameas
concutiunt.Honoratissimum adsensûs genus est, armis laudare.Licet
apud concilium adcusare quoque et discrimen capitis intendere....
Eliguntur in iisdem conciliis et Principes, qui jura per pagos vicosque
reddant.Centeni singulis ex plebe comites, consilium simul et
auctoritas, adsunt.Nihil autem neque publicæ neque privatæ rei nisi
armati agunt.”

For a commentary, see Zöpfl, _Geschichte der deutschen
Rechtsinstitute_, p.See also Allen, Royal Prerogative, 12, 162.The primitive Constitution lasted
longest at the other end of the Empire, in Friesland.See Eichhorn,
_Deutsche Staats-und Rechtsgeschichte_, ii.Zöpfl,
_Geschichte der deutschen Rechtsquellen_, p.(25) Τὰ ἀρχαῖα ἤθη κρατείτω is an ecclesiastical maxim; rightly
understood, it is just as true in politics.(26) See my papers on “the Origin of the English Nation” and “the
Alleged Permanence of Roman Civilization in England” in Macmillan’s
Magazine, 1870.(27) See Schmid, _Gesetze der Angel-Sachsen_, on the words “_wealh_”
and “_wylne_.” Earle, Philology of the English Tongue, 318.On the fact
that the English settlers brought their women with them, see Historical
Essays, p.(28) On _Eorlas_ and _Ceorlas_ I have said something in the History
of the Norman Conquest, i.See the two words in Schmid, and the
references there given.(29) On the Barons of Attinghausen, see Blumer, _Staats- und
Rechtsgeschichte der schweizerischen Demokratien_, i.(30) I cannot at this moment lay my hand on my authority for this
curious, and probably mythical, custom, but it is equally good as an
illustration any way.(31) This custom is described by Diodôros, i.The priest first
recounted the good deeds of the King and attributed to him all possible
virtues; then he invoked a curse for whatever has been done wrongfully,
absolving the King from all blame and praying that the vengeance might
fall on his ministers who had suggested evil things (τὸ τελευταῖον
ὑπὲρ τῶν ἀγνοουμένων ἀρὰν ἐποιεῖτο, τὸν μὲν βασιλέα τῶν ἐγκλημάτων
ἐξαιρούμενος, εἰς δὲ τοὺς ὑπηρετοῦντας καὶ διδάξαντας τὰ φαῦλα καὶ τὴν
βλαβὴν καὶ τὴν τιμωρίαν ἀξιῶν ἀποσκῆψαι).He wound up with some moral
and religious advice.25) distinguishes “eæ gentes quæ regnantur” from
others.And in 43 he speaks of “erga Reges obsequium” as characteristic
of some particular tribes: see Norman Conquest, i.(33) On the use of the words _Ealdorman_ and _Heretoga_, see Norman
Conquest, i.583, and the passages in Kemble and Allen
there referred to.(35) See Kemble’s Saxons in England, i.152, and Massmann’s Ulfilas,
744.(36) See the words _driht_, _drihten_ in Bosworth’s Anglo-Saxon
Dictionary.(37) To say nothing of other objections to this derivation, its author
must have fancied that _ing_ and not _end_ was the ending of the
Old-English participle.The mistake is as old as Sir Thomas Smith.I am
afraid of meddling with Sanscrit, but it strikes me that the views
of Allen and Kemble are not inconsistent with a connexion with the
Sanscrit _Ganaka_.As one of the curiosities of etymology, it is worth
noticing that Mr.Wedgwood makes the word “probably identical with
Tartar _chan_.”

(39) We read in the Chronicles, 449, how, on the first Jutish landing
in Kent, “heora _heretogan_ wæron twegen gebroðra Hengest and Horsa.”
It is only in 455, on the death of Horsa, that “æfter Þam Hengest feng
to _rice_ and Æsc his sunu”; and in 488, seemingly on the death of
Hengest, “Æsc feng to _rice_ and was xxiiii wintra Cantwara _cyning_.”
So among the West-Saxons, in 495, “coman twegen _ealdormen_ on Brytene,
Cerdic and Cynric his sunu.” It is only in 519 that we read “her Cerdic
and Cynric West-Sexena _rice_ onfengun.”

(40) The distinction between Kings and Jarls comes out very strongly
in the account of the battle of Ashdown (Æscesdune) in the Chronicles
in 871.The Danes “wæron on twam gefylcum, on oþrum wæs Bagsecg and
Healfdene, þa hæðenan _cingas_ and on oðrum wæron þa _eorlas_.” It may
be marked that in the English army King Æthelred is set against the
Danish Kings, and his brother the Ætheling Ælfred against the Jarls.So
in the Song of Brunanburh we read of the five Kings and seven Jarls who
were slain.“Fife lagon          sweordum aswefede,
   on ðæm campstede    swilce seofone eac
   ciningas geonge,    eorlas Anlafes.”

We may mark that the Kings were young, as if they had been chosen
“ex nobilitate;” nothing is said of the age of the Jarls, who were
doubtless chosen “ex virtute.”

(41) I have quoted the passage from Bæda about the satraps in Norman
Conquest, i.The passage in the Life of Saint Lebuin, quoted in
note 15, also speaks of “principes” as presiding over the several
_pagi_ or _gauen_, but he speaks of no King or other common chief over
the whole country.And this is the more to be marked, as there was a
“generale concilium” of the whole Old-Saxon nation, formed, as we are
told, of twelve chosen men from each _gau_.This looks like an early
instance of representation, but it should be remembered that we are
here dealing with a constitution strictly Federal.In the like sort we find the rulers of the West-Goths at the time of
their crossing the Danube spoken of as _Judices_.See Ammianus, xxvii.5, and the notes of Lindenbrog and Valesius.So also Gibbon, c. xxv.So Jornandes(26) speaks of “primates eorum, et
duces, qui regum vice illis præerant.” Presently he calls Fredigern
“Gothorum regulus,” like the _subreguli_ or _under-cyningas_ of our own
History.28 Athanaric, the successor of Fredigern, is
pointedly called _Rex_.On all this, see Allen, Royal Prerogative, 163.(43) The best instance in English History of the process by which a
kingdom changed into a province, by going through the intermediate
stage of a half-independent Ealdormanship, is to be found in the
history of South-Western Mercia under its Ealdorman Æthelred and the
Lady Æthelflæd, in the reigns of Ælfred and Eadward the Elder.(45) Iliad, ix.160:—

       καὶ μοὶ ὑποστήτω, ὅσσον β α σ ι λ ε ύ τ ε ρ ό ς ἐιμι.(46) The instances in which a great kingdom has been broken up into a
number of small states practically independent, but owning a nominal
superiority in the successor of the original Sovereign, are not few.In the case of the Empire I have found something to say about it in my
Historical Essays, 151, and in the case of the Caliphate in my History
and Conquest of the Saracens, 137.How the same process took place with
the Mogul Empire in India is set forth by Lord Macaulay in his Essays
on Lord Clive and Warren Hastings.But he should not have compared
the great Mogul, with his nominal sovereignty, to “the most helpless
driveller among the later Carlovingians,” a class whom Sir Francis
Palgrave has rescued from undeserved contempt.But the breaking up of
the Western Kingdom is none the less an example of the same law.The
most remarkable thing is the way, or rather the three different ways,
in which the scattered members have been brought together again in
Germany, Italy, and France.This process of dismemberment, where a nominal supremacy is still kept
by the original Sovereign, must be distinguished from that of falling
back upon Dukes or Ealdormen after a period of kingly rule.In this
latter case it would seem that no central sovereignty went on.(47) At this time of day I suppose it is hardly necessary to prove the
elective character of Old-English kingship.I have said what I have
to say about it in Norman Conquest, i.But I may quote one
most remarkable passage from the report made in 787 to Pope Hadrian the
First by George and Theophylact, his Legates in England (Haddan and
Stubbs, Councils and Ecclesiastical Documents, iii.“Sanximus
ut in ordinatione Regum nullus permittat pravorum prævalere assensum:
sed legitime Reges a sacerdotibus et senioribus populi eligantur.”
One would like to know who the “pravi” here denounced were.The
passage sounds very like a narrowing of the franchise or some other
interference with freedom of election, but in any case it bears witness
to the elective character of our ancient kingship, and to the general
popular character of the constitution.(48) I have described the powers of the Witan, as I understand them
and as they were understood by Mr.108 of the
History of the Norman Conquest and in some of the Appendices to that
volume.With regard to the powers of the Witan, I find no difference
between my own views and those of Professor Stubbs in the Introductory
Sketch to his Select Charters (p.11), where the relations between
the King and the Witan, and the general character of our ancient
constitution, are set forth with wonderful power and clearness.Stubbs and myself differing altogether as to the constitution
of the Witenagemót.I look upon it as an Assembly of the whole kingdom,
after the type of the smaller assemblies of the shire and other lesser
divisions.Stubbs fully admits the popular character of the smaller
assemblies, but denies any such character to the national gathering.It
is dangerous to set oneself up against the greatest master of English
constitutional history, but I must ask the reader to weigh what I say
in note Q in the Appendix to my first volume.(49) I have collected some of the instances of deposition in
Northumberland in the note following that on the constitution of the
Witenagemót.It is not at all unlikely that
the report of George and Theophylact quoted above may have a special
reference to the frequent changes among the Northumbrian Kings.(50) I have mentioned all the instances at vol.105 of the Norman
Conquest: Sigeberht, Æthelred, Harthacnut, Edward the Second, Richard
the Second, James the Second.It is remarkable that nearly all are
the second of their respective names; for, besides Æthelred, Edward,
Richard, and James, Harthacnut might fairly be called Cnut the Second.(51) Tacitus, De Moribus Germaniæ, 13, 14:—“Nec rubor inter comites
adspici.Gradus quinetiam et ipse comitatus habet, judicio ejus quem
sectantur; magnaque et comitum æmulatio quibus primus apud Principem
suum locus; et Principum cui plurimi et acerrimi comites.... Quum
ventum in aciem, turpe Principi virtute vinci, turpe comitatui virtutem
Principis non adæquare.Jam vero infame in omnem vitam ac probrosum,
superstitem Principi suo ex acie recessisse.Illum defendere, tueri,
sua quoque fortia facta gloriæ ejus adsignare, præcipuum sacramentum
est.Principes pro victoria pugnant; comites pro Principe.” See Allen,
Royal Prerogative, 142.(52) The original text of the Song of Maldon will be found in Thorpe’s
Analecta Anglo-Saxonica.My extracts are made from the modern English
version which I attempted in my Old-English History, p.I went
on the principle of altering the Old-English text no more than was
actually necessary to make it intelligible.When a word has altogether
dropped out of our modern language, I have of course changed it; when
a word is still in use, in however different a sense, I have kept it.Many words which were anciently used in a physical sense are now used
only metaphorically; thus “cringe” is used in one of the extracts in
its primary meaning of bowing or falling down, and therefore of dying.(53) The history of the Roman clientship is another of those points on
which legend and history and ingenious modern speculation all come to
much the same, as far as our present purpose is concerned.Whether the
clients were the same as the _plebs_ or not, at any rate no patricians
entered into the client relation, and this at once supplies the
contrast with Teutonic institutions.(54) The title of _dominus_, implying a master of slaves, was always
refused by the early Emperors.This is recorded of Augustus by
Suetonius (Aug.12), and still more distinctly of
Tiberius (Suetonius, Tib.Tiberius also refused
the title of _Imperator_, except in its strictly military sense:
οὔτε γὰρ δεσπότην ἑαυτὸν τοῖς ἐλευθέροις οὔτε αὐτοκράτορα πλὴν τοῖς
στρατιώταις καλεῖν ἐφίει.Caius is said (Aurelius Victor, Cæs.4) to have been called _dominus_, and there is no doubt about Domitian
(Suetonius, Dom.13, where see Reimar’s Note).Pliny
in his letters constantly addresses Trajan as _dominus_; yet in his
Panegyric(45) he draws the marked distinction: “Scis, ut sunt diversa
natura dominatio et principatus, ita non aliis esse principem gratiorem
quam qui maxime dominum graventur.” This marks the return to older
feelings and customs under Trajan.The final and formal establishment
of the title seems to have come in with the introduction of Eastern
ceremonies under Diocletian (see the passage already referred to in
Aurelius Victor).It is freely used by the later Panegyrists, as
for instance Eumenius, iv.13: “Domine Constanti,” “Domine
Maximiane, Imperator æterne,” and so forth.(55) Vitellius (Tac.58) was the first to employ Roman knights
in offices hitherto always filled by freedmen; but the system was not
fully established till the time of Hadrian (Spartianus, Hadrian, 22).89, 587, and the passages here quoted.(57) Both _hlàford_ and _hlæfdige_ (_Lord_ and _Lady_) are very
puzzling words as to the origin of their later syllables.It is enough
for my purpose if the connexion of the first syllable with _hlàf_ be
allowed.Different as is the origin of the two words, _hlàford_ always
translates _dominus_.The French _seigneur_, and the corresponding
forms in Italian and Spanish, come from the Latin _senior_, used as
equivalent to _dominus_.This is one of the large class of words which
are analogous to our _Ealdorman_.(58) This is fully treated by Palgrave, English Commonwealth, i.(59) On the change from the _alod_, _odal_, or _eðel_, a man’s very own
property, to the land held of a lord, see Hallam, Middle Ages, i.Kemble in his chapter on the Noble by Service, Saxons in England, i.(61) See the whole history and meaning of the word in the article
_þegen_ in Schmid’s Glossary.(63) Barbour, Bruce, i.fredome is A noble thing.”

So said Herodotus (v.78) long before:

   ἡ ἰσηγορίη ὡς ἔστι χρῆμα σπουδαῖον.(1) In the great poetical manifesto of the patriotic party in Henry the
Third’s reign, printed in Wright’s Political Songs of England (Camden
Society, 1839), there seems to be no demand whatever for new laws, but
only for the declaration and observance of the old.Thus, the passage
which I have chosen for one of my mottoes runs on thus:—

  “Igitur communitas regni consulatur;
   Et quid universitas sentiat sciatur,
   Cui leges propriæ maxime sunt notæ.Nec cuncti provinciæ sic sunt idiotæ,
   Quin sciant plus cæteris regni sui mores,
   Quos relinquant posteris hii qui sunt priores.Qui reguntur legibus magis ipsas sciunt;
   Quorum sunt in usibus plus periti fiunt;
   Et quia res agitur sua, plus curabunt,
   Et quo pax adquiritur sibi procurabunt.”

(2) On the renewal of the Laws of Eadward by William, see Norman
Conquest, iv.It should be marked that the
Laws of Eadward were again confirmed by Henry the First (see Stubbs,
90-99), and, as the Great Charter grew out of the Charter of Henry
the First produced by Archbishop Stephen Langton in 1213, the descent
of the Charter from the Laws of Eadward is very simple.See Roger of
Wendover, iii.The Primate there distinctly says that
he had made John swear to renew the Laws of Eadward.“Audistis quomodo,
tempore quo apud Wintoniam Regem absolvi, ipsum jurare compulerim, quod
leges iniquas destrueret et leges bonas, videlicet leges Eadwardi,
revocaret et in regno faceret ab omnibus observari.” It must be
remembered that the phrase of the Laws of Eadward or of any other King
does not really mean a code of laws of that King’s drawing up, but
simply the way of administering the Law, and the general political
condition, which existed in that King’s reign.This is all that would
be meant by the renewal of the Laws of Eadward in William’s time.It
simply meant that William was to rule as his English predecessors had
ruled before him.But, by the time of John, men had no doubt begun to
look on the now canonized Eadward as a lawgiver, and to fancy that
there was an actual code of laws of his to be put in force.On the various confirmations of the Great Charter, see Hallam, Middle
Ages, ii.“When they were told that there was no precedent
for declaring the throne vacant, they produced from among the records
of the Tower a roll of parchment, near three hundred years old, on
which, in quaint characters and barbarous Latin, it was recorded that
the Estates of the Realm had declared vacant the throne of a perfidious
and tyrannical Plantagenet.” See more at large in the debate of the
Conference between the Houses, ii.(4) See Kemble, Saxons in England, ii.This, it will be
remembered, is admitted by Professor Stubbs.See above, note 48 to
Chapter I.(6) I have collected these passages in my History of the Norman
Conquest, i.(7) On the acclamations of the Assembly, see note 19 to Chapter I. I
suspect that in all early assemblies, and not in that of Sparta only,
κρίνουσι βοῇ καὶ οὐ ψήφῳ (Thuc.We still retain the custom in
the cry of “Aye” and “No,” from which the actual vote is a mere appeal,
just like the division ordered by Sthenelaïdas when he professed not to
know on which side the shout was.100, and History of Federal Government, i.In this case the Chronicler, under
the year 1086, distinguishes two classes in the Assembly, “his witan
and ealle Þa landsittende men Þe ahtes wæron ofer eall Engleland.”
These “landsittende men” were evidently the forerunners of the “libere
tenentes,” who, whether their holdings were great or small, kept their
place in the early Parliaments.140-146, where will be
found many passages showing the still abiding traces of the popular
constitution of the Assembly.(10) The practice of summoning particular persons can be traced up to
very early times.202, for instances in the reign of
Æthelstan.On its use in later times, see Hallam, ii.254-260; and on
the irregularity in the way of summoning the spiritual peers, ii.The bearing of these precedents on the question of life peerages
will be seen by any one who goes through Sir T. E. May’s summary,
Constitutional History, i.(11) Sismondi, Histoire des Français, v.289: “Ce roi, le plus absolu
entre ceux qui ont porté la couronne de France, le moins occupé du
bien de ses peuples, le moins consciencieux dans son observation des
droits établis avant lui, est cependant le restaurateur des assemblées
populaires de la France, et l’auteur de la représentation des communes
dans les états généraux.” See Historical Essays, 45.(12) See the history of Stephen Martel in Sismondi, Histoire des
Français, vol.ix., and the account of the dominion of
the Butchers, vii.259, and more at large in Thierry’s History of the
Tiers-État, capp.(13) The Parliament of Paris, though it had its use as some small check
on the mere despotism of the Crown, can hardly come under the head of
free institutions.France, as France, under the old state of things,
cannot be said to have kept any free institutions at all; the only
traces of freedom were to be found in the local Estates which still met
in several of the provinces.See De Tocqueville, Ancien Régime, 347.(14) The thirteenth century was the time when most of the existing
states and nations of Europe took something like their present form and
constitution.The great powers which had hitherto, in name at least,
divided the Christian and Mahometan world, the Eastern and Western
Empires and the Eastern and Western Caliphates, may now be looked on
as practically coming to an end.England, France, and Spain began to
take something like their present shape, and to show the beginnings of
the characteristic position and policy of each.The chief languages of
Western Europe grew into something like their modern form.In short,
the character of this age as a time of beginnings and endings might be
traced out in detail through the most part of Europe and Asia.Pauli does not scruple to give him this title in his admirable
monograph, “_Simon von Montfort Graf von Leicester, der Schöpfer des
Hauses der Gemeinen_.” The career of the Earl should be studied in this
work, and in Mr.Blaauw’s “Barons’ War.”

(16)                “Numquam libertas gratior exstat
      Quam sub rege pio.”—Claudian, ii.“England owes her escape from such calamities
to an event which her historians have generally represented as
disastrous.Her interest was so directly opposed to the interest of her
rulers that she had no hope but in their errors and misfortunes.The
talents and even the virtues of her six first French Kings were a curse
to her.The follies and vices of the seventh were her salvation....
England, which, since the battle of Hastings, had been ruled generally
by wise statesmen, always by brave soldiers, fell under the dominion
of a trifler and a coward.The Norman nobles were compelled to make
their election between the island and the continent.Shut up by the sea
with the people whom they had hitherto oppressed and despised, they
gradually came to regard England as their country, and the English as
their countrymen.The two races so long hostile, soon found that they
had common interests and common enemies.Both were alike aggrieved by
the tyranny of a bad King.Both were alike indignant at the favour
shown by the court to the natives of Poitou and Aquitaine.The great
grandsons of those who had fought under William and the great grandsons
of those who had fought under Harold began to draw near to each other
in friendship; and the first pledge of their reconciliation was the
Great Charter, won by their united exertions, and framed for their
common benefit.”

(18) I have tried to work out the gradual character of the transfer of
lands and offices under William in various parts of the fourth volume
of my History of the Norman Conquest; see especially p.The popular notion of a general scramble for everything gives a most
false view of William’s whole character and position.(20) This is distinctly asserted in the Dialogus de Scaccario (i.10),
under Henry the Second: “Jam cohabitantibus Anglicis et Normannis,
et alterutrum uxores ducentibus vel nubentibus, sic permixtæ sunt
nationes, ut vix discerni possit hodie, de liberis loquor, quis
Anglicus quis Normannus sit genere; exceptis duntaxat ascriptitiis qui
villani dicuntur, quibus non est liberum obstantibus dominis suis a sui
statûs conditione discedere.”

(21) The Angevin family are commonly known as the Plantagenets; but
that name was never used as a surname till the fifteenth century.The name is sometimes convenient, but it is not a really correct
description, like Tudor and Stewart, both of which were real surnames,
borne by the two families before they came to the Crown.In the
almanacks the Angevins are called “The Saxon line restored,” a name
which gives a false idea, though there can be no doubt that Henry the
Second was fully aware of the advantages to be drawn from his remote
female descent from the Old-English Kings.The point to be borne in
mind is that the accession of Henry is the beginning of a distinct
dynasty which could not be called either Norman or English in any but
the most indirect way.(22) I do not remember anything in any of the writers of Henry the
Second’s time to justify the popular notions about “Normans and
Saxons” as two distinct and hostile bodies.Nor do we as yet hear many
complaints of favour being shown to absolute foreigners in preference
to either, though it is certain that many high preferments, especially
in the Church, were held by men who were not English in either sense.The peculiar position of Henry the Second was something like that of
the Emperor Charles the Fifth, that of a prince ruling over a great
number of distinct states without being nationally identified with any
of them.Henry ruled over England, Normandy, and Aquitaine, but he was
neither English, Norman, nor Gascon.(23) That is the greater, the continental, part of the Duchy.The
insular part of Normandy, the Channel Islands, was not lost, and it
still remains attached to the English Crown, not as part of the United
Kingdom, but as a separate dependency.310, 367; and on the appointment of
Bishops and Abbots, i.(25) See the Ordinance in Norman Conquest, iv.Stubbs, Select
Charters, 81.(27) It should be remembered that the clerical immunities which were
claimed in this age were by no means confined to those whom we should
now call clergymen, but that they also took in that large class of
persons who held smaller ecclesiastical offices without being what we
should call in holy orders.The Church also claimed jurisdiction in
the causes of widows and orphans, and in various cases where questions
of perjury, breach of faith, and the like were concerned.Thus John
Bishop of Poitiers writes to Archbishop Thomas (Giles, Sanctus Thomas,
vi.238) complaining that the King’s officers had forbidden him to hear
the causes of widows and orphans, and also to hear causes in matters
of usury: “prohibentes ne ad querelas viduarum vel orphanorum vel
clericorum aliquem parochianorum meorum in causam trahere præsumerem
super quacumque possessione immobili, donec ministeriales regis, vel
dominorum ad quorum feudum res controversiæ pertineret, in facienda
justitia eis defecissent.Deinde ne super accusatione fœnoris
quemquam audirem.” This gives a special force to the acclamations
with which Thomas was greeted on his return as “the father of the
orphans and the judge of the widows:” “Videres mox pauperum turbam
quæ convenerat in occursum, hos succinctos ut prævenirent et patrem
suum applicantem exciperent, et benedictionem præriperent, alios vero
humi se humiliter prosternentes, ejulantes hos, plorantes illos præ
gaudio, et omnes conclamantes, Benedictus qui venit in nomine Domini,
pater orphanorum et judex viduarum!et pauperes quidem sic.” Herbert
of Bosham, Giles, Sanctus Thomas, vii.See more in
Historical Essays, 99.(28) On the cruel punishments inflicted in the King’s courts Herbert
of Bosham is very emphatic in more than one passage.101) as a merit of the Bishops’ courts that in them no mutilations
were inflicted.Men were punished there “absque omni mutilatione
vel deformatione membrorum.” But he by no means claims freedom from
mutilation as a mere clerical privilege; he distinctly condemns it in
any case.“Adeo etiam quod ordinis privilegium excludat cauterium: quam
tamen pœnam communiter inter homines etiam jus forense damnat: ne
videlicet in homine Dei imago deformetur.” (vii.A most curious
story illustrative of the barbarous jurisprudence of the time will be
found in Benedict’s Miracula Sancti Thomæ, 184.(29) One of the Constitutions of Clarendon forbade villains to be
ordained without the consent of their lords.“Filii rusticorum non
debent ordinari absque assensu domini de cujus terra nati dignoscuntur”
(Stubbs, Select Charters, 134).On the principles of feudal law nothing
can be said against this, as the lord had a property in his villain
which he would lose by the villain’s ordination.The prohibition
is noticed in some remarkable lines of the earliest biographer of
Thomas, Garnier of Pont-Sainte-Maxence (La Vie de Saint Thomas le
Martyr, Paris, 1859, p.89), where he strongly asserts the equality of
gentleman and villain before God:—

  “Fils à vilains ne fust en nul liu ordenez
   Sanz l’otrei sun seigneur de cui terre il fu nez.Et deus à sun servise nus a tuz apelez!Mielz valt filz à vilain qui est preux e senez,
   Que ne feit gentilz hum failliz et debutez.”

Thomas himself was not the son of a villain, but his birth was such
that the King could sneer at him as “plebeius quidam clericus.”

(30) We are not inclined to find fault with such an appointment as
that of Stephen Langton; still his forced election at the bidding
of Innocent was a distinct breach of the rights of the King, of the
Convent of Christ Church, and of the English nation generally.See the
account of his election in Roger of Wendover, iii.314; Hook’s Archbishops, ii.(31) See the Bulls and Letters by which Innocent professed to annul the
Great Charter in Roger of Wendover, iii.323, 327; the excommunication
of the Barons in iii.336; and the suspension of the Archbishop in iii.(32) There is a separate treatise on the Miracles of Simon of Montfort,
printed along with Rishanger’s Chronicle by the Camden Society, 1840.(33) I think I may safely say that the only royalist chronicler of the
reign of Henry the Third is Thomas Wykes, the Austin Canon of Osney.There is also one poem on the royalist side, to balance many on the
side of the Barons, among the Political Songs published by the Camden
Society, 1839, page 128.Letters to Earl Simon and his Countess Eleanor form a considerable part
of the letters of Robert Grosseteste, published by Mr.Luard for the
Master of the Rolls.Matthew Paris also (879, Wats) speaks of him as
“episcopus Lincolniensis Robertus, cui comes tamquam patri confessori
exstitit familiarissimus.” This however was in the earlier part of
Simon’s career, before the war had broken out.The share of Bishop
Walter of Cantilupe, who was present at Evesham and absolved the Earl
and his followers, will be found in most of the Chronicles of the time.It comes out well in the riming Chronicle of Robert of Gloucester (ii.558):—

  “Þe bissop Water of Wurcetre asoiled hom alle pere
   And prechede hom, þat hii adde of deþ þe lasse fere.”

This writer says of the battle of Evesham:—

  “Suich was þe morþre of Eivesham (vor bataile non it was).”

(34) This letter, addressed in 1247 to Pope Innocent the Fourth, will
be found in Matthew Paris (721, Wats).It is written in the name of
“universitas cleri et populi per provinciam Cantuariensem constituti,”
and it ends, “quia communitas nostra sigillum non habet, præsentes
literas signo communitatis civitatis Londinensis vestræ sanctitati
mittimus consignatas.” Another letter in the same form follows to the
Cardinals.There are two earlier letters in 1245 and 1246 (Matthew
Paris, 666, 700), the former from the “magnates et universitas regni
Angliæ,” the other in the name of Richard Earl of Cornwall (afterwards
King of the Romans), Simon Earl of Leicester, and other Earls, “et alii
totius regni Angliæ Barones, proceres, et magnates, et nobiles portuum
maris habitatores, necnon et clerus et populus universus.” The distinct
mention of the Cinque Ports, whose representatives in Parliament are
still called Barons—the “nobiles” of the letter—should be noticed.(35) The writer of the Gesta Stephani(3) distinctly attributes the
election of Stephen to the citizens of London: “Majores igitur natu,
consultuque quique provectiores, concilium coegere, deque regni
statu, pro arbitrio suo, utilia in commune providentes, ad regem
eligendum unanimiter conspiravere.” He then goes on with the details
of the election.He is borne out by the Chronicle 1135: “Stephne de
Blais com to Lundene and te Lundenisce folc him underfeng;” and by
William of Malmesbury, Historia Novella, i.11: “A Londoniensibus et
Wintoniensibus in Regem exceptus est.” So again when the Legate, Henry
Bishop of Winchester, holds a council for the election of the Empress
Matilda, the citizens of London were summoned, and it is distinctly
said that they held the rank of nobles or barons: “Londonienses
(qui sunt quasi optimates, pro magnitudine civitatis, in Anglia).”
“Londonienses, qui præcipui habebantur in Anglia, sicut proceres”
(Historia Novella, iii.All this is exactly like the earlier
elections of Kings before the Conquest.(36) The words of the Charter 12-14 (Stubbs, 290) are: “Nullum
scutagium vel auxilium ponatur in regno nostro, nisi per commune
consilium regni nostri, nisi ad corpus nostrum redimendum, etc.....
Et ad habendum commune consilium regni, de auxilio assidendo aliter
quam in tribus casibus prædictis, vel de scutagio assidendo, summoneri
faciemus archiepiscopos, episcopos, abbates, comites, et majores
barones, sigillatim per litteras nostras; et præterea faciemus
summoneri in generali, per vicecomites et ballivos nostros, omnes
illos qui de nobis tenent in capite.” This is exactly like the entry
in the Chronicle (1123), describing the summoning of a Witenagemót by
Henry the First: “Da sone Þæræfter sende se kyng hise write ofer eal
Englalande, and bed hise biscopes and hise abbates and hise Þeignes
ealle Þet hi scolden cumen to his gewitenemot on Candelmesse deig to
Gleawceastre him togeanes; and hi swa diden.”

(37) These first glimmerings of parliamentary representation were
carefully traced out by Hallam (Middle Ages, ii.They can
now be more fully studied in the work of Professor Stubbs.On the
summons in 1213 of four men for each shire besides “milites et barones”
(“quatuor discretos homines de comitatu tuo illuc venire facias”),
the Professor remarks (278): “It is the first writ in which the ‘four
discreet men’ of the county appear as representatives; the first
instance of the summoning of the folkmoot to a general assembly by the
machinery already used for judicial purposes.”

(38) On this subject the eighth chapter of Sir Francis Palgrave’s
English Commonwealth should be studied.(39) For the whole career of Simon I must again refer generally to
Pauli and Blaauw.The great writ itself, dated at Worcester, December
14th, 1264, will be found in Rymer’s Fœdera, i.It has often
been noticed how small is the number of Earls and other lay Barons, and
how unusually large the number of churchmen, who are summoned to this
Parliament.The whole list will be found in Rymer.The parts of the
writ which concern us stand thus:

“Item mandatum est singulis vicecomitibus per Angliam; quod venire
faciant duos milites de legalioribus, probioribus et discretioribus
militibus singulorum comitatuum, ad Regem London’ in octab’ prædictis,
in formâ supradictâ.“Item in formâ prædictâ scribitur civibus Ebor’, civibus Lincoln’,
et cæteris burgis Angliæ; quod mittant in formâ prædictâ duos de
discretioribus, legalioribus, et probioribus, tam civibus, quam
burgensibus suis.“Item in formâ prædictâ mandatum est baronibus, et probis hominibus
Quinque Portuum.”

“This is often regarded as the origin of popular representation; but it
is not in any sense entitled to that praise.The novelty was simply the
assembling the representatives of the towns in conjunction with those
of the counties; this was now done for the first time for the purpose
of the national council.” Stubbs, 401.(40) The account of this most remarkable trial, held on June 11th,
1252, is given in a letter from Simon’s intimate friend the famous
Franciscan Adam Marsh (de Marisco) to Bishop Robert Grosseteste.Brewer’s Monumenta Franciscana, p.122,
and there is an English translation in the Appendix to Mrs.Green’s
Life of Countess Eleanor, English Princesses, ii.Simon’s
witnesses, knights and citizens, come “muniti litteris patentibus
communitatis Burdegalensis, in quâ quasi totum robur Vasconiæ ad
distringendum hostiles et fideles protegendum consistere dignoscitur,”
setting forth how good Simon’s government was in every way, and how
those who brought charges against him did it only because his strict
justice had put a check on their misdoings.We may compare the words of
the great poetical manifesto (Political Songs, 76).“Seductorem nominant S. atque fallacem,
   Facta sed examinant probantque veracem.”

(41) For the Londoners at Lewes let us take the account of an enemy.Thomas Wykes (148) tells us how the Earl set out, “glorians in virtute
sua congregata baronum multitudine copiosa, Londoniensium innumerabili
agmine circumcinctus, quia legitur stultorum infinitus est numerus.”
Presently we read how the “Londoniensium innumera multitudo, bellorum
ignara,” were put to flight by the Lord Edward very much after the
manner of Prince Rupert.(42) On the religious reverence paid to Earl Waltheof, see Norman
Conquest, ii.I have there referred to the office of Thomas of
Lancaster, which will be found in Political Songs, 268.Some of the
pieces are what we should think most daring parodies of parts of the
Church Service, but we may be sure that what was intended was reverence
and not irreverence.There is another parody of the same kind in honour
of Earl Thomas, a little earlier back in the volume, p.It was a
matter of course that Thomas of Lancaster should be likened to Thomas
of Canterbury.“Gaude, Thoma, ducum decus, lucerna Lancastriæ,
   Qui per necem imitaris Thomam Cantuariæ;
   Cujus caput conculcatur pacem ob ecclesiæ,
   Atque tuum detruncatur causa pacis Angliæ.(43) Let us take a Latin, a French, and an English specimen of the
poems in which Simon’s death was lamented and his intercession implored.“Salve, Symon Montis Fortis,
     Totius flos militiæ,
   Durus pœnas passus mortis,
     Protector gentis Angliæ.Sunt de sanctis inaudita
   Cunctis passis in hac vita,
     Quemquam passum talia;
   Manus, pedes, amputari,
   Caput, corpus, vulnerari,
     Abscidi virilia.Sis pro nobis intercessor
   Apud Deum, qui defensor
     In terris exstiteras.”—(Political Songs, 124.)The French poem which follows directly in the collection is too long to
copy in full.This is perhaps the most remarkable stanza, in which we
again find the comparison with Thomas of Canterbury:—

  “Mès par sa mort, le cuens Mountfort conquist la victorie,
   Come ly martyr de Caunterbyr, finist sa vie;
   Ne voleit pas li bon Thomas qe perist seinte Eglise,
   Le cuens auxi se combati, e morust sauntz feyntise.Ore est ocys la flur de pris, qe taunt savoit de guerre,
   Ly quens Montfort, sa dure mort molt emplorra la terre.”

In this poem there is not, as in the Latin one, any direct prayer to
the martyred Earl, but in the last stanza we read:—

  “Sire Simoun ly prodhom, e sa compagnie,
   En joie vont en ciel amount, en pardurable vie.”

The only English piece on these wars belongs to an earlier date,
namely, the satirical poem against King Richard, how the one English
Augustus

  “Makede him a castel of a mulne post;”

but we get verses on Simon’s death in the Chronicle of Robert of
Gloucester (ii.559):—

  “& sir Simond was aslawe, & is folk al to grounde,
   More murÞre are nas in so lute stounde.Vor Þere was werst Simond de Mountfort aslawe, alas!& sir Henri is sone, Þat so gentil knizt was.*       *       *       *       *

   & among alle oÞere mest reuÞe it was ido,
   Þat sir Simon Þe olde man demembred was so.”

He then goes on with the details of the dismemberment, of which a
picture may be seen opposite p.Blaauw’s book, and then goes
on with the lines which I have before quoted:—

  “Suich was Þe morÞre of Eivesham (vor bataile non it was),
   And Þer wiÞ Jesu Crist wel vuele ipaied was,
   As he ssewede bitokninge grisliche and gode,
   As it vel of him sulue, Þo he deide on Þe rode,
   Þat Þoru al Þe middelerd derk hede Þer was inou.”

(44) On the occasional and irregular summoning of the borough members
between 1265 and 1295 see Hallam, Middle Ages, ii.160, 165, and
more fully in Stubbs, Select Charters, 420, 427, where the gradual
developement of parliamentary representation is treated as it has
never been treated before, with a full citation of the authorities.The language in which the chroniclers speak of the constitution of the
early Parliaments of Edward is as vague as that in which our ancient
Gemóts are described.Sometimes they speak only of “proceres” and the
like; sometimes they distinctly mention the popular element.Curiously
enough, the official language is sometimes more popular than that of
the annalists.Thus the Winchester Annals, recording the Statute of
Westminster in 1273, call the Assembly which passed it a “communis
convocatio omnium magnatum regni,” though it incidentally implies the
presence of other persons, “quamplures de regno qui aliqua feoda de
corona regia tenuerunt.” But the preamble of the Statute itself records
the “assentement des erceveskes, eveskes, abbes, priurs, contes,
barons, et _la communaute de la tere_ ileokes somons.” So in the later
Parliament of the same year the Annals speak only of the “communis
consensus archiepiscoporum, comitum, et baronum,” while the official
description is “prælati, comites, barones, et alii de regno nostro.”
But in an earlier Assembly, that held in 1273, before Edward had come
back to England, the same Winchester Annals tell us how “convenerunt
archiepiscopi et episcopi, comites et barones, et _de quolibet comitatu
quatuor milites et de qualibet civitate quatuor_.” This and the
summons to the Parliament of 1285, which sat in judgement on David
of Wales (Stubbs, 453, 457), seem the most distinct cases of borough
representation earlier than 1295, since which time the summoning of the
borough members has gone on regularly.Stubbs’
remarks on the Assemblies of “the transitionary period” in pp.465, 469
should be specially studied.(45) The history of the resistance of these two Earls to King Edward,
which led to the great Confirmation of the Charters in 1297, will be
found in all the histories of the time, old and new.See also Stubbs,
431, 479.I feel no difficulty in reconciling respect for Edward with
respect for the men who withstood him.The case is well put by Stubbs,
34, 35.(46) The exact value of the document commonly known as the statute “De
Tallagio non concedendo” is discussed by Professor Stubbs, p.It
is perhaps safest to look on it, like many of the earlier collections
of laws, not indeed as an actual statute, but as good evidence of a
principle which, from the time of the Confirmation of the Charters, has
been universally received.The words are—

“Nullum tallagium vel auxilium per nos vel hæredes nostros de cetero in
regno nostro imponatur seu levetur, sine voluntate et assensu communi
archiepiscoporum, episcoporum et aliorum prælatorum, comitum, baronum,
militum, burgensium, et aliorum liberorum hominum in regno nostro.”
This, it will be seen, is the same provision which I have already
quoted (see above, Note 36) from the Great Charter of John, but which
was left out in the Charter in the form in which it was confirmed by
Henry the Third.See Stubbs, 330, 332, 336.(47) I have said this before in Historical Essays, p.On the
strongly marked legal character of Edward’s age, and especially of
Edward’s own mind, see Stubbs, 417.(48) The great statute of treason of 25 Edward the Third (see the
Revised Edition of the Statutes, i.185) secures the life of the King,
his wife, and his eldest son, and the chastity of his wife, his eldest
daughter, and his eldest son’s wife.But the personal privilege goes no
further.As the Law of England knows no classes of men except peers and
commoners, it follows that the younger children of the King—the eldest
is born Duke of Cornwall—are, in strictness of speech, commoners,
unless they are personally raised to the peerage.I am not aware that
either case has ever arisen, but I conceive that there is nothing to
hinder a King’s son, not being a peer, from voting at an election, or
from being chosen to the House of Commons, and I conceive that, if
he committed a crime, he would be tried by a jury.Mere precedence
and titles have nothing to do with the matter, though probably a good
deal of confusion arises from the very modern fashion—one might almost
say the modern vulgarism—of calling all the children of the King or
Queen “Princes” and “Princesses.” As late as the time of George the
Second uncourtly Englishmen were still found who eschewed the foreign
innovation, and who spoke of the Lady Caroline and the Lady Emily, as
their fathers had done before them.Another modern vulgarism is that of using the word “royal”—“royal
visit,” “royal marriage,” and so forth—when there is no royalty in the
case, the person spoken of being a subject, perhaps a commoner.(49) On the parliamentary position of the clergy see Hallam, Middle
Ages, ii.And as far as the reign of Edward the First is
concerned, see the series of summonses in Stubbs, 442.(50) On this important constitutional change, which was made in
1664, without any Act of Parliament, but by a mere verbal agreement
between Archbishop Sheldon and Lord Chancellor Clarendon, see Hallam,
Constitutional History, ii.(51) This is true on the whole, especially at the beginning of the
institution of the States General, though there were also _roturiers_
who were the immediate burgesses of the King.See Thierry, History
of the Tiers Etat, i.It is in that work that the
history of that branch of the States General should be studied.(52) The question of one or two Chambers in an ordinary monarchy or
commonwealth is altogether different from the same question under a
Federal system.In England or France the question between one or two
Chambers in the Legislature is simply a question in which of the two
ways the Legislature is likely to do its work best.But in a Federal
constitution, like that of Switzerland or the United States, the two
Chambers are absolutely necessary.The double sovereignty, that of
the whole nation and that of the independent and equal States which
have joined together to form it, can be rightly represented only
by having two Chambers, one of them, the _Nationalrath_ or House
of Representatives, directly representing the nation as such, and
the other, the _Ständerath_ or Senate, representing the separate
sovereignty of the Cantons.In the debates early in 1872 as to the
revision of the Swiss Federal Constitution, a proposal made in the
_Nationalrath_ for the abolition of the _Ständerath_ was thrown out by
a large majority.(53) On the old Constitution of Sweden, see Laing’s Tour in Sweden.(54) This common mistake and its cause are fully explained by Hallam,
Middle Ages, ii.(55) “The two Houses had contended violently in 1675, concerning the
appellate jurisdiction of the Lords; they had contended, with not less
violence, in 1704, upon the jurisdiction of the Commons in matters of
election; they had quarrelled rudely, in 1770, while insisting upon
the exclusion of strangers.But upon general measures of public policy
their differences had been rare and unimportant.” May’s Constitutional
History, i.The writer goes on to show why differences between the
two Houses on important points have become more common in very recent
times.(56) The share of the Witan in early times in the appointment of
Bishops, Ealdormen, and other great officers, need hardly be dwelled
upon.For a debate in a Witenagemót of Eadward the Confessor on a
question of peace or war, see Norman Conquest, ii.For the like
under Henry the Third, see the account in Matthew Paris, in the year
1242 which will be found in Stubbs, 359.The state of the case under
Edward the Third is discussed by Hallam, Middle Ages, ii.But the most remarkable passage of all is one in the
great poetical manifesto which I have several times quoted: it is there
(Political Songs, 96) made one of the charges against Henry the Third
that he wished to keep the appointment of the great officers of state
in his own hands.The passage is long, but it is well worth quoting at
length.“Rex cum suis voluit ita liber esse;
   Et sic esse debuit, fuitque necesse
   Aut esse desineret rex, privatus jure
   Regis, nisi faceret quidquid vellet; curæ
   Non esse magnatibus regni quos præferret
   Suis comitatibus, vel quibus conferret
   Castrorum custodiam, vel quem exhibere
   Populo justitiam vellet, et habere
   Regni cancellarium thesaurariumque.Suum ad arbitrium voluit quemcumque,
   Et consiliarios de quacumque gente,
   Et ministros varios se præcipiente,
   Non intromittentibus se de factis regis
   Angliæ baronibus, vim habente legis
   Principis imperio, et quod imperaret
   Suomet arbitrio singulos ligaret.”

(57) Take for example the Act passed after Edward the Fourth’s success
at Towton.Among other things, poor Henry the Sixth
is not only branded as an usurper, but is charged with personally
stirring up the movement in the North, which led to the battle of
Wakefield and the death of Richard Duke of York.“The seid Henry
Usurpour, late called Kyng Henry the Sixt, contynuyng in his olde
rancour & malice, usyng the fraude & malicious disceit & dissimulacion
ayenst trouth & conscience, that accorde not with the honoure of eny
Cristen Prynce,... with all subtill ymaginacions & disceitfull weyes
& meanes to hym possible, intended & covertely laboured, excited &
procured the fynal destruction, murdre & deth of the seid Richard Duc,
and of his Sonnes, that is to sey, of oure seid nowe Soverayne Lord
Kyng Edward the fourth, then Erle of Marche, & of the noble Lord Edmund
Erle of Ruthlande; & for th’ execution of his dampnable & malicious
purpose, by writing & other messages, mowed, excited, & stured therunto
the Duks of Excestr’ & Somerset, & other lordes beyng then in the North
parties of this Reame.”

(58) This statute was passed in 8 Henry VI.The complaint
which it makes is well worth notice, and shows the reactionary
tendencies of the time.The county elections had been made by “very
great, outrageous, and excessive number of people dwelling within the
same counties, of which most part was people of small substance, and
of no value, whereof every of them pretended a voice equivalent, as to
such elections to be made, with the most worthy knights and esquires
dwelling within the same counties.” To hinder “the manslaughters,
riots, batteries, and divisions,” which were likely to take place—it is
not said that they had taken place—no one is to be allowed to vote who
has not “free land or tenement to the value of forty shillings by the
year at the least above all charges.” It is also provided that both the
electors and the elected are to be actually resident in the county.“Item come lez eleccions dez Chivalers des Countees esluz a venir as
parlements du Roi en plusours Countees Dengleterre, ore tarde ount
este faitz par trop graunde & excessive nombre dez gents demurrantz
deinz mesmes les Countes, dount la greindre partie estoit par gentz

chescun ait frank tenement a le valu de xl s. par an al meins outre les
reprises; & que ceux qui seront ensy esluz soient demurrantz & receantz
deins mesmes les Countes.” Revised Statutes, i.The necessity of residence in the case of either electors or
representatives was repealed by 14 Geo.The statute goes on to give the Sheriff power to examine the electors
on oath as to the amount of their property.It also gives the Judges of
Assize a power foreshadowing that of our present Election Judges, that
of inquiring into false returns made by the Sheriff.Another statute of the same kind was passed later in the same reign,
23 Henry VI.1444-5, from which it appears that the knights of
the shire were ceasing to be in all cases knights in the strict sense,
and that it was beginning to be found needful to fence them about with
oligarchic restrictions.“Issint que lez Chivalers dez Counteez pour le parlement en après a
esliers so ent notablez Chivalers dez mesmez lez Counteez pour lez
queux ils serront issint esluz, ou autrement tielx notablez Esquiers
gentils homez del Nativite dez mesmez lez Counteez comme soient ablez
destre Chivalers; et null home destre tiel Chivaler que estoise en la
degree de vadlet et desouth.” Revised Statutes, i.Every enactment of this kind bears witness to the growth of the power
of the Commons, and to the endeavours of the people to make their
representation really popular.(59) Take for instance the account given by the chronicler Hall (p.253) of the election of Edward the Fourth.“After the lordes had considered and weyghed his title and declaracion,
they determined by authoritie of the sayd counsaill, for as much as
kyng Henry, contrary to his othe, honor and agreement, had violated
and infringed, the order taken and enacted in the last Parliament,
and also, because he was insufficient to rule the Realme, & inutile
to the common wealth, & publique profite of the pore people, he was
therefore by the aforesayed authoritie, depriued & deiected of all
kyngly honor, & regall souereigntie.And incontinent, Edward erle of
Marche, sonne and heyre to Richard duke of Yorke, was by the lordes in
the sayd counsaill assembled, named, elected, & admitted, for kyng &
gouernour of the realme; on which day, the people of the erles parte,
beyng in their muster in sainct Ihons felde, & a great number of the
substanciall citezens there assembled, to behold their order: sodaynly
the lord Fawconbridge, which toke the musters, wisely declared to
the multitude, the offences & breaches of the late agremente done &
perpetrated by kyng Henry the vi.& demaunded of the people, whether
they woulde haue the sayd kyng Henry to rule & reigne any lenger ouer
them: To whome they with a whole voyce, aunswered, nay, nay.Then
he asked them, if they would serue, loue, & obey the erle of March
as their earthly prince & souereign lord.To which question they
aunswered, yea, yea, crieng, king Edward, with many great showtes and
clappyng of handes.... The erle,... as kyng, rode to the church of
sainct Paule, and there offered.And after _Te deum_ song, with great
solempnitie, he was conueyed to Westmynster, and there set in the
hawle, with the scepter royall in his hand, where to all the people
which there in a great number were assembled, his title and clayme
to the croune of England, was declared by, ii.maner of ways: the
firste, as sonne and heyre to duke Richard his father, right enheritor
to the same; the second, by aucthoritie of Parliament and forfeiture
committed by, kyng Henry.Wherupon it was agayne demaunded of the
commons, if they would admitte, and take the sayd erle as their prince
and souereigne lord, which al with one voice cried, yea, yea.... On
the morow he was proclaymed kyng by the name of kyng Edward the iiij.throughout the citie.”

This was in Lent 1461, before the battle of Towton.Edward was crowned
June 29th in the same year.The same chronicler describes the election
or acknowledgement of Richard the Third, p.(60) One special sign of the advance of the power of Parliament in the
fifteenth century was the practice of bringing in bills in the form
of Statutes ready made.Hitherto the Acts of the Commons had taken
the form of petitions, and it was sometimes found that, after the
Parliament had broken up, the petitions had been fraudulently modified.They now brought in bills, which the King accepted or rejected as they
stood.“The knight of the shire was the connecting link
between the baron and the shopkeeper.On the same benches on which
sate the goldsmiths, drapers, and grocers who had been returned to
Parliament by the commercial towns, sate also members who, in any other
country, would have been called noblemen, hereditary lords of manors,
entitled to hold courts and to bear coat armour, and able to trace
back an honourable descent through many generations.Some of them were
younger sons and brothers of great lords.Others could boast even of
royal blood.At length the eldest son of an Earl of Bedford, called
in courtesy by the second title of his father, offered himself as a
candidate for a seat in the House of Commons, and his example was
followed by others.Seated in that house, the heirs of the grandees of
the realm naturally became as zealous for its privileges as any of the
humble burgesses with whom they were mingled.”

Hallam remarks (ii.250) that it is in the reign of Edward the Fourth
that we first find borough members bearing the title of Esquire, and
he goes on to refer to the Paston Letters as showing how important
a seat in Parliament was then held, and as showing also the undue
influences which were already brought to bear upon the electors.Since
Hallam’s time, the authenticity of the Paston Letters has been called
in question, but it has, I think, been fully established.Some of the
entries are very curious indeed.96), without any date of
the year, the Duchess of Norfolk writes to John Paston, Esquire, to
use his influence at a county election on behalf of some creatures of
the Duke’s: “It is thought right necessarie for divers causes þͭ my
Lord have at this tyme in the p’lement suche p’sones as longe unto him
and be of his menyall S’vaunts wherin we conceyve yoͬ good will and
diligence shal be right expedient.” The persons to be thus chosen for
the convenience of the Duke are described as “our right wel-belovid
Cossin and S’vaunts John Howard and Syr Roger Chambirlayn.” This is
followed by a letter from the Earl of Oxford in 1455, much to the same
effect.98, we have a letter addressed to the Bailiff of Maldon,
recommending the election of Sir John Paston on behalf of a certain
great lady not named.“Ryght trusty frend I comand me to yow preyĩg yow to call to yoʳ
mynd that lyek as ye and I comonyd of it were necessary for my Lady

(62) On the effects of the reign of Charles the Fifth in Spain and
his overthrow of the liberties of Castile, see the general view in
Robertson, iii.186) he glorifies
the King’s clemency.See also the first chapter of the sixth book
of Prescott’s Philip the Second, and on the suppression of the
constitution of Aragon by Philip, Watson, Philip the Second, iii.The last meeting of the French States-General before the final meeting
in 1789 was that in 1614, during the minority of Lewis the Thirteenth.(63) The legal character of William’s despotism I have tried to set
forth almost throughout the whole of my fourth volume.8, 617; but it is plain to everyone who has the slightest knowledge
of Domesday.Nothing can show more utter ignorance of the real
character of the man and his times than the idea of William being a
mere “rude man of war,” as I have seen him called.(64) On the true aspect of the reign of Henry the Eighth I have said
something in the Fortnightly Review, September 1871.(65) Both these forms of undue influence on the part of the Crown
are set forth by Hallam, Constitutional History, i.“It will not be pretended,” he says, “that the wretched villages,
which corruption and perjury still hardly keep from famine [this was
written before the Reform Bill, in 1827], were seats of commerce and
industry in the sixteenth century.But the county of Cornwall was more
immediately subject to a coercive influence, through the indefinite and
oppressive jurisdiction of the stannary court.Similar motives, if we
could discover the secrets of those governments, doubtless operated in
most other cases.”

In the same page the historian, speaking of the different boroughs and
counties which received the franchise in the sixteenth century, says,
“It might be possible to trace the reason, why the county of Durham was
passed over.” And he suggests, “The attachment of those northern parts
to popery seems as likely as any other.” The reason for the omission
of Durham was doubtless that the Bishoprick had not wholly lost the
character of a separate principality.It was under Charles the Second
that Durham city and county, as well as Newark, first sent members to
Parliament.Durham was enfranchised by Act of Parliament, as Chester
city and county—hitherto kept distinct as being a Palatinate—were by
34 & 35 Hen.Newark was
enfranchised by a Royal Charter, the last case of that kind of exercise
of the prerogative.(66) I do not know what was the exact state of Old Sarum in 1265 or
in 1295, but earlier in the thirteenth century it was still the chief
dwelling-place both of the Earl and of the Bishop.But in the reign
of Edward the Third it had so greatly decayed that the stones of the
Cathedral were used for the completion of the new one which had arisen
in the plain.(67) On the relations between Queen Elizabeth and her Parliaments,
and especially for the bold bearing of the two Wentworths, Peter and
Paul, see the fifth chapter of Hallam’s Constitutional History, largely
grounded on the Journals of Sir Simonds D’Ewes.The frontispiece to
D’Ewes’ book (London, 1682) gives a lively picture of a Parliament of
those days.(68) On the relations between the Crown and the House of Commons under
James the First, see the sixth chapter of Hallam’s Constitutional
History, and the fifth chapter of Gardner’s History of England from
1603 to 1616.(1) This was the famous motion made by Sir Robert Peel against the
Ministry of Lord Melbourne, and carried by a majority of one, June 4,
1841.See May’s Constitutional History, i.Irving’s Annals of our
Times, 86.(2) This of course leaves to the Ministry the power of appealing to the
country by a dissolution of Parliament; but, if the new Parliament also
declares against them, it is plain that they have nothing to do but to
resign office.In the case of 1841 Lord Melbourne dissolved Parliament,
and, on the meeting of the new Parliament, an amendment to the address
was carried by a majority of ninety-one, August 28, 1841.(3) This is well set forth by Sir John Fortescue, De Laudibus Legum
Angliæ, cap.36: “Neque Rex ibidem, per se aut ministros suos,
tallegia, subsidia, aut quævis onera alia, imponit legiis suis, aut
leges eorum mutat, vel novas condit, sine concessione vel assensu
totius regni sui in parliamento suo expresso.”

(4) How very recent the establishment of these principles is will be
seen by anyone who studies the history of the reign of George the Third
in the work of Sir T. E. May.Pitt, as is well known, kept office
in defiance of repeated votes of the House of Commons, and at last, by
a dissolution at a well-chosen moment, showed that the country was on
his side.Such conduct would not be deemed constitutional now, but the
wide difference between the constitution of the House of Commons then
and now should be borne in mind.(5) Though the command of the Sovereign would be no excuse for any
illegal act, and though the advisers of any illegal act are themselves
responsible for it, yet there would seem to be no way provided for
punishing an illegal act done by the Sovereign in his own person.The
Sovereign may therefore be said to be personally irresponsible.(6) See Macaulay, iv.It should not be forgotten that writers like
Blackstone and De Lolme say nothing about the Cabinet.Serjeant Stephen
supplies the omission, ii.(7) The lowly outward position of the really ruling assembly comes out
in some degree at the opening of every session of Parliament.But it is
far more marked in the grotesque, and probably antiquated, ceremonies
of a Conference of the two Houses.This comes out most curiously of all
in the Conference between the two Houses of the Convention in 1688.(8) See Note 56, Chapter ii.(9) See Macaulay, iv.(10) “Ministers” or “Ministry” were the words always used at the
time of the Reform Bill in 1831-1832.It would be curious to trace
at what time the present mode of speech came into vogue, either in
parliamentary debates or in common speech.Another still later change marks a step toward the recognition of the
Cabinet.It has long been held that a Secretary of State must always
accompany the Sovereign everywhere.It is now beginning to be held that
any member of the Cabinet will do as well as a Secretary of State.But
if any member of the Cabinet, why not any Privy Councillor?Cayley moved for a “Select Committee to
consider the duties of the Member leading the Government business in
this House, and the expediency of attaching office and salary thereto.”
The motion was withdrawn, after being opposed by Sir Charles Wood
(now Viscount Halifax), Mr.Walpole, and Lord John Russell (now Earl
Russell).Sir Charles Wood described the post of Leader of the House
as “an office that does not exist, and the duties of which cannot be
defined.” Mr.Walpole spoke of it as a “position totally unknown to the
constitution of the country.” Yet I presume that everybody practically
knew that Lord John Russell was Leader of the House, though nobody
could give a legal definition of his position.Walpole and Lord John Russell on the nature of
ministerial responsibility.Walpole said that “members were apt to
talk gravely of ministerial responsibility; but responsibility there is
none, except by virtue of the office that a Minister holds, or possibly
by the fact of his being a Privy Councillor.A Minister is responsible
for the acts done by him; a Privy Councillor for advice given by him in
that capacity.Until the reign of Charles the Second, Privy Councillors
always signed the advice they gave; and to this day the Cabinet is not
a body recognised by law.As a Privy Councillor, a person is under
little or no responsibility for the acts advised by him, on account of
the difficulty of proof.” Lord John Russell “asked the House to pause
before it gave assent to the constitutional doctrines laid down by Mr.He unduly restricted the responsibility of Ministers.”... “I
hold,” continued Lord John, “that it is not really for the business the
Minister transacts in performing the particular duties of his office,
but it is for any advice which he has given, and which he may be
proved, before a Committee of this House, or at the bar of the House of
Lords, to have given, that he is responsible, and for which he suffers
the penalties that may ensue from impeachment.”

It is plain that both Mr.Walpole and Lord Russell were here speaking
of real legal responsibility, such responsibility as might be enforced
by impeachment or other legal process, not of the vaguer kind of
responsibility which is commonly meant when we speak of Ministers being
“responsible to the House of Commons.” This last is enforced, not by
legal process, but by such motions as that of Sir Robert Peel in 1841,
or that of the Marquess of Hartington in June 1859.I have made my extracts from the Spectator newspaper of February 11,
1854.(12) We read (Anglia Sacra, i.335) of Æthelric, Bishop of the
South-Saxons at the time of the Conquest, as “vir antiquissimus et
legum terræ sapientissimus.” So Adelelm, the first Norman Abbot of
Abingdon, found much benefit from the legal knowledge of certain of his
English monks (Chronicon Monasterii de Abingdon, ii.2), “quibus tanta
secularium facundia et præteritorum memoria eventorum inerat, ut cæteri
circumquaque facile eorum sententiam ratam fuisse, quam edicerent,
approbarent.” The writer adds, “Sed et alii plures de Anglis causidici
per id tempus in abbatia ista habebantur quorum collationi nemo sapiens
refragabatur.” But knowledge of the law was not an exclusively clerical
accomplishment; for among the grounds for the election of King Harold
himself, we find (de Inventione Sanctæ Crucis Walthamensis, p.25,
Stubbs) that one was “quia non erat eo prudentior in terra, armis
strenuus magis, legum terræ sagacior.” See Norman Conquest, ii.(13) On the growth of the lawyers’ theory of the royal prerogative, and
its utter lack of historical standing-ground, I must refer once for all
to Allen’s Inquiry into the Rise and Growth of the Royal Prerogative in
England.(15) The history of this memorable revolution will be found in
Lingard, iii.392-405, and the legal points are brought out by Hallam,
Middle Ages, ii.He remarks that “In this revolution of 1399
there was as remarkable an attention shown to the formalities of the
constitution, allowance made for the men and the times, as in that
of 1688;” and, speaking of the device by which the same Parliament
was brought together again, he adds, “In this contrivance, more than
in all the rest, we may trace the hand of lawyers.” The official
version entered on the rolls of Parliament by command of Henry will
be found in Walsingham, ii.Some care seems to be used to
avoid using the name of Parliament in the account of the actual
proceedings.It is said just before, “Rex perductus est Londonias,
conservandus in Turri usque ad Parliamentum proximo celebrandum.”
And the writs are said to have been sent “ad personas regni qui de
jure debeant interesse Parliamento.” But when they have come together
(“quibus convenientibus”) care seems to be taken to give the Assembly
no particular name, till, in the Act of Richard’s deposition, the
actors are described as “pares et proceres regni Angliæ spirituales
et temporales, et ejus regni communitates, omnes status ejusdem regni
repræsentantes;” and in the Act of Henry’s election they are described
as “domini tam spirituales quam temporales, et omnes regni status.” In
the Act of deposition Richard’s resignation of the Crown is recorded,
as well as his particular crimes and his general unfitness to wear it,
all which are classed together as reasons for his deposition.The
actual formula of deposition runs thus:—“propter præmissa, et eorum
prætextu, ab omni dignitate et honore regiis, _si quid dignitatis et
honoris hujusmodi in eo remanserit_, merito deponendum pronunciamus,
decernimus, et declaramus; et etiam simili cautela deponimus.” They
then declare the throne to be vacant (“ut constabat de præmissis,
et eorum occasione, regnum Angliæ, cum pertinentiis suis, vacare”).Henry then makes his challenge, setting forth that strange mixture of
titles which is commented on in most narratives of the event, and the
Estates, without saying which of Henry’s arguments they accept, grant
the kingdom to him (“concesserunt unanimiter ut Dux præfatus super eos
regnaret”).A more distinct case of deposition and election can hardly
be found; only in the words which I have put in italics there seems a
sort of anxiety to complete, by the act of deposition, any possible
defect in Richard’s doubtless unwilling abdication.The French narrative by a partisan of Richard (Lystoire de la Traison
et Mort du Roy Richart Dengleterre, p.68) gives, in some respects, a
different account.The Assembly is called a Parliament, and the Duke
of Lancaster is made to seat himself on the throne at once.Then Sir
Thomas Percy “cria ‘Veez Henry de Lencastre Roy Dengleterre.’ Adonc
crierent tous les seigneurs prelaz et _le commun de Londres_, Ouy Ouy
nous voulons que Henry duc de Lencastre soit nostre Roy et nul autre.”
For “le commun de Londres” there are other readings, “le commun,” “le
commun Dangleterre et de Londres,” and “tout le commun et conseil de
Londres.”

(16) It should be remembered that Charles the First was not deposed,
but was executed being King.He was called King both in the indictment
at his trial and in the warrant of his beheading.(17) Monk raised this point in 1660.612) remarks that at this particular moment “there
was no court to influence, no interference of the military to control
the elections.” The Convention may therefore be supposed to have been
more freely elected than most Parliaments.(19) The Long Parliament had dissolved itself, and had decreed the
election of its successor.733) the Long Parliament is “declared and adjudged to be fully
dissolved and determined;” but it is not said when it was dissolved and
determined.5; Hallam’s Constitutional History,
ii.21, where the whole matter is discussed, and it is remarked that
“the next Parliament never gave their predecessors any other name in
the Journals than ‘the late assembly.’”

(20) See Norman Conquest, i.(21) See the discussion on the famous vote of the Convention Parliament
in Hallam, Constitutional History, ii.Hallam remarks that “the word ‘forfeiture’ might better have answered
this purpose than ‘abdication’ or ‘desertion,’” and he adds, “they
proceeded not by the stated rules of the English government, but by
the general rights of mankind.They looked not so much to Magna Charta
as the original compact of society, and rejected Coke and Hale for
Hooker and Harrington.” My position is that there is no need to go to
what Hallam calls “higher constitutional laws” for the justification
of the doings of the Convention, but that they were fully justified
by the precedents of English History from the eighth century to the
fourteenth.The Scottish Estates, it should be remembered, did not shrink from
using the word “forfeited.” Macaulay, iii.(22) See the Act 1 William and Mary “for removing and preventing all
Questions and Disputes concerning the Assembling and Sitting of this
Present Parliament” (Revised Statutes, ii.It decrees “That the
Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons convened at Westminster the
two and twentieth day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand
six hundred eighty-eight, and there sitting on the thirteenth day of
February following, are the two Houses of Parliament, and so shall be
and are hereby declared enacted and adjudged to be to all intents,
constructions, and purposes whatsoever, notwithstanding any fault of
writ or writs of summons, or any defect of form or default whatsoever,
as if they had been summoned according to the usual form.” The whole
history of the question is given in Macaulay, iii.The whole
matter is summed up in the words (iii.27), “It was answered that the
royal writ was mere matter of form, and that to expose the substance
of our laws and liberties to serious hazard for the sake of a form
would be the most senseless superstition.Wherever the Sovereign, the
Peers spiritual and temporal, and the Representatives freely chosen by
the constituent bodies of the realm were met together, there was the
essence of a Parliament.” In earlier times it might perhaps have been
held that there might be the essence of a Parliament even without the
Sovereign.“A paper had been circulated, in which the
logic of a small sharp pettifogger was employed to prove that writs,
issued in the joint names of William and Mary, ceased to be of force
as soon as William reigned alone.But this paltry cavil had completely
failed.It had not even been mentioned in the Lower House, and had been
mentioned in the Upper only to be contemptuously overruled.” From my
point of view the cavil is certainly paltry, but it is hard to see that
it is more paltry than the others.(24) This is by the Acts 7 and 8 Will.See Stephen’s Commentaries, ii.Blackstone’s
reasoning runs thus: “This dissolution formerly happened immediately
upon the death of the reigning sovereign; for he being considered in
law as the head of the parliament (caput principium, et finis), that
failing, the whole body was held to be extinct.But the calling a new
parliament immediately on the inauguration of the successor being found
inconvenient, and dangers being apprehended from having no parliament
in being, in case of a disputed succession, it was enacted,” etc.By
the Reform Act of 1867 the whole tradition of the lawyers was swept
away.(25) I have said something on this head in Norman Conquest, i.94,
but the whole thing should be studied in Allen’s great section on the
Tenure of Landed Property; Royal Prerogative, 125-155.It is to Allen
that the honour belongs of showing what _bookland_ and _folkland_
really were.(26) I have given a few examples in Norman Conquest, i.Endless
examples will be found in Kemble’s Codex Diplomaticus.(27) See the complaints on this head as late as the time of William
the Third, in Macaulay, iv.On the Acts by which the power of the
Crown in this matter is restrained, see Stephen’s Commentaries, ii.See also May’s Constitutional History, i.(29) This is discussed in full by Allen, Royal Prerogative, 143-145.The great example is the will of King Ælfred.249; Allen, 154-155, who remarks: “By a singular
revolution of policy there was a recurrence in the late reign to the
ancient policy of the Anglo-Saxons.The crown lands were virtually
restored to the public, while the King obtained the right of acquiring
landed property by purchase, and of bequeathing it by will like a
private person.”

(31) Edward the First was the earliest King whose reign is dated from
a time earlier than his coronation.He was out of the kingdom at his
father’s death, and his right was acknowledged without opposition.But
even in this case there was an interregnum.The regnal years of Edward
the First are not reckoned from the day of his father’s death, but
from the day of his funeral, when Edward was acknowledged King, and
when the prelates and nobles swore allegiance to him.See the account
in the Worcester Annals, Annales Monastici, iv.462, and the documents
in Rymer, i. part ii.See also the remarks of Allen, 46, 47.The
doctrine that there can be no interregnum seems to have been put into
shape to please James the First, and it was of course altogether upset
by the great vote of 1688.Now of course there is no interregnum; not
indeed from any mysterious prerogative of the Crown, but simply because
the Act of Settlement has entailed the Crown in a particular way.(32) On this see Norman Conquest, i.See the same
question discussed in quite another part of the world in Herodotus,
vii.(33) The helpless way in which Blackstone himself wrote was perhaps
pardonable in the dark times in which he lived.But it is really too
bad when lawyer after lawyer, in successive editions, gives again to
the world the astounding rubbish which in Blackstone’s day passed
for early constitutional history.In Kerr’s edition of Blackstone,
published in 1857, vol.180, I find repeated, without alteration
or comment, the monstrous assertion of Blackstone: “I believe there
is no instance wherein the Crown of England has ever been asserted to
be elective, except by the regicides at the infamous and unparalleled
trial of King Charles I.” And in Serjeant Stephen’s Commentaries
(1853), which are not a mere edition of Blackstone, but “New
Commentaries partly founded on Blackstone,” the same words are found
in vol.403, only leaving out the epithet “unparalleled,” which
might with truth have been allowed to stay.481-2) we read how “after the Saxon government was firmly established
in this island” came “the subdivision of the kingdom into a heptarchy,
consisting of seven independent kingdoms, peopled and governed by
different clans and colonies.” It seems then that in 1857 there
were learned gentlemen who believed in a kingdom subdivided into a
heptarchy.But when, in the next page, Blackstone tells us how Ælfred
set about “to new-model the constitution, to rebuild it on a plan that
should endure for ages,” and goes on in the usual style to attribute
everything whatever to Ælfred personally, this seems to have been too
much, and the editor gives an extract from Kemble by way of correction.One wonders that, if he had read Kemble at all, he had not learned a
little more from him.It is amusing again when Blackstone tells us (i.186, Kerr), “From Egbert to the death of Edmund Ironside, a period
of above two hundred years, the Crown descended regularly through a
succession of fifteen princes, without any deviation or interruption:
save only”—all the cases where it did not descend regularly, according
to Blackstone’s notions of regularity: But it is almost more amusing
when Serjeant Stephen (ii.410) throws Blackstone’s exceptions, which
are at least historical facts, into a note, and gives us instead as
his own exceptions, the statement, very doubtful and, if true, utterly
irrelevant, that Æthelstan and Eadmund Ironside were illegitimate (see
Norman Conquest, i.We of course get the usual talk about the
usurpations of Harold, Stephen, John, and Henry the Fourth, and about
the rights of Eadgar and Arthur of Britanny.For the former we get a
quotation from Matthew Paris, to whom it would have been more to the
purpose to go for the great speech of Archbishop Hubert.The comments
on the succession of John (i.189, Kerr) are singularly amusing, but
too long to quote.To prove the strictly hereditary
nature of the succession, Blackstone (i.189, Kerr) quotes the Statute
of 25 Edward III.“that the law of the Crown of England is, and always
hath been, that the children of the King of England, whether born in
England or elsewhere, ought to bear the inheritance after the death of
their ancestors.” We are bound to suppose that these learned lawyers
had read through the statute which they quoted; but it is wonderful
that they did not see that it had nothing whatever to do with fixing
the hereditary succession of the Crown.The original text (Revised
Statutes, i.176) runs thus:—

“La lei de la Corone Dengleterre est, et ad este touz jours tiele,
que les enfantz des Rois Dengleterre, _queu part qils soient neez en
Engleterre ou aillors_, sont ables et deivent porter heritage, apres la
mort lour auncestors.”

The object of the statute is something quite different from what any
one would think from Blackstone’s way of quoting it.The emphatic words
are those which are put in italics.The object of the statute is to
make the King’s children and others born of English parents beyond sea
capable of inheriting in England.As far as the succession to the Crown
is concerned, its effect is simply to put a child of the King born out
of the realm on a level with his brother born in the realm; that is,
in the view of our older Law, to give both alike the preference due to
an Ætheling.(34) It is as well to explain this, because most people seem to think
that a man becomes a Bishop by virtue of receiving a private letter
from the First Lord of the Treasury.We constantly see a man spoken of
as Bishop of such a see, and his works advertised as such, before a
single ecclesiastical or legal step has been taken to make him so.(36) The succession of a grandson, which first took place in England in
the case of Richard the Second, marks a distinct stage in the growth
of the doctrine of hereditary right.It involves the doctrine of
representation, which is a very subtle and technical one, and is not
nearly so obvious or so likely to occur in an early state of society
as the doctrine of nearness of kin.No opposition was made to the
accession of Richard the Second, but there seems to have been a strong
notion in men’s minds that John of Gaunt sought to displace his nephew.In earlier times, as the eldest and most eminent of the surviving sons
of Edward the Third, John would probably have been elected without any
thought of the claims of young Richard.(37) In Yorkist official language the three Lancastrian Kings were
usurpers, and Duke Richard was _de jure_, though not _de facto_, King.Henry the Sixth is, in the Act of 1461, “Henry Usurpour, late called
Kyng Henry the sixt.” The claim of the House of York was through an
intricate female descent from Lionel Duke of Clarence, a son of Edward
the Third older than John of Gaunt.A claim so purely technical had
never been set forth before; but we may be quite sure that it would not
have been thought to have much weight, if Duke Richard had not been, by
another branch, descended from Edward the Third in the male line, and
if he had not moreover been the ablest and most popular nobleman in the
country.(38) A prospective election before the vacancy of course hindered
any interregnum.In this case the formula “Le Roi est mort; vive le
Roi,” was perfectly true.The new King was already chosen and crowned,
and he had nothing to do but to go on reigning singly instead of in
partnership with his father, just as William went on reigning alone
after the death of Mary.In Germany this took place whenever a King
of the Romans was chosen in the lifetime of the reigning Emperor.In
France, under the early Kings of the Parisian dynasty, the practice
was specially common, and the fact that there seldom or never was an
interregnum doubtless helped much to make the French Crown become, as
it did, the most strictly hereditary crown in Christendom.In England,
the only distinct case of a coronation of a son during the lifetime of
his father was that of Henry, the son of Henry the Second, known as the
younger King, and sometimes as Henry the Third.In earlier times we get
something like it in the settlement of the Crown by Æthelwulf, with the
consent of his Witan (see Old-English History, 105, 106), but it does
not seem clear whether there was in this case any actual coronation
during the father’s lifetime.If there was not, this would be the case
most like that of Duke Richard.The compromise placed the Duke in the
same position as if he had been Prince of Wales, or rather in a better
position, for it might be held to shut out the need of even a formal
election on the King’s death.(39) See note 59 on Chapter II.(41) See Hallam’s Constitutional History, i.It is to be noticed
that the settlement enacts that “the inheritance of the Crown, &c.,
should remain in Henry the Seventh and the heirs of his body for ever,
and in none other.” This would seem to bar a great number of contingent
claims in various descendants of earlier Kings.As it happens, this Act
has been literally carried out, for every later Sovereign of England
has been a descendant of the body of Henry the Seventh.(42) The will of Henry the Eighth is fully discussed by Hallam, i.34,
288, 294; Lingard, vi.There are two Acts of Henry’s reign bearing
on the matter.7, the Crown is
entailed on the King’s sons by Jane Seymour or any other wife; then
on the King’s legitimate daughters, no names being mentioned; the Act
then goes on to say, “your Highnes shall have full and plenar power
and auctorite to geve despose appoynte assigne declare and lymytt by
your letters patentes under your great seale or ells by your laste Will
made in wrytynge and signed with your moste gracious hande, at your
onely pleasure from tyme to tyme herafter, the imperiall Crowne of this
Realme and all other the premisses thereunto belongyng, to be remayne
succede and come after your decease and for lack of lawfull heires of
your body to be procreated and begoten as is afore lymytted by this
Acte, to such person or persones in possession and remaynder as shall
please your Highnes and according to such estate and after such maner
forme facion ordre and condicion as shalbe expressed declared named and
lymytted in your said letters patentes or by your said laste will.”
The later Act, 35 Henry VIII.1, puts Henry’s two daughters, Mary
and Elizabeth, into the entail, but in a very remarkable way.The Acts
declaring their illegitimacy are not repealed, nor is the legitimacy of
either of them in any way asserted; in fact it is rather denied when
the preamble rehearses that “The king’s Majesty hath only issue of his
body lawfully begotten betwixt his Highness and his said late wife
Queen Jane the noble and excellent Prince Edward.” The Act then goes
on to enact that, although the King had been enabled to “dispose” the
Crown “to any person or persons of such estate therein as should please
his Highness to limit and appoint,” yet that, in failure of heirs of
the body of either the King or his son, “the said imperial Crown and
all other the premises shall be to the Lady Mary the King’s Highness
daughter, and to the heirs of the body of the same Lady Mary lawfully
begotten, with such conditions as by his Highness shall be limited by
his letters patents under his great seal, or by his Majesty’s last will
in writing signed with his gracious hand.” Failing Mary and her issue,
the same conditional entail is extended to Elizabeth and her issue.The
power of creating a remainder after the issue of Elizabeth of course
remained with Henry, and he exercised it in favour of the issue of his
younger sister Mary.Mary and Elizabeth therefore really reigned, not
by virtue of any royal descent, but by virtue of a particular entail by
which the Crown was settled on the King’s illegitimate daughters, as it
might have been settled on a perfect stranger.It was an attempt on the
part of Edward the Sixth to do without parliamentary authority what his
father had done by parliamentary authority which led to the momentary
occupation of the throne by Lady Jane Grey.Mary, on her accession,
raked up the whole story of her mother’s marriage and divorce, and the
Act of the first year of her reign recognized her as inheriting by
legitimate succession.The Act passed on the accession of Elizabeth,
1 Eliz.It enacts “that your majestie our sayd
Sovereigne Ladye ys and in verye dede and of most meere right ought
to bee by the Lawes of God and the Lawes and Statutes of this Realme
our most rightfull and lawfull Sovereigne liege Ladie and Quene; and
that your Highness ys rightlye lynyallye and lawfully discended and
come of the bloodd royall of this Realme of Englande in and to whose
princely person and theires of your bodye lawfully to bee begotten
after youe without all doubte ambiguitee scruple or question the
imperiall and Royall estate place crowne and dignitie of this Reallme
withe all honnours stiles titles dignities Regalities Jurisdiccons and
preheminences to the same nowe belonging & apperteyning arre & shalbee
most fully rightfully really & entierly invested & incorporated united
& annexed as rightfully & lawfully to all intentes construccons &
purposes as the same were in the said late Henrye theight or in the
late King Edwarde the Syxte your Highnes Brother, or in the late Quen
Marye your Highnes syster at anye tyme since thacte of parliament made
in the xxxvth yere of the reigne of your said most noble father king
Henrye theight.”

It should be remembered that Sir Thomas More, though he refused to
swear to the preamble of the oath prescribed by the Act of Supremacy,
was ready to swear to the order of succession which entailed the Crown
on the issue of Anne Boleyn.On his principles the issue of Anne Boleyn
would be illegitimate; but he also held that Parliament could settle
the Crown upon anybody, on an illegitimate child of the King or on an
utter stranger; to the succession therefore he had no objection to
swear.For a parallel to the extraordinary power thus granted to Henry we have
to go back to the days of Æthelwulf.(43) The position of the daughters of Henry the Eighth was of course
practically affected by the fact that each was the child of a mother
who was acknowledged as a lawful wife at the time of her daughter’s
birth.There was manifest harshness in ranking children so born with
ordinary illegitimate children; but, in strictness of Law, as Henry
married Anne Boleyn while Katharine of Aragon was alive, the daughter
of Katharine and the daughter of Anne could not both be legitimate.It should also be
remembered that the marriage of Anne Boleyn was declared void, and her
daughter declared illegitimate, on grounds—whatever they were—which had
nothing to do with the earlier question of the marriage and divorce of
Katharine.1, declares it to be treason “yf any person shall in any wyse holde
and affyrme or mayntayne that the Common Lawes of this Realme not
altred by Parlyament, ought not to dyrecte the Ryght of the crowne
of England, or that our said sovrayne Ladye Elizabeth the Quenes
Majestie that nowe is, with and by the aucthoritye of the Parlyament
of Englande is not able to make Lawes and Statutes of suffycyent force
and valyditie to lymit and bynd the Crowne of this Realme, and the
Descent Lymitacion Inheritaunce and Government thereof.” The like is
the crime of “whosoever shall hereafter duryng the Lyef of our said
Soveraigne Ladye, by any Booke or Worke prynted or written, dyrectly
and expresly declare and affyrme at any tyme before the same be by Acte
of Parlyament of this Realme established and affyrmed, that any one
particular person whosover it be, is or ought to be the ryght Heire
and Successor to the Queenes Majestie that nowe is (whome God longe
preserve) except the same be the naturall yssue of her Majesties bodye.”

This statute may possibly be taken as setting aside the claims of the
House of Suffolk; but, if so, it sets aside the claims of the House of
Stewart along with them.(45) James’s right was acknowledged by his own first Parliament, just
as the claims of other Kings who entered in an irregular way had
been.It should be marked however that he was crowned before he was
acknowledged.1, declares that “immediatelie upon
the Dissolution and Decease of Elizabeth late Queene of England, the
Imperiall Crowne of the Realme of England, and of all the Kingdomes
Dominions and Rights belonging to the same, did by inherent Birthright
and lawfull undoubted Succession, descend and come to your moste
excellent Majestie, as beinge lineallie justly and lawfullie next and
sole Heire of the Blood Royall of this Realme as is aforesaid.” It is
worth noticing that in this Act we get the following definition of
Parliament; “this high Court of Parliament, where all the whole Body of
the Realm and every particular member thereof, either in Person or by
Representation (upon their own free elections), are by the Laws of this
Realm deemed to be personally present.”

(46) The fact that James the First, a King who came in with no title
whatever but what was given him by an Act of Parliament passed after
his coronation, was acknowledged without the faintest opposition is
one of the most remarkable things in our history.294)
remarks that “there is much reason to believe that the consciousness of
this defect in his parliamentary title put James on magnifying, still
more than from his natural temper he was prone to do, the inherent
rights of primogenitory succession, as something indefeasible by the
legislature; a doctrine which, however it might suit the schools of
divinity, was in diametrical opposition to our statutes.” Certainly no
opposition can be more strongly marked than that between the language
of James’s own Parliament and the words quoted above from 13 Eliz.But see the remarks of Hallam a few pages before (i.288) on the
kind of tacit election by which it might be said that James reigned.“What renders it absurd to call him and his children usurpers?He had
that which the flatterers of his family most affected to disdain—the
will of the people; not certainly expressed in regular suffrage or
declared election, but unanimously and voluntarily ratifying that which
in itself could surely give no right, the determination of the late
Queen’s Council to proclaim his accession to the throne.”

(47) Whitelocke’s Memorials, 367.“The heads of the charge against the
King were published by leave, in this form: That Charles Stuart, being
admitted King of England, & therein trusted with a limited power, to
govern by, & according to the Laws of the Land, & not otherwise, &
by his trust being obliged, as also by his Oath, & office to use the
power committed to him, for the good & benefit of the people, & for the
preservation of their Rights and Privileges,” etc.At an earlier stage (365) the President had told the King that the
Court “sat here by the Authority of the Commons of England: & all your
predecessours, & you are responsible to them.” The King answered “I
deny that, shew me one Precedent.” The President, instead of quoting
the precedents which were at least plausible, told the prisoner that
he was not to interrupt the Court.Earlier still the King had objected
to the authority of the Court that “he saw no Lords there which should
make a Parliament, including the King, & urged that the Kingdom
of England was hereditary, & not successive.” The strong point of
Charles’s argument undoubtedly was the want of concurrence on the part
of the Lords.Both Houses of Parliament had agreed in the proceedings
against Edward the Second and Richard the Second.It is a small point, but it is well to notice that the description of
the King as Charles Stewart was perfectly accurate.Charles, the son
of James, the son of Henry Stewart Lord Darnley, really had a surname,
though it might not be according to Court etiquette to call him by
it.The helpless French imitators in 1793 summoned their King by the
name of “Louis Capet,” as if Charles had been summoned by the name of
“Unready,” “Bastard,” “Lackland,” “Longshanks,” or any other nickname
of an earlier King and forefather.I believe that many people fancy that Guelph or Welf is a surname of
the present, or rather late, royal family.(48) The Act 1 William and Mary (Revised Statutes, ii.11) entailed the
Crown “after their deceases,” “to the heires of the body of the said
princesse & for default of such issue to the Princesse Anne of Denmarke
& the heires of her body & for default of such issue to the heires of
the body of the said Prince of Orange.” It was only after the death of
“the most hopeful Prince William Duke of Gloucester” that the Crown
was settled (12 and 13 Will.94) on
“the most excellent Princess Sophia Electress and Dutchess Dowager of
Hannover, daughter of the most excellent Princess Elizabeth, late Queen
of Bohemia, daughter of our late sovereign lord King James the First of
happy memory,” “and the heirs of her body being protestants.”

(49) We hardly need assurance of the fact, but if it were needed,
something like an assurance to that effect was given by an official
member of the House during the session of 1872.At all events we
read in Sir T. E. May (ii.83); “The increased power of the House
of Commons, under an improved representation, has been patent and
indisputable.Responsible to the people, it has, at the same time,
wielded the people’s strength.No longer subservient to the crown, the
ministers, and the peerage, it has become the predominant authority
in the state.” But the following strange remark follows: “But it is
characteristic of the British constitution, and _a proof of its
freedom from the spirit of democracy_, that the more dominant the power
of the House of Commons,—the greater has been its respect for the law,
and the more carefully have its acts been restrained within the proper
limits of its own jurisdiction.”

  ὦ δημοκρατία, ταῦτα δῆτ' ἀνασχετά;

Has Mr.Grote lived and written so utterly in vain that a writer widely
indeed removed from the vulgar herd of oligarchic babblers looks on
“the spirit of democracy” as something inconsistent with “respect for
the law”?(50) The story is told (Plutarch, Lycurgus, 7), that King Theopompos,
having submitted to the lessening of the kingly power by that of the
Ephors, was rebuked by his wife, because the power which he handed on
to those who came after him would be less than what he had received
from those who went before him.ὃν καί φασιν ὑπὸ τῆς ἑαυτοῦ γυναικὸς

the comment, ὅσῳ γὰρ ἂν ἐλαττόνων ὦσι κύριοι, πλείω χρόνον ἀναγκαῖον

αὐτήν.The kingdom of the Molossians, referred to in the extract from
Aristotle, is one of those states of antiquity of which we should
be well pleased to hear more.Like the Macedonian kingdom, it was an
instance of the heroic kingship surviving into the historical ages of
Greece.But the Molossian kingship seems to have been more regular and
popular than that of Macedonia, and to have better deserved the name
of a constitutional monarchy.The Molossian people and the Molossian
King exchanged oaths not unlike those of the Landesgemeinde and the
Landammann of Appenzell-Ausserrhoden, the King swearing to rule
according to the laws, and the people swearing to maintain the kingdom
according to the laws.In the end the kingdom changed into a Federal
Republic.(51) It is simply frivolous in the present state of England to discuss
the comparative merits of commonwealths and constitutional monarchies
with any practical object.Constitutional monarchy is not only firmly
fixed in the hearts of the people, but it has some distinct advantages
over republican forms of government, just as republican forms of
government have some advantages over it.It may be doubted whether
the people have not a more real control over the Executive, when the
House of Commons, or, in the last resort, the people itself in the
polling-booths (as in 1868), can displace a Government at any moment,
than they have in constitutions in which an Executive, however much
it may have disappointed the hopes of those who chose it, cannot be
removed before the end of its term of office, except on the legal
proof of some definite crime.But in itself, there really seems no
reason why the form of the Executive Government should not be held
to be as lawful a subject for discussion as the House of Lords, the
Established Church, the standing army, or anything else.It shows
simple ignorance, if it does not show something worse, when the word
“republican” is used as synonymous with cut-throat or pickpocket.I do
not find that in republican countries this kind of language is applied
to the admirers of monarchy; but the people who talk in this way are
just those who have no knowledge of republics either in past history or
in present times.They may very likely have climbed a Swiss mountain,
but they have taken care not to ask what was the constitution of the
country at its foot.They may even have learned to write Greek iambics
and to discuss Greek particles; but they have learned nothing from
the treasures of wisdom taught by Grecian history from Herodotus to
Polybios.I have discussed the three chief forms of executive government, the
constitutional King and his Ministry, the President, and the Executive
Council, in the last of my first series of Historical Essays.250:—

MACMILLAN AND CO., LONDON.Thou art now arriv'd
Under the hemisphere opposed to that,
Which the great continent doth overspread,
And underneath whose canopy expir'd
The Man, that was born sinless, and so liv'd.Thy feet are planted on the smallest sphere,
Whose other aspect is Judecca.Morn
Here rises, when there evening sets: and he,
Whose shaggy pile was scal'd, yet standeth fix'd,
As at the first.On this part he fell down
From heav'n; and th' earth, here prominent before,
Through fear of him did veil her with the sea,
And to our hemisphere retir'd.Perchance
To shun him was the vacant space left here
By what of firm land on this side appears,
That sprang aloof."There is a place beneath,
From Belzebub as distant, as extends
The vaulted tomb, discover'd not by sight,
But by the sound of brooklet, that descends
This way along the hollow of a rock,
Which, as it winds with no precipitous course,
The wave hath eaten.By that hidden way
My guide and I did enter, to return
To the fair world: and heedless of repose
We climbed, he first, I following his steps,
Till on our view the beautiful lights of heav'n
Dawn'd through a circular opening in the cave:
Thus issuing we again beheld the stars.Without it at present a man or a nation was intellectually and
spiritually all abroad.If they saw it accompanied in France by much
that they shrank from, they should reflect that in England it would
have influences joined with it which it had not in France--the natural
seriousness of the people, their sense of reverence and respect, their
love for the past.Come it must; and here where it had been so late in
coming, it would probably be for the first time seen to come without
danger.Capitals were natural centers of mental movement, and it was natural for
the classes with most leisure, most freedom, most means of cultivation,
and most conversance with the wide world to have lucidity though often
they had it not.To generate a spirit of lucidity in provincial towns,
and among the middle classes bound to a life of much routine and plunged
in business, was more difficult.Schools and universities, with serious
and disinterested studies, and connecting those studies the one with the
other and continuing them into years of manhood, were in this case the
best agency they could use.It might be slow, but it was sure.Such
an agency they were now going to employ.Might it fulfill all their
expectations!Might their students, in the words quoted just now,
advance in every direction with a marvelous vigor, and with that
conquering ambition which Vico called _mens heroica_!And among the many
good results of this, might one result be the acquisition in their midst
of that indispensable spirit--the spirit of lucidity!*       *       *       *       *




ON SOME APPARATUS THAT PERMIT OF ENTERING FLAMES.[Footnote: A. de Rochas in the _Revue Scientifique_.]In the following notes I shall recall a few experiments that indicate
under what conditions the human organism is permitted to remain unharmed
amid flames.These experiments were published in England in 1882, in the
twelfth letter from Brewster to Walter Scott on natural magic.They are,
I believe, not much known in France, and possess a practical interest
for those who are engaged in the art of combating fires.At the end of the last century Humphry Davy observed that, on placing a
very fine wire gauze over a flame, the latter was cooled to such a
point that it could not traverse the meshes.This phenomenon, which he
attributed to the conductivity and radiating power of the metal, he soon
utilized in the construction of a lamp for miners.Some years afterward Chevalier Aldini, of Milan, conceived the idea of
making a new application of Davy's discovery in the manufacture of an
envelope that should permit a man to enter into the midst of flames.This envelope, which was made of metallic gauze with 1-25th of an inch
meshes, was composed of five pieces, as follows: (1) a helmet, with
mask, large enough, to allow a certain space between it and the internal
bonnet of which I shall speak; (2) a cuirass with armlets; (3) a skirt
for the lower part of the belly and the thighs; (4) a pair of boots
formed of a double wire gauze; and (5) a shield five feet long by one
and a half wide, formed of metallic gauze stretched over a light iron
frame.Beneath this armor the experimenter was clad in breeches and a
close coat of coarse cloth that had previously been soaked in a solution
of alum.The head, hands, and feet were covered by envelopes of asbestos
cloth whose fibers were about a half millimeter in diameter.The bonnet
contained apertures for the eyes, nose, and ears, and consisted of a
single thickness of fabric, as did the stockings, but the gloves were of
double thickness, so that the wearer could seize burning objects with
the hands.Aldini, convinced of the services that his apparatus might render to
humanity, traveled over Europe and gave gratuitous representations with
it.The exercises generally took place in the following order: Aldini
began by first wrapping his finger in asbestos and then with a double
layer of wire gauze.He then held it for some instants in the flame of
a candle or alcohol lamp.One of his assistants afterward put on the
asbestos glove of which I have spoken, and, protecting the palm of his
hand with another piece of asbestos cloth, seized a piece of red-hot
iron from a furnace and slowly carried it to a distance of forty or
fifty meters, lighted some straw with it, and then carried it back to
the furnace.On other occasions, the experimenters, holding firebrands
in their hands, walked for five minutes over a large grating under which
fagots were burning.In order to show how the head, eyes, and lungs were protected by the
wire gauze apparatus, one of the experimenters put on the asbestos
bonnet, helmet, and cuirass, and fixed the shield in front of his
breast.Then, in a chafing dish placed on a level with his shoulder, a
great fire of shavings was lighted, and care was taken to keep it up.Into the midst of these flames the experimenter then plunged his head
and remained thus five or six minutes with his face turned toward them.In an exhibition given at Paris before a committee from the Academic
des Sciences, there were set up two parallel fences formed of straw,
connected by iron wire to light wicker work, and arranged so as to leave
between them a passage 3 feet wide by 30 long.The heat was so intense,
when the fences were set on fire, that no one could approach nearer than
20 or 25 feet; and the flames seemed to fill the whole space between
them, and rose to a height of 9 or 10 feet.Six men clad in the Aldini
suit went in, one behind the other, between the blazing fences, and
walked slowly backward and forward in the narrow passage, while the fire
was being fed with fresh combustibles from the exterior.One of these
men carried on his back, in an ozier basket covered with wire gauze, a
child eight years of age, who had on no other clothing than an asbestos
bonnet.This same man, having the child with him, entered on another
occasion a clear fire whose flames reached a height of 18 feet, and
whose intensity was such that it could not be looked at.He remained
therein so long that the spectators began to fear that he had succumbed;
but he finally came out safe and sound.One of the conclusions to be drawn from the facts just stated is that
man can breathe in the midst of flames.This marvelous property cannot
be attributed exclusively to the cooling of the air by its passage
through the gauze before reaching the lungs; it shows also a very great
resistance of our organs to the action of heat.The following, moreover,
are direct proofs of such resistance.In England, in their first
experiment, Messrs.Joseph Banks, Charles Blagden, and Dr.Solander
remained for ten minutes in a hot-house whose temperature was 211 deg.Fahr., and their bodies preserved therein very nearly the usual heat.On
breathing against a thermometer they caused the mercury to fall several
degrees.Each expiration, especially when it was somewhat strong,
produced in their nostrils an agreeable impression of coolness, and the
same impression was also produced on their fingers when breathed upon.When they touched themselves their skin seemed to be as cold as that of
a corpse; but contact with their watch chains caused them to experience
a sensation like that of a burn.A thermometer placed under the tongue
of one of the experimenters marked 98 deg.Fahr., which is the normal
temperature of the human species.Emboldened by these first results, Blagden entered a hot-house in which
the thermometer in certain parts reached 262 deg.He remained therein
eight minutes, walked about in all directions, and stopped in the
coolest part, which was at 240 deg.During all this time he
experienced no painful sensations; but, at the end of seven minutes, he
felt an oppression of the lungs that inquieted him and caused him to
leave the place.His pulse at that moment showed 144 beats to the
minute, that is to say, double what it usually did.To ascertain whether
there was any error in the indications of the thermometer, and to find
out what effect would take place on inert substances exposed to the hot
air that he had breathed, Blogden placed some eggs in a zinc plate in
the hot-house, alongside the thermometer, and found that in twenty
minutes they were baked hard.A case is reported where workmen entered a furnace for drying moulds, in
England, the temperature of which was 177 deg., and whose iron sole plate
was so hot that it carbonized their wooden shoes.In the immediate
vicinity of this furnace the temperature rose to 160 deg.Persons not of
the trade who approached anywhere near the furnace experienced pain in
the eyes, nose, and ears.A baker is cited in Angoumois, France, who spent ten minutes in a
furnace at 132 deg.C.

The resistance of the human organism to so high temperatures can be
attributed to several causes.First, it has been found that the quantity
of carbonic acid exhaled by the lungs, and consequently the chemical
phenomena of internal combustion that are a source of animal heat,
diminish in measure as the external temperature rises.Hence, a conflict
which has for result the retardation of the moment at which a living
being will tend, without obstacle, to take the temperature of the
surrounding medium.On another hand, it has been observed that man
resists heat so much the less in proportion as the air is saturated
with vapors.Berger, who supported for seven minutes a temperature
varying from 109 deg.C. in dry air, could remain only twelve
minutes in a bagnio whose temperature rose from 41 deg.At the
Hammam of Paris the highest temperature obtained is 87 deg., and Dr.E.
Martin has not been able to remain therein more than five minutes.This
physician reports that in 1743, the thermometer having exceeded 40 deg.at
Pekin, 14,000 persons perished.These facts are explained by the cooling
that the evaporation of perspiration produces on the surface of the
body.Edwards has calculated that such evaporation is ten times greater
in dry air in motion than in calm and humid air.The observations become
still more striking when the skin is put in contact with a liquid or a
solid which suppresses perspiration.Lemoine endured a bath of Bareges
water of 37 deg.for half an hour; but at 45 deg.he could not remain in it more
than seven minutes, and the perspiration began to flow at the end of six
minutes.According to Brewster, persons who experience no malaise near
a fire which communicates a temperature of 100 deg.C. to them, can hardly
bear contact with alcohol and oil at 55 deg.The facts adduced permit us to understand how it was possible to bear
one of the proofs to which it is said those were submitted who wished
to be initiated into the Egyptian mysteries.In a vast vaulted chamber
nearly a hundred feet long, there were erected two fences formed of
posts, around which were wound branches of Arabian balm, Egyptian thorn,
and tamarind--all very flexible and inflammable woods.When this was set
on fire the flames arose as far as the vault, licked it, and gave the
chamber the appearance of a hot furnace, the smoke escaping through
pipes made for the purpose.Then the door was suddenly opened before the
neophyte, and he was ordered to traverse this burning place, whose floor
was composed of an incandescent grating.The Abbe Terrason recounts all these details in his historic romance
"Sethos," printed at the end of last century.Unfortunately literary
frauds were in fashion then, and the book, published as a translation of
an old Greek manuscript, gives no indication of sources.I have sought
in special works for the data which the abbe must have had as a basis,
but I have not been able to find them.I suppose, however, that
this description, which is so precise, is not merely a work of the
imagination.The author goes so far as to give the dimensions of the
grating (30 feet by 8), and, greatly embarrassed to explain how his hero
was enabled to traverse it without being burned, is obliged to suppose
it to have been formed of very thick bars, between which Sethos had care
to place his feet.He who had the
courage to rush, head bowed, into the midst of the flames, certainly
would not have amused himself by choosing the place to put his feet.Braving the fire that surrounded his entire body, he must have had no
other thought than that of reaching the end of his dangerous voyage as
soon as possible.We cannot see very well, moreover, how this immense
grate, lying on the ground, was raised to a red heat and kept at such a
temperature.It is infinitely more simple to suppose that between the
two fences there was a ditch sufficiently deep in which a fire had
also been lighted, and which was covered by a grating as in the Aldini
experiments.It is even probable that this grating was of copper,
which, illuminated by the fireplace, must have presented a terrifying
brilliancy, while in reality it served only to prevent the flames from
the fireplace reaching him who dared to brave them.*       *       *       *       *




THE BUILDING STONE SUPPLY.The use of stone as a building material was not resorted to, except to
a trifling extent, in this country until long after the need of such a
solid substance was felt.The early settler contented himself with the
log cabin, the corduroy road, and the wooden bridge, and loose stone
enough for foundation purposes could readily be gathered from the
surface of the earth.Even after the desirability of more handsome and
durable building material for public edifices in the colonial cities
than wood became apparent, the ample resources which nature had afforded
in this country were overlooked, and brick and stone were imported by
the Dutch and English settlers from the Old World.Thus we find the
colonists of the New Netherlands putting yellow brick on their list
of non-dutiable imports in 1648; and such buildings in Boston as are
described as being "fairly set forth with brick, tile, slate, and
stone," were thus provided only with foreign products.Isolated
instances of quarrying stone are known to have occurred in the last
century; but they are rare.The edifice known as "King's Chapel,"
Boston, erected in 1752, is the first one on record as being built from
American stone; this was granite, brought from Braintree, Mass.Granite is a rock particularly abundant in New England, though also
found in lesser quantities elsewhere in this country.The first granite
quarries that were extensively developed were those at Quincy, Mass.,
and work began at that point early in the present century.The fame of
the stone became widespread, and it was sent to distant markets--even to
New Orleans.The old Merchants' Exchange in New York (afterward used as
a custom house) the Astor House in that city, and the Custom House in
New Orleans, all nearly or quite fifty years old, were constructed of
Quincy granite, as were many other fine buildings along the Atlantic
coast.In later years, not only isolated public edifices, but also whole
blocks of stores, have been constructed of this material.It was from
the Quincy quarries that the first railroad in this country was built;
this was a horse-railroad, three miles long, extending to Neponset
River, built in 1827.Other points in Massachusetts have been famed for their excellent
granite.After Maine was set off as a distinct State, Fox Island
acquired repute for its granite, and built up an extensive traffic
therein.Westerly, R.I., has also been engaged in quarrying this
valuable rock for many years, most of its choicer specimens having been
wrought for monumental purposes.Statues and other elaborate monumental
designs are now extensively made therefrom.Smaller pieces and a coarser
quality of the stone are here and elsewhere along the coast obtained in
large quantities for the construction of massive breakwaters to protect
harbors.Another point famous for its granite is Staten Island, New
York.This stone weighs 180 pounds to the cubic foot, while the Quincy
granite weighs but 165.The Staten Island product is used not only for
building purposes, but is also especially esteemed for paving after both
the Russ and Belgian patents.New York and other cities derive large
supplies from this source.The granite of Weehawken, N.J., is of the
same character, and greatly in demand.Port Deposit, Md., and Richmond,
Va, are also centers of granite production.Near Abbeville, S.C., and
in Georgia, granite is found quite like that of Quincy.Much southern
granite, however, decomposes readily, and is almost as soft as clay.This variety of stone is found in great abundance in the Rocky
Mountains; but, except to a slight extent in California, it is not yet
quarried there.Granite, having little grain, can be cut into blocks of almost any size
and shape.Specimens as much as eighty feet long have been taken out and
transported great distances.The quarrying is done by drilling a series
of small holes, six inches or more deep and almost the same distance
apart, inserting steel wedges along the whole line and then tapping each
gently with a hammer in succession, in order that the strain may be
evenly distributed.A building material that came into use earlier than granite is known as
freestone or sandstone; although its first employment does not date back
further than the erection of King's Chapel, Boston, already referred to
as the earliest well-known occasion where granite was used in building.Altogether the most famous American sandstone quarries are those at
Portland, on the Connecticut River, opposite Middletown.These were
worked before the Revolution; and their product has been shipped to many
distant points in the country.The long rows of "brownstone fronts" in
New York city are mostly of Portland stone, though in many cases the
walls are chiefly of brick covered with thin layers of the stone.The
old red sandstone of the Connecticut valley is distinguished in geology
for the discovery of gigantic fossil footprints of birds, first noticed
in the Portland quarries in 1802.Some of these footprints measured
ten to sixteen inches, and they were from four to six feet apart.The
sandstone of Belleville, N.J., has also extensive use and reputation.Trinity Church in New York city and the Boston Atheneum are built of the
product of these quarries; St.Lawrence County, New York, is noted also
for a fine bed of sandstone.At Potsdam it is exposed to a depth of
seventy feet.There are places though, in New England, New York, and
Eastern Pennsylvania, where a depth of three hundred feet has been
reached.The Potsdam sandstone is often split to the thinness of an
inch.It hardens by exposure, and is often used for smelting furnace
hearth-stones.Shawangunk Mountain, in Ulster County, yields a sandstone
of inferior quality, which has been unsuccessfully tried for paving;
as it wears very unevenly.From Ulster, Greene, and Albany Counties
sandstone slabs for sidewalks are extensively quarried for city use;
the principal outlets of these sections being Kingston, Saugerties,
Coxsackie, Bristol, and New Baltimore, on the Hudson.In this region
quantities amounting to millions of square feet are taken out in large
sheets, which are often sawed into the sizes desired.The vicinity of
Medina, in Western New York, yields a sandstone extensively used in that
section for paving and curbing, and a little for building.A rather poor
quality of this stone has been found along the Potomac, and some of it
was used in the erection of the old Capitol building at Washington.Ohio yields a sandstone that is of a light gray color; Berea, Amherst,
Vermilion, and Massillon are the chief points of production.Genevieve, Mo., yields a stone of fine grain of a light straw color,
which is quite equal to the famous Caen stone of France.The Lake
Superior sandstones are dark and coarse grained, but strong.In some parts of the country, where neither granite nor sandstone
is easily procured, blue and gray limestone are sometimes used for
building, and, when hammer dressed, often look like granite.A serious
objection to their use, however, is the occasional presence of iron,
which rusts on exposure, and defaces the building.In Western New York
they are widely used.Topeka stone, like the coquine of Florida and
Bermuda, is soft like wood when first quarried, and easily wrought,
but it hardens on exposure.The limestones of Canton, Mo., Joliet and
Athens, Ill., Dayton, Sandusky, Marblehead, and other points in Ohio,
Ellittsville, Ind., and Louisville and Bowling Green, Ky., are great
favorites west.In many of these regions limestone is extensively used
for macadamizing roads, for which it is excellently adapted.It also
yields excellent slabs or flags for sidewalks.One of the principal uses of this variety of stone is its conversion, by
burning, into lime for building purposes.All limestones are by no
means equally excellent in this regard.Thomaston lime, burned with
Pennsylvania coal, near the Penobscot River, has had a wide reputation
for nearly half a century.It has been shipped thence to all points
along the Atlantic coast, invading Virginia as far as Lynchburg, and
going even to New Orleans, Smithfield, R.I., and Westchester County,
N.Y., near the lower end of the Highlands, also make a particularly
excellent quality of lime.Kingston, in Ulster County, makes an inferior
sort for agricultural purposes.The Ohio and other western stones yield
a poor lime, and that section is almost entirely dependent on the east
for supplies.Marbles, like limestones, with which they are closely related, are very
abundant in this country, and are also to be found in a great variety of
colors.As early as 1804 American marble was used for statuary purposes.Early in the century it also obtained extensive employment for
gravestones.Its use for building purposes has been more recent than
granite and sandstone in this country; and it is coming to supersede the
latter to a great degree.For mantels, fire-places, porch pillars, and
like ornamental purposes, however, our variegated, rich colored and
veined or brecciated marbles were in use some time before exterior walls
were made from them.Among the earliest marble buildings were Girard
College in Philadelphia and the old City Hall in New York, and the
Custom House in the latter city, afterward used for a sub-treasury.The
new Capitol building at Washington is among the more recent structures
composed of this material.Our exports of marble to Cuba and elsewhere
amount to over $300,000 annually, although we import nearly the same
amount from Italy.And yet an article can be found in the United States
fully as fine as the famous Carrara marble.We refer to that which comes
from Rutland, Vt.This state yields the largest variety and choicest
specimens.The marble belt runs both ways from Rutland County, where
the only quality fit for statuary is obtained.Toward the north it
deteriorates by growing less sound, though finer in grain; while to
the south it becomes coarser.A beautiful black marble is obtained at
Shoreham, Vt.There are also handsome brecciated marbles in the same
state; and in the extreme northern part, near Lake Champlain, they
become more variegated and rich in hue.Such other marble as is found
in New England is of an inferior quality.The pillars of Girard
College came from Berkshire, Mass., which ranks next after Vermont in
reputation.The marble belt extends from New England through New York, Pennsylvania,
Maryland, the District of Columbia, and Virginia, Tennessee, and the
Carolinas, to Georgia and Alabama.Some of the variegated and high
colored varieties obtained near Knoxville, Tenn., nearly equal that of
Vermont.The Rocky Mountains contain a vast abundance and variety.Slate was known to exist in this country to a slight extent in colonial
days.It was then used for gravestones, and to some extent for roofing
and school purposes.It is
stated that a slate quarry was operated in Northampton County, Pa., as
early as 1805.In 1826 James M. Porter and Samuel Taylor engaged in the
business, obtaining their supplies from the Kittanninny Mountains.From
this time the business developed rapidly, the village of Slateford being
an outgrowth of it, and large rafts being employed to float the product
down the Schuylkill to Philadelphia.By 1860 the industry had reached
the capacity of 20,000 cases of slate, valued at $10 a case, annually.In 1839 quarries were opened in the Piscataquis River, forty miles
north of Bangor, Me., but poor transportation facilities retarded the
business.Vermont began to yield in 1852.New York's quarries are
confined to Washington County, near the Vermont line.Maryland has
a limited supply from Harford County.The Huron Mountains, north of
Marquette, Mich., contain slate, which is also said to exist in Pike
County, Ga.Grindstones, millstones, and whetstones are quarried in New York, Ohio,
Michigan, Pennsylvania, and other States.Mica is found at Acworth and
Grafton, N. H., and near Salt Lake, but our chief supply comes from
Haywood, Yancey, Mitchell, and Macon counties, in North Carolina, and
our product is so large that we can afford to export it.Other stones,
such as silex, for making glass, etc., are found in profusion in various
parts of the country, but we have no space to enter into a detailed
account of them at present.--_Pottery and Glassware Reporter_.*       *       *       *       *




AN INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.The most interesting change of which the Census gives account is the
increase in the number of farms.The number has virtually doubled within
twenty years.The population of the country has not increased in like
proportion.A large part of the increase in number of farms has been due
to the division of great estates.Nor has this occurred, as some may
imagine, exclusively in the Southern States and the States to which
immigration and migration have recently been directed.It is an
important fact that the multiplication of farms has continued even in
the older Northern States, though the change has not been as great in
these as in States of the far West or the South.In New York there has
been an increase of 25,000, or 11.5 per cent, in the number of farms
since 1870; in New Jersey the increase has been 12.2 per cent., and in
Pennsylvania 22.7 per cent., though the increase in population, and
doubtless in the number of persons engaged in farming, has been much
smaller.Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois also, have been considered fully
settled States for years, at least in an agricultural point of view, and
yet the number of farms has increased 26.1 per cent, in ten years in
Ohio, 20.3 percent, in Indiana, and 26.1 per cent, in Illinois.The
obvious explanation is that the growth of many cities and towns has
created a market for a far greater supply of those products which may be
most advantageously grown upon farms of moderate size; but even if this
fully accounts for the phenomenon, the change must be recognized as one
of the highest importance industrially, socially, and politically.The
man who owns or rents and cultivates a farm stands on a very different
footing from the laborer who works for wages.It is not a small matter
that, in these six States alone, there are 205,000 more owners or
managers of farms than there were only a decade ago.As we go further toward the border, west or north, the influence of the
settlement of new land is more distinctly felt.Even in Michigan, where
new railroads have opened new regions to settlement, the increase in
number of farms has been over 55 per cent.In Wisconsin, though the
increase in railroad mileage has been about the same as in Michigan, the
reported increase in number of farms has been only 28 per cent., but in
Iowa it rises to 60 per cent., and in Minnesota to nearly 100 per cent.In Kansas the number of farms is 138,561, against 38,202 in 1870; in
Nebraska 63,387, against 12,301; and in Dakota 17,435, against 1,720.In
these regions the process is one of creation of new States rather than a
change in the social and industrial condition of the population.Some Southern States have gained largely, but the increase in these,
though very great, is less surprising than the new States of the
Northwest.The prevailing tendency of Southern agriculture to large
farms and the employment of many hands is especially felt in States
where land is still abundant.The greatest increase is in Texas, where
174,184 farms are reported, against 61,125 in 1870; in Florida, with
23,438 farms, against 10,241 in 1870; and in Arkansas, with 94,433
farms, against 49,424 in 1870.In Missouri 215,575 farms are reported,
against 148,228 in 1870.In these States, though social changes have
been great, the increase in number of farms has been largely due to new
settlements, as in the States of the far Northwest.But the change in
the older Southern States is of a different character.Virginia, for example, has long been settled, and had 77,000 farms
thirty years ago.But the increase in number within the past ten years
has been 44,668, or 60.5 per cent.Contrasting this with the increase in
New York, a remarkable difference appears.West Virginia had few more
farms ten years ago than New Jersey; now it has nearly twice as many,
and has gained in number nearly 60 per cent.North Carolina, too, has
increased 78 per cent.in number of farms since 1870, and South Carolina
80 per cent.In Georgia the increase has been still greater--from 69,956
to 138,626, or nearly 100 per cent.In Alabama there are 135,864
farms, against 67,382 in 1870, an increase of over 100 per cent.These
proportions, contrasted with those for the older Northern States, reveal
a change that is nothing less than an industrial revolution.But the
force of this tendency to division of estates has been greatest in the
States named.Whereas the ratio of increase in number of farms becomes
greater in Northern States as we go from the East toward the Mississippi
River, at the South it is much smaller in Kentucky, Tennessee,
Mississippi, and Louisiana than in the older States on the Atlantic
coast.Thus in Louisiana the increase has been from 28,481 to 48,292
farms, or 70 per cent., and in Mississippi from 68,023 to 101,772 farms,
or less than 50 per cent., against 100 in Alabama and Georgia.In
Kentucky the increase has been from 118,422 to 166,453 farms, or 40 per
cent., and in Tennessee from 118,141 to 165,650 farms, or 40 per cent.,
against 60 in Virginia and West Virginia, and 78 in North Carolina.Thus, while the tendency to division is far greater than in the Northern
States of corresponding age, it is found in full force only in six of
the older Southern States, Alabama, West Virginia, and four on the
Atlantic coast.In these, the revolution already effected foreshadows
and will almost certainly bring about important political changes within
a few years.In these six States there 310,795 more farm owners or
occupants than there were ten years ago.--_N.Y.*       *       *       *       *




A FARMER'S LIME KILN.For information about burning lime we republish the following article
furnished by a correspondent of the _Country Gentleman_ several years
ago:

[Illustration: Fig.1), Railway Track--B B B,
Iron Rods running through Kiln--C, Capstone over Arch--D, Arch--E, Well
without brick or ash lining.]I send you a description and sketch of a lime-kiln put up on my premises
about five years ago.The dimensions of this kiln are 13 feet square by
25 feet high from foundation, and its capacity 100 bushels in 24 hours.It was constructed of the limestone quarried on the spot.It has round
iron rods (shown in sketch) passing through, with iron plates fastened
to the ends as clamps to make it more firm; the pair nearest the top
should be not less than 2 feet from that point, the others interspersed
about 2 feet apart--the greatest strain being near the top.The arch
should be 7 feet high by 51/2 wide in front, with a gather on the top
and sides of about 1 foot, with plank floor; and if this has a little
incline it will facilitate shoveling the lime when drawn.The arch
should have a strong capstone; also one immediately under the well of
the kiln, with a hole 2 feet in diameter to draw the lime through; or
two may be used with semicircle cut in each.Iron bars 2 inches wide by
1/8 inch thick are used in this kiln for closing it, working in slots
fastened to capstone.These slots must be put in before the caps
are laid.When it is desired to draw lime, these bars may be
pushed laterally in the slots, or drawn out entirely, according to
circumstances; 3 bars will be enough.The slots are made of iron bars
11/2 inches wide, with ends rounded and turned up, and inserted in holes
drilled through capstone and keyed above.The well of the kiln is lined with fire-brick one course thick, with a
stratum of coal ashes three inches thick tamped in between the brick
and wall, which proves a great protection to the wall.About 2,000
fire-bricks were used.The proprietors of this kiln say about one-half
the lower part of the well might have been lined with a first quality of
common brick and saved some expense and been just as good.The form of
the well shown in Fig.3 is 7 feet in diameter in the bilge, exclusive
of the lining of brick and ashes.Experiments in this vicinity have
proved this to be the best, this contraction toward the top being
absolutely necessary, the expansion of the stone by the heat is so
great that the lime cannot be drawn from perpendicular walls, as was
demonstrated in one instance near here, where a kiln was built on that
principle.The kiln, of course, is for coal, and our stone requires
about three-quarters of a ton per 100 bushels of lime, but this, I am
told, varies according to quality, some requiring more than others; the
quantity can best be determined by experimenting; also the regulation of
the heat--if too great it will cause the stones to melt or run together
as it were, or, if too little, they will not be properly burned.The
business requires skill and judgment to run it successfully.This kiln is located at the foot of a steep bluff, the top about level
with the top of the kiln, with railway track built of wooden sleepers,
with light iron bars, running from the bluff to the top of the kiln, and
a hand-car makes it very convenient filling the kiln.Such a location
should be had if possible.Your inquirer may perhaps get some ideas
of the principles of a kiln for using _coal_.The dimensions may be
reduced, if desired.If for _wood_, the arch would have to be formed for
that, and the height of kiln reduced.*       *       *       *       *




THE MANUFACTURE OF APPLE JELLY.[Footnote: From the report of the New York Agricultural Society.]Within the county of Oswego, New York, Dewitt C. Peck reports there are
five apple jelly factories in operation.The failure of the apple crop,
for some singular and unexplained reason, does not extend in great
degree to the natural or ungrafted fruit.Though not so many as common,
even of these apples, there are yet enough to keep these five mills and
the numerous cider mills pretty well employed.The largest jelly factory
is located near the village of Mexico, and as there are some features in
regard to this manufacture peculiar to this establishment which may be
new and interesting, we will undertake a brief description.The factory
is located on the Salmon Creek, which affords the necessary power.A
portion of the main floor, first story, is occupied as a saw mill,
the slabs furnishing fuel for the boiler furnace connected with the
evaporating department.Just above the mill, along the bank of the pond,
and with one end projecting over the water, are arranged eight large
bins, holding from five hundred to one thousand bushels each, into which
the apples are delivered from the teams.The floor in each of these has
a sharp pitch or inclination toward the water and at the lower end is a
grate through which the fruit is discharged, when wanted, into a trough
half submerged in the pond.The preparation of the fruit and extraction of the juice proceeds
as follows: Upon hoisting a gate in the lower end of this trough,
considerable current is caused, and the water carries the fruit a
distance of from thirty to one hundred feet, and passes into the
basement of the mill, where, tumbling down a four-foot perpendicular
fall, into a tank, tight in its lower half and slatted so as to permit
the escape of water and impurities in the upper half, the apples are
thoroughly cleansed from all earthy or extraneous matter.Such is the
friction caused by the concussion of the fall, the rolling and rubbing
of the apples together, and the pouring of the water, that decayed
sections of the fruit are ground off and the rotten pulp passes away
with other impurities.From this tank the apples are hoisted upon an
endless chain elevator, with buckets in the form of a rake-head with
iron teeth, permitting drainage and escape of water, to an upper story
of the mill, whence by gravity they descend to the grater.The press
is wholly of iron, all its motions, even to the turning of the screws,
being actuated by the water power.The cheese is built up with layers
inclosed in strong cotton cloth, which displaces the straw used in olden
time, and serves also to strain the cider.As it is expressed from
the press tank, the cider passes to a storage tank, and thence to the
defecator.This defecator is a copper pan, eleven feet long and about three feet
wide.At each end of this pan is placed a copper tube three inches in
diameter and closed at both ends.Lying between and connecting
these two, are twelve tubes, also of copper, 11/2 inches in diameter,
penetrating the larger tubes at equal distances from their upper and
under surfaces, the smaller being parallel with each other, and 11/2
inches apart.When placed in position, the larger tubes, which act as
manifolds, supplying the smaller with steam, rest upon the bottom of the
pan, and thus the smaller pipes have a space of three-fourths of an inch
underneath their outer surfaces.The cider comes from the storage tank in a continuous stream about
three-eighths of an inch in diameter.Steam is introduced to the large
or manifold tubes, and from them distributed through the smaller ones at
a pressure of from twenty-five to thirty pounds per inch.Trap valves
are provided for the escape of water formed by condensation within the
pipes.The primary object of the defecator is to remove all impurities
and perfectly clarify the liquid passing through it.All portions of
pomace and other minute particles of foreign matter, when heated,
expand and float in the form of scum upon the surface of the cider.An
ingeniously contrived floating rake drags off this scum and delivers it
over the side of the pan.To facilitate this removal, one side of the
pan, commencing at a point just below the surface of the cider, is
curved gently outward and upward, terminating in a slightly inclined
plane, over the edge of which the scum is pushed by the rake into a
trough and carried away.A secondary purpose served by the defecator
is that of reducing the cider by evaporation to a partial sirup of the
specific gravity of about 20 deg.When of this consistency the liquid
is drawn from the bottom and less agitated portion of the defecator by a
siphon, and thence carried to the evaporator, which is located upon the
same framework and just below the defecator.The evaporator consists of a separate system of six copper tubes, each
twelve feet long and three inches in diameter.These are each jacketed
or inclosed in an iron pipe of four inches internal diameter, fitted
with steam-tight collars so as to leave half an inch steam space
surrounding the copper tubes.The latter are open at both ends
permitting the admission and egress of the sirup and the escape of the
steam caused by evaporation therefrom, and are arranged upon the frame
so as to have a very slight inclination downward in the direction of
the current, and each nearly underneath its predecessor in regular
succession.Each is connected by an iron supply pipe, having a steam
gauge or indicator attached, with a large manifold, and that by other
pipes with a steam boiler of thirty horse power capacity.Steam being
let on at from twenty five to thirty pounds pressure, the stream of
sirup is received from the defecator through a strainer, which removes
any impurities possibly remaining into the upper evaporator tube;
passing in a gentle flow through that, it is delivered into a funnel
connected with the next tube below, and so, back and forth, through the
whole system.The sirup enters the evaporator at a consistency of from
20 deg.Baume, and emerges from the last tube some three minutes
later at a consistency of from 30 deg.Baume, which is found on
cooling to be the proper point for perfect jelly.This point is found to
vary one or two degrees, according to the fermentation consequent upon
bruises in handling the fruit, decay of the same, or any little delay in
expressing the juice from the cheese.The least fermentation occasions
the necessity for a lower reduction.To guard against this, no cheese
is allowed to stand over night, no pomace left in the grater or vat, no
cider in the tank; and further to provide against fermentation, a large
water tank is located upon the roof and filled by a force pump, and by
means of hose connected with this, each grater, press, vat, tank, pipe,
trough, or other article of machinery used, can be thoroughly washed and
cleansed.Hot water, instead of cider, is sometimes sent through the
defecator, evaporator, etc., until all are thoroughly scalded and
purified.If the saccharometer shows too great or too little reduction,
the matter is easily regulated by varying the steam pressure in the
evaporator by means of a valve in the supply pipe.If boiled cider
instead of jelly is wanted for making pies, sauces, etc., it is drawn
off from one of the upper evaporator tubes according to the consistency
desired; or can be produced at the end of the process by simply reducing
the steam pressure.As the jelly emerges from the evaporator it is transferred to a tub
holding some fifty gallons, and by mixing a little therein, any little
variations in reduction or in the sweetness or sourness of the fruit
used are equalized.From this it is drawn through faucets, while hot,
into the various packages in which it is shipped to market.A favorite
form of package for family use is a nicely turned little wooden
bucket with cover and bail, two sizes, holding five and ten pounds
respectively.The smaller packages are shipped in cases for convenience
in handling.The present product of this manufactory is from 1,500 to
1,800 pounds of jelly each day of ten hours.It is calculated that
improvements now in progress will increase this to something more than a
ton per day.Each bushel of fruit will produce from four to five pounds
of jelly, fruit ripening late in the season being more productive than
earlier varieties.Crab apples produce the finest jelly; sour, crabbed,
natural fruit makes the best looking article, and a mixture of all
varieties gives most satisfactory results as to flavor and general
quality.As the pomace is shoveled from the finished cheese, it is again ground
under a toothed cylinder, and thence drops into large troughs, through a
succession of which a considerable stream of water is flowing.Here it
is occasionally agitated by raking from the lower to the upper end of
the trough as the current carries it downward, and the apple seeds
becoming disengaged drop to the bottom into still water, while the pulp
floats away upon the stream.A succession of troughs serves to remove
nearly all the seeds.The value of the apple seeds thus saved is
sufficient to pay the daily wages of all the hands employed in the whole
establishment.The apples are measured in the wagon box, one and a half
cubic feet being accounted a bushel.This mill ordinarily employs about six men: One general superintendent,
who buys and measures the apples, keeps time books, attends to all the
accounts and the working details of the mill, and acts as cashier; one
sawyer, who manufactures lumber for the local market and saws the slabs
into short lengths suitable for the furnace; one cider maker, who grinds
the apples and attends the presses; one jelly maker, who attends the
defecator, evaporator, and mixing tub, besides acting as his own fireman
and engineer; one who attends the apple seed troughs and acts as general
helper, and one man-of-all-work to pack, ship and assist whenever
needed.The establishment was erected late in the season of 1880,
and manufactured that year about forty-five tons of jelly, besides
considerable cider exchanged to the farmers for apples, and some boiled
cider.The price paid for apples in 1880, when the crop was superabundant, was
six to eight cents per bushel; in 1881, fifteen cents.The proprietor
hopes next year to consume 100,000 bushels.These institutions are
important to the farmer in that they use much fruit not otherwise
valuable and very perishable.Fruit so crabbed and gnarled as to have no
market value, and even frozen apples, if delivered while yet solid, can
be used.(Such apples are placed in the water while frozen, the water
draws the frost sufficiently to be grated, and passing through the press
and evaporator before there is time for chemical change, they are found
to make very good jelly.They are valuable to the consumer by converting
the perishable, cheap, almost worthless crop of the bearing and abundant
years into such enduring form that its consumption may be carried over
to years of scarcity and furnish healthful food in cheap and pleasant
form to many who would otherwise be deprived; and lastly, they are of
great interest to society, in that they give to cider twice the value
for purposes of food that it has or can have, even to the manufacturer,
for use as a beverage and intoxicant.*       *       *       *       *




IMPROVED GRAPE BAGS.It stands to reason that were our summers warmer we should be able to
grow grapes successfully on open walls; it is therefore probable that
a new grape bag, the invention of M. Pelletier, 20 Rue de la Banque,
Paris, intended to serve a double purpose, viz., protecting the fruit
and hastening its maturity, will, when it becomes known, be welcomed in
this country.It consists of a square of curved glass so fixed to
the bag that the sun's rays are concentrated upon the fruit, thereby
rendering its ripening more certain in addition to improving its quality
generally.The glass is affixed to the bag by means of a light iron wire
support.It covers that portion of it next the sun, so that it increases
the amount of light and warms the grapes without scorching them, a
result due to the convexity of the glass and the layer of air between it
and the bag.M. Pelletier had the idea of rendering these bags cheaper
by employing plain squares instead of curved ones, but the advantage
thus obtained was more than counterbalanced by their comparative
inefficacy.In practice it was found that the curved squares gave an
average of 7 deg.more than the straight ones, while there was a difference
of 10 deg.when the bags alone were used, thus plainly demonstrating the
practical value of the invention.Whether these glass-fronted bags would have much value in the case of
grapes grown under glass in the ordinary way is a question that can only
be determined by actual experiment; but where the vines are on walls,
either under glass screens or in the open air, so that the bunches feel
the full force of the sun's rays, there can be no doubt as to their
utility, and it is probable that by their aid many of the continental
varieties which we do not now attempt to grow in the open, and which are
scarcely worthy of a place under glass, might be well ripened.At
any rate we ought to give anything a fair trial which may serve to
neutralize, if only in a slight degree, the uncertainty of our summers.As it is, we have only about two varieties of grapes, and these not the
best of the hardy kinds, as regards flavor and appearance, that ripen
out of doors, and even these do not always succeed.We know next to
nothing of the many really well-flavored kinds which are so much
appreciated in many parts of the Continent.The fact is, our outdoor
culture of grapes offers a striking contrast to that practiced under
glass, and although our comparatively sunless and moist climate affords
some excuse for our shortcomings in this respect, there is no valid
reason for the utter want of good culture which is to be observed in a
general way.[Illustration: GRAPE BAG.--OPEN.]Given intelligent training, constant care in stopping the laterals, and
checking mildew as well as thinning the berries, allowing each bunch to
get the full benefit of sun and air, and I believe good eatable grapes
would often be obtained even in summers marked by a low average
temperature.[Illustration: GRAPE BAG.--CLOSED.]If, moreover, to a good system of culture we add some such mechanical
contrivance as that under notice whereby the bunches enjoy an average
warmth some 10 deg.higher than they otherwise would do, we not only insure
the grapes coming to perfection in favored districts, but outdoor
culture might probably be practiced in higher latitudes than is now
practicable.[Illustration: CURVED GLASS FOR FRONT OF BAG.]The improved grape bag would also offer great facilities for destroying
mildew or guarantee the grapes against its attacks, as a light dusting
administered as soon as the berries were fairly formed would suffice for
the season, as owing to the glass protecting the berries from driving
rains, which often accompany south or south-west winds in summer and
autumn, the sulphur would not be washed off.[Illustration: CURVED GLASS FIXED ON BAG.]The inventor claims, and we should say with just reason, that these
glass fronted bags would be found equally serviceable for the ripening
of pears and other choice fruits, and with a view to their being
employed for such a purpose, he has had them made of varying sizes and
shapes.In conclusion, it may be observed that, in addition to advancing
the maturity of the fruits to which they are applied, they also serve to
preserve them from falling to the ground when ripe.--J.COBNHILL, _in
the Garden_.*       *       *       *       *




UTILIZATION OF SOLAR HEAT.At a popular fete in the Tuileries Gardens I was struck with an
experiment which seems deserving of the immediate attention of the
English public and military authorities.Among the attractions of the fete was an apparatus for the concentration
and utilization of solar heat, and, though the sun was not very
brilliant, I saw this apparatus set in motion a printing machine which
printed several thousand copies of a specimen newspaper entitled the
_Soleil Journal_.The sun's rays are concentrated in a reflector, which moves at the
same rate as the sun and heats a vertical boiler, setting the motive
steam-engine at work.As may be supposed, the only object was to
demonstrate the possibility of utilizing the concentrated heat of the
solar rays; but I closely examined it, because the apparatus seems
capable of great utility in existing circumstances.Here in France,
indeed, there is a radical drawback--the sun is often overclouded.Thousands of years ago the idea of utilizing the solar rays must have
suggested itself, and there are still savage tribes who know no other
mode of combustion; but the scientific application has hitherto been
lacking.About fifteen years ago
Professor Mouchon, of Tours, began constructing such an apparatus, and
his experiments have been continued by M. Pifre, who has devoted much
labor and expense to realizing M. Mouchou's idea.A company has now come
to his aid, and has constructed a number of apparatus of different sizes
at a factory which might speedily turn out a large number of them.It is
evident that in a country of uninterrupted sunshine the boiler might be
heated in thirty or forty minutes.A portable apparatus could boil two
and one-half quarts an hour, or, say, four gallons a day, thus supplying
by distillation or ebullition six or eight men.The apparatus can be
easily carried on a man's back, and on condition of water, even of the
worst quality, being obtainable, good drinking and cooking water is
insured.M. De Rougaumond, a young scientific writer, has just published
an interesting volume on the invention.I was able yesterday to verify
his statements, for I saw cider made, a pump set in motion, and coffee
made--in short, the calorific action of the sun superseding that of
fuel.The apparatus, no doubt, has not yet reached perfection, but as it
is it would enable the soldier in India or Egypt to procure in the field
good water and to cook his food rapidly.The invention is of especial
importance to England just now, but even when the Egyptian question is
settled the Indian troops might find it of inestimable value.Red tape should for once be disregarded, and a competent commission
forthwith sent to 30 Rue d'Assas, with instructions to report
immediately, for every minute saved may avoid suffering for Englishmen
fighting abroad for their country.I may, of course, be mistaken, but
a commission would decide, and if the apparatus is good the slightest
delay in its adoption would be deplorable.--_Paris Correspondence London

HOW TO ESTABLISH A TRUE MERIDIAN.[Footnote: A paper read before the Engineers' Club of Philadelphia.]By PROFESSOR L. M. HAUPT.The discovery of the magnetic needle was a boon to mankind, and has been
of inestimable service in guiding the mariner through trackless waters,
and the explorer over desert wastes.In these, its legitimate uses, the
needle has not a rival, but all efforts to apply it to the accurate
determination of permanent boundary lines have proven very
unsatisfactory, and have given rise to much litigation, acerbity, and
even death.For these and other cogent reasons, strenuous efforts are being made to
dispense, so far as practicable, with the use of the magnetic needle
in surveying, and to substitute therefor the more accurate method of
traversing from a true meridian.This method, however, involves a
greater degree of preparation and higher qualifications than are
generally possessed, and unless the matter can be so simplified as to be
readily understood, it is unreasonable to expect its general application
in practice.Much has been written upon the various methods of determining, the
true meridian, but it is so intimately related to the determination of
latitude and time, and these latter in turn upon the fixing of a true
meridian, that the novice can find neither beginning nor end.When to
these difficulties are added the corrections for parallax, refraction,
instrumental errors, personal equation, and the determination of the
probable error, he is hopelessly confused, and when he learns that time
may be sidereal, mean solar, local, Greenwich, or Washington, and he is
referred to an ephemeris and table of logarithms for data, he becomes
lost in "confusion worse confounded," and gives up in despair, settling
down to the conviction that the simple method of compass surveying is
the best after all, even if not the most accurate.Having received numerous requests for information upon the subject, I
have thought it expedient to endeavor to prepare a description of the
method of determining the true meridian which should be sufficiently
clear and practical to be generally understood by those desiring to make
use of such information.This will involve an elementary treatment of the subject, beginning with
the


DEFINITIONS.The _celestial sphere_ is that imaginary surface upon which all
celestial objects are projected.The _earth's axis_ is the imaginary line about which it revolves.The _poles_ are the points in which the axis pierces the surface of the
earth, or of the celestial sphere.A _meridian_ is a great circle of the earth cut out by a plane passing
through the axis.All meridians are therefore north and south lines
passing through the poles.From these definitions it follows that if there were a star exactly at
the pole it would only be necessary to set up an instrument and take a
bearing to it for the meridian.Such not being the case, however, we are
obliged to take some one of the near circumpolar stars as our object,
and correct the observation according to its angular distance from the
meridian at the time of observation.For convenience, the bright star known as Ursae Minoris or Polaris, is
generally selected.This star apparently revolves about the north pole,
in an orbit whose mean radius is 1 deg.19' 13",[1] making the revolution in
23 hours 56 minutes.[Footnote 1: This is the codeclination as given in the Nautical Almanac.The mean value decreases by about 20 seconds each year.]During this time it must therefore cross the meridian twice, once above
the pole and once below; the former is called the _upper_, and the
latter the _lower meridian transit or culmination_.It must also pass
through the points farthest east and west from the meridian.The former
is called the _eastern elongation_, the latter the _western_.An observation may he made upon Polaris at any of these four points,
or at any other point of its orbit, but this latter case becomes too
complicated for ordinary practice, and is therefore not considered.If the observation were made upon the star at the time of its upper or
lower culmination, it would give the true meridian at once, but this
involves a knowledge of the true local time of transit, or the longitude
of the place of observation, which is generally an unknown quantity; and
moreover, as the star is then moving east or west, or at right angles to
the place of the meridian, at the rate of 15 deg.of arc in about one hour,
an error of so slight a quantity as only four seconds of time would
introduce an error of one minute of arc.If the observation be made,
however, upon either elongation, when the star is moving up or down,
that is, in the direction of the vertical wire of the instrument, the
error of observation in the angle between it and the pole will be
inappreciable.This is, therefore, the best position upon which to make
the observation, as the precise time of the elongation need not be
given.It can be determined with sufficient accuracy by a glance at the
relative positions of the star Alioth, in the handle of the Dipper,
and Polaris (see Fig.When the line joining these two stars is
horizontal or nearly so, and Alioth is to the _west_ of Polaris, the
latter is at its _eastern_ elongation, and _vice versa_, thus:

[Illustration]

But since the star at either elongation is off the meridian, it will
be necessary to determine the angle at the place of observation to be
turned off on the instrument to bring it into the meridian.This angle,
called the azimuth of the pole star, varies with the latitude of the
observer, as will appear from Fig 2, and hence its value must be
computed for different latitudes, and the surveyor must know his
_latitude_ before he can apply it.Let N be the north pole of the
celestial sphere; S, the position of Polaris at its eastern elongation;
then N S=1 deg.The azimuth of Polaris at the
latitude 40 deg.north is represented by the angle N O S, and that at 60 deg.north, by the angle N O' S, which is greater, being an exterior angle
of the triangle, O S O. From this we see that the azimuth varies at the
latitude.We have first, then, to _find the latitude of the place of observation_.Of the several methods for doing this, we shall select the simplest,
preceding it by a few definitions.A _normal_ line is the one joining the point directly overhead, called
the _zenith_, with the one under foot called the _nadir_.The _celestial horizon_ is the intersection of the celestial sphere by a
plane passing through the center of the earth and perpendicular to the
normal.A _vertical circle_ is one whose plane is perpendicular to the horizon,
hence all such circles must pass through the normal and have the zenith
and nadir points for their poles.The _altitude_ of a celestial object
is its distance above the horizon measured on the arc of a vertical
circle.As the distance from the horizon to the zenith is 90 deg., the
difference, or _complement_ of the altitude, is called the _zenith
distance_, or _co-altitude_.The _azimuth_ of an object is the angle between the vertical plane
through the object and the plane of the meridian, measured on the
horizon, and usually read from the south point, as 0 deg., through west, at
90, north 180 deg., etc., closing on south at 0 deg.These two co-ordinates, the altitude and azimuth, will determine the
position of any object with reference to the observer's place.The
latter's position is usually given by his latitude and longitude
referred to the equator and some standard meridian as co-ordinates.The _latitude_ being the angular distance north or south of the equator,
and the _longitude_ east or west of the assumed meridian.We are now prepared to prove that _the altitude of the pole is equal to
the latitude of the place of observation_.Let H P Z Q1, etc., Fig.2, represent a meridian section of the sphere,
in which P is the north pole and Z the place of observation, then H H1
will be the horizon, Q Q1 the equator, H P will be the altitude of P,
and Q1 Z the latitude of Z. These two arcs are equal, for H C Z = P C
Q1 = 90 deg., and if from these equal quadrants the common angle P C Z be
subtracted, the remainders H C P and Z C Q1, will be equal.To _determine the altitude of the pole_, or, in other words, _the
latitude of the place_.Observe the altitude of the pole star _when on the meridian_, either
above or below the pole, and from this observed altitude corrected for
refraction, subtract the distance of the star from the pole, or its
_polar distance_, if it was an upper transit, or add it if a lower.The result will be the required latitude with sufficient accuracy for
ordinary purposes.The time of the star's being on the meridian can be determined with
sufficient accuracy by a mere inspection of the heavens.The refraction
is _always negative_, and may be taken from the table appended by
looking up the amount set opposite the observed altitude.Thus, if the
observer's altitude should be 40 deg.39' the nearest refraction 01' 07",
should be subtracted from 40 deg.37' 53" for the
latitude.TO FIND THE AZIMUTH OF POLARIS.As we have shown the azimuth of Polaris to be a function of the
latitude, and as the latitude is now known, we may proceed to find the
required azimuth.For this purpose we have a right-angled spherical
triangle, Z S P, Fig.4, in which Z is the place of observation, P the
north pole, and S is Polaris.In this triangle we have given the polar
distance, P S = 10 deg.19' 13"; the angle at S = 90 deg.; and the distance Z
P, being the complement of the latitude as found above, or 90 deg.--L.Substituting these in the formula for the azimuth, we will have sin.of co-latitude, from
which, by assuming different values for the co-latitude, we compute the
following table:

An analysis of this table shows that the azimuth this year (1882)
increases with the latitude from 1 deg.It also shows that the azimuth of Polaris at
any one point of observation decreases slightly from year to year.This
is due to the increase in declination, or decrease in the star's polar
distance.north latitude, this annual decrease in the azimuth
is about 22", while at 50 deg.As the variation in
azimuth for each degree of latitude is small, the table is only computed
for the even numbered degrees; the intermediate values being readily
obtained by interpolation.We see also that an error of a few minutes of
latitude will not affect the result in finding the meridian, e.g., the
azimuth at 40 deg.44'
56", the difference (01' 35") being the correction for one degree of
latitude between 40 deg.Or, in other words, an error of one degree
in finding one's latitude would only introduce an error in the azimuth
of one and a half minutes.With ordinary care the probable error of the
latitude as determined from the method already described need not exceed
a few minutes, making the error in azimuth as laid off on the arc of an
ordinary transit graduated to single minutes, practically zero.REFRACTION TABLE FOR ANY ALTITUDE WITHIN THE LATITUDE OF THE UNITED

APPLICATIONS.In practice to find the true meridian, two observations must be made at
intervals of six hours, or they may be made upon different nights.The
first is for latitude, the second for azimuth at elongation.To make either, the surveyor should provide himself with a good transit
with vertical arc, a bull's eye, or hand lantern, plumb bobs, stakes,
etc.[1] Having "set up" over the point through which it is proposed to
establish the meridian, at a time when the line joining Polaris and
Alioth is nearly vertical, level the telescope by means of the attached
level, which should be in adjustment, set the vernier of the vertical
arc at zero, and take the reading.If the pole star is about making its
_upper_ transit, it will rise gradually until reaching the meridian as
it moves westward, and then as gradually descend.When near the highest
part of its orbit point the telescope at the star, having an assistant
to hold the "bull's eye" so as to reflect enough light down the tube
from the object end to illumine the cross wires but not to obscure the
star, or better, use a perforated silvered reflector, clamp the tube in
this position, and as the star continues to rise keep the _horizontal_
wire upon it by means of the tangent screw until it "rides" along this
wire and finally begins to fall below it.Take the reading of the
vertical arc and the result will be the observed altitude.[Footnote 1: A sextant and artificial horizon may be used to find the
_altitude_ of a star.In this case the observed angle must be divided by
2.]It is a little more accurate to find the altitude by taking the
complement of the observed zenith distance, if the vertical arc has
sufficient range.This is done by pointing first to Polaris when at
its highest (or lowest) point, reading the vertical arc, turning the
horizontal limb half way around, and the telescope over to get another
reading on the star, when the difference of the two readings will be the
_double_ zenith distance, and _half_ of this subtracted from 90 deg.The less the time intervening between these two
pointings, the more accurate the result will be.Having now found the altitude, correct it for refraction by subtracting
from it the amount opposite the observed altitude, as given in the
refraction table, and the result will be the latitude.The observer must
now wait about six hours until the star is at its western elongation,
or may postpone further operations for some subsequent night.In the
meantime he will take from the azimuth table the amount given for his
date and latitude, now determined, and if his observation is to be made
on the western elongation, he may turn it off on his instrument, so
that when moved to zero, _after_ the observation, the telescope will be
brought into the meridian or turned to the right, and a stake set by
means of a lantern or plummet lamp.[Illustration]

It is, of course, unnecessary to make this correction at the time of
observation, for the angle between any terrestrial object and the star
may be read and the correction for the azimuth of the star applied at
the surveyor's convenience.It is always well to check the accuracy of
the work by an observation upon the other elongation before putting in
permanent meridian marks, and care should be taken that they are not
placed near any local attractions.The meridian having been established,
the magnetic variation or declination may readily be found by setting
an instrument on the meridian and noting its bearing as given by the
needle.If, for example, it should be north 5 deg._east_, the variation is
west, because the north end of the needle is _west_ of the meridian, and
_vice versa_._Local time_ may also be readily found by observing the instant when the
sun's center[1] crosses the line, and correcting it for the equation of
time as given above--the result is the true or mean solar time.This,
compared with the clock, will show the error of the latter, and by
taking the difference between the local lime of this and any other
place, the difference of longitude is determined in hours, which can
readily be reduced to degrees by multiplying by fifteen, as 1 h.[Footnote 1: To obtain this time by observation, note the instant of
first contact of the sun's limb, and also of last contact of same, and
take the mean.]APPROXIMATE EQUATION OF TIME._______________________

THE OCELLATED PHEASANT.The collections of the Museum of Natural History of Paris have just been
enriched with a magnificent, perfectly adult specimen of a species of
bird that all the scientific establishments had put down among their
desiderata, and which, for twenty years past, has excited the curiosity
of naturalists.This species, in fact, was known only by a few caudal
feathers, of which even the origin was unknown, and which figured in the
galleries of the Jardin des Plantes under the name of _Argus ocellatus_.This name was given by J. Verreaux, who was then assistant naturalist at
the museum.L. Bonaparte, in his Tableaux
Paralleliques de l'Ordre des Gallinaces, as _Argus giganteus_, and a
few years later it was reproduced by Slater in his Catalogue of the
Phasianidae, and by Gray is his List of the Gallinaceae.But it was not
till 1871 and 1872 that Elliot, in the Annals and Magazine of Natural
History, and in a splendid monograph of the Phasianidae, pointed out
the peculiarities that were presented by the feathers preserved at the
Museum of Paris, and published a figure of them of the natural size.The discovery of an individual whose state of preservation leaves
nothing to be desired now comes to demonstrate the correctness of
Verreaux's, Bonaparte's, and Elliot's suppositions.This bird, whose
tail is furnished with feathers absolutely identical with those that
the museum possessed, is not a peacock, as some have asserted, nor an
ordinary Argus of Malacca, nor an argus of the race that Elliot named
_Argus grayi_, and which inhabits Borneo, but the type of a new genus of
the family Phasianidae.This Gallinacean, in fact, which Mr.Maingonnat
has given up to the Museum of Natural History, has not, like the common
Argus of Borneo, excessively elongated secondaries; and its tail is not
formed of normal rectrices, from the middle of which spring two very
long feathers, a little curved and arranged like a roof; but it consists
of twelve wide plane feathers, regularly tapering, and ornamented with
ocellated spots, arranged along the shaft.Its head is not bare, but is
adorned behind with a tuft of thread-like feathers; and, finally, its
system of coloration and the proportions of the different parts of its
body are not the same as in the common argus of Borneo.There is reason,
then, for placing the bird, under the name of _Rheinardius ocellatus_,
in the family Phasianidae, after the genus _Argus_ which it connects,
after a manner, with the pheasants properly so-called.The specific name
_ocellatus_ has belonged to it since 1871, and must be substituted for
that of _Rheinardi_.The bird measures more than two meters in length, three-fourths of which
belong to the tail.The head, which is relatively small, appears to be
larger than it really is, owing to the development of the piliform tuft
on the occiput, this being capable of erection so as to form a crest
0.05 to 0.06 of a meter in height.The feathers of this crest are
brown and white.The back and sides of the head are covered with downy
feathers of a silky brown and silvery gray, and the front of the neck
with piliform feathers of a ruddy brown.The upper part of the body is
of a blackish tint and the under part of a reddish brown, the whole
dotted with small white or _cafe-au-lait_ spots.Analogous spots are
found on the wings and tail, but on the secondaries these become
elongated, and tear-like in form.On the remiges the markings are quite
regularly hexagonal in shape; and on the upper coverts of the tail
and on the rectrices they are accompanied with numerous ferruginous
blotches, some of which are irregularly scattered over the whole surface
of the vane, while others, marked in the center with a blackish spot,
are disposed in series along the shaft and resemble ocelli.This
similitude of marking between the rectrices and subcaudals renders the
distinction between these two kinds of feathers less sharp than in many
other Gallinaceans, and the more so in that two median rectrices are
considerably elongated and assume exactly the aspect of tail feathers.[Illustration: THE OCELLATED PHEASANT (_Rheinardius ocellatus_).]They are all absolutely plane,
all spread out horizontally, and they go on increasing in length
from the exterior to the middle.They are quite wide at the point of
insertion, increase in diameter at the middle, and afterward taper to
a sharp point.Altogether they form a tail of extraordinary length and
width which the bird holds slightly elevated, so as to cause it to
describe a graceful curve, and the point of which touches the soil.The
beak, whose upper mandible is less arched than that of the pheasants,
exactly resembles that of the arguses.It is slightly inflated at the
base, above the nostrils, and these latter are of an elongated-oval
form.In the bird that I have before me the beak, as well as the feet
and legs, is of a dark rose-color.The legs are quite long and are
destitute of spurs.They terminate in front in three quite delicate
toes, connected at the base by membranes, and behind in a thumb that is
inserted so high that it scarcely touches the ground in walking.This
magnificent bird was captured in a portion of Tonkin as yet unexplored
by Europeans, in a locality named Buih-Dinh, 400 kilometers to the south
of Hue.--_La Nature_.*       *       *       *       *




THE MAIDENHAIR TREE.The Maidenhair tree--Gingkgo biloba--of which we give an illustration,
is not only one of our most ornamental deciduous trees, but one of the
most interesting.Few persons would at first sight take it to be a
Conifer, more especially as it is destitute of resin; nevertheless,
to that group it belongs, being closely allied to the Yew, but
distinguishable by its long-stalked, fan-shaped leaves, with numerous
radiating veins, as in an Adiantum.These leaves, like those of the
larch but unlike most Conifers, are deciduous, turning of a pale yellow
color before they fall.The tree is found in Japan and in China, but
generally in the neighborhood of temples or other buildings, and is, we
believe, unknown in a truly wild state.As in the case of several other
trees planted in like situations, such as Cupressus funebris, Abies
fortunei, A. kaempferi, Cryptomeria japonica, Sciadopitys verticillata,
it is probable that the trees have been introduced from Thibet, or
other unexplored districts, into China and Japan.Though now a solitary
representative of its genus, the Gingkgo was well represented in the
coal period, and also existed through the secondary and tertiary epochs,
Professor Heer having identified kindred specimens belonging to sixty
species and eight genera in fossil remains generally distributed through
the northern hemisphere.Whatever inference we may draw, it is at least
certain that the tree was well represented in former times, if now it
be the last of its race.It was first known to Kaempfer in 1690, and
described by him in 1712, and was introduced into this country in the
middle of the eighteenth century.Loudon relates a curious tale as
to the manner in which a French amateur became possessed of it.The
Frenchman, it appears, came to England, and paid a visit to an English
nurseryman, who was the possessor of five plants, raised from Japanese
seeds.The hospitable Englishman entertained the Frenchman only too
well.He allowed his commercial instincts to be blunted by wine, and
sold to his guest the five plants for the sum of 25 guineas.Next
morning, when time for reflection came, the Englishman attempted to
regain one only of the plants for the same sum that the Frenchman had
given for all five, but without avail.The plants were conveyed to
France, where as each plant had cost about 40 crowns, _ecus_, the tree
got the name of _arbre a quarante ecus_.This is the story as given by
Loudon, who tells us that Andre Thouin used to relate the fact in his
lectures at the Jardin des Plantes, whether as an illustration of the
perfidy of Albion is not stated.The tree is dioecious, bearing male catkins on one plant, female on
another.All the female trees in Europe are believed to have originated
from a tree near Geneva, of which Auguste Pyramus de Candolle secured
grafts, and distributed them throughout the Continent.Nevertheless, the
female tree is rarely met with, as compared with the male; but it is
quite possible that a tree which generally produces male flowers only
may sometimes bear female flowers only.We have no certain evidence of
this in the case of the Gingkgo, but it is a common enough occurrence in
other dioecious plants, and the occurrence of a fruiting specimen near
Philadelphia, as recently recorded by Mr.Meehan, may possibly be
attributed to this cause.The tree of which we give a figure is growing at Broadlands, Hants, and
is about 40 feet in height, with a trunk that measures 7 feet in girth
at 3 feet from the ground, with a spread of branches measuring 45 feet.These dimensions have been considerably exceeded in other cases.In 1837
a tree at Purser's Cross measured 60 feet and more in height.Loudon
himself had a small tree in his garden at Bayswater on which a female
branch was grafted.It is to be feared that this specimen has long since
perished.We have already alluded to its deciduous character, in which it is
allied to the larch.It presents another point of resemblance both to
the larch and the cedar in the short spurs upon which both leaves and
male catkins are borne, but these contracted branches are mingled with
long extension shoots; there seems, however, no regular alternation
between the short and the long shoots, at any rate the _rationale_ of
their production is not understood, though in all probability a little
observation of the growing plant would soon clear the matter up.The fruit is drupaceous, with a soft outer coat and a hard woody shell,
greatly resembling that of a Cycad, both externally and internally.Whether the albumen contains the peculiar "corpuscles" common to Cycads
and Conifers, we do not for certain know, though from the presence of 2
to 3 embryos in one seed, as noted by Endlicher, we presume this is the
case.The interest of these corpuscles, it may be added, lies in the
proof of affinity they offer between Conifers and the higher Cryptogams,
such as ferns and lycopods--an affinity shown also in the peculiar
venation of the Gingkgo.Conifers are in some degree links between
ordinary flowering plants and the higher Cryptogams, and serve to
connect in genealogical sequence groups once considered quite distinct.In germination the two fleshy cotyledons of the Gingkgo remain within
the shell, leaving the three-sided plumule to pass upward; the young
stem bears its leaves in threes.We have no desire to enter further upon the botanical peculiarities of
this tree; enough if we have indicated in what its peculiar interest
consists.We have only to add that in gardens varieties exist some with
leaves more deeply cut than usual, others with leaves nearly entire, and
others with leaves of a golden-yellow color.--_Gardeners' Chronicle_.[Illustration: THE MAIDENHAIR TREE IN THE GARDENS AT BROADLANDS.]*       *       *       *       *




THE WOODS OF AMERICA.A collection of woods without a parallel in the world is now being
prepared for exhibition by the Directors of the American Museum of
Natural History.Scattered about the third floor of the Arsenal, in
Central Park, lie 394 logs, some carefully wrapped in bagging,
some inclosed in rough wooden cases, and others partially sawn
longitudinally, horizontally, and diagonally.These logs represent all
but 26 of the varieties of trees indigenous to this country, and
nearly all have a greater or less economic or commercial value.The 26
varieties needed to complete the collection will arrive before winter
sets in, a number of specimens being now on their way to this city from
the groves of California.S. D. Dill and a number of assistants are
engaged in preparing the specimens for exhibition.The logs as they
reach the workroom are wrapped in bagging and inclosed in cases, this
method being used so that the bark, with its growth of lichens and
delicate exfoliations, shall not be injured while the logs are in
process of transportation from various parts of the country to this
city.The logs are each 6 feet in length, and each is the most perfect
specimen of its class that could be found by the experts employed in
making the collection.With the specimens of the trees come to the
museum also specimens of the foliage and the fruits and flowers of the
tree.These come from all parts of the Union--from Alaska on the north
to Texas on the south, from Maine on the east to California on the
west--and there is not a State or Territory in the Union which has not a
representative in this collection of logs.On arrival here the logs are
green, and the first thing in the way of treatment after their arrival
is to season them, a work requiring great care to prevent them from
"checking," as it is technically called, or "season cracking," as the
unscientific term the splitting of the wood in radiating lines during
the seasoning process.As is well known, the sap-wood of a tree seasons
much more quickly than does the heart of the wood.The prevention of
this splitting is very necessary in preparing these specimens for
exhibition, for when once the wood has split its value for dressing for
exhibition is gone.A new plan to prevent this destruction of specimens
is now being tried with some success under the direction of Prof.Into the base of the log and
alongside the heart a deep hole is bored with an auger.As the wood
seasons this hole permits of a pressure inward and so has in many
instances doubtless saved valuable specimens.One of the finest in the
collection, a specimen of the persimmon tree, some two feet in diameter,
has been ruined by the seasoning process.On one side there is a huge
crack, extending from the top to the bottom of the log, which looks as
though some amateur woodman had attempted to split it with an ax and
had made a poor job of it.The great shrinking of the sap-wood of the
persimmon tree makes the wood of but trifling value commercially.It also has a discouraging effect upon collectors, as it is next to
impossible to cure a specimen, so that all but this one characteristic
of the wood can be shown to the public in a perfect form.Before the logs become thoroughly seasoned, or their lines of growth at
all obliterated, a diagram of each is made, showing in accordance with
a regular scale the thickness of the bark, the sap-wood, and the heart.There is also in this diagram a scale showing the growth of the tree
during each year of its life, these yearly growths being regularly
marked about the heart of the tree by move or less regular concentric
circles, the width of which grows smaller and smaller as the tree grows
older.In this connection attention may be called to a specimen in the
collection which is considered one of the most remarkable in the world.It is not a native wood, but an importation, and the tree from which
this wonderful slab is cut is commonly known as the "Pride of India."The heart of this particular tree was on the port side, and between it
and the bark there is very little sap-wood, not more than an inch.On the starbord side, so to speak, the sap-wood has grown out in an
abnormal manner, and one of the lines indicative of a year's growth is
one and seven-eighths inches in width, the widest growth, many experts
who have seen the specimen say, that was ever recorded.The diagrams
referred to are to be kept for scientific uses, and the scheme of
exhibition includes these diagrams as a part of the whole.After a log has become seasoned it is carefully sawed through the center
down about one-third of its length.A transverse cut is then made and
the semi-cylindrical section thus severed from the log is removed.The
upper end is then beveled.When a log is thus treated the inspector can
see the lower two-thirds presenting exactly the same appearance it did
when growing in the forest.The horizontal cut, through the sap-wood
and to the center of the heart, shows the life lines of the tree, and
carefully planed as are this portion, the perpendicular and the beveled
sections, the grain of the wood can thus be plainly seen.That these may
be made even more valuable to the architect and artisan, the right half
of this planed surface will be carefully polished, and the left half
left in the natural state.This portion of the scheme of treatment is
entirely in the interests of architects and artisans, and it is expected
by Prof.Bickmore that it will be the means of securing for some kinds
of trees, essentially of American growth, and which have been virtually
neglected, an important place in architecture and in ornamental
wood-work, and so give a commercial value to woods that are now of
comparatively little value.Among the many curious specimens in the collection now being prepared
for exhibition, one which will excite the greatest curiosity is a
specimen of the honey locust, which was brought here from Missouri.The bark is covered with a growth of thorns from one to four inches
in length, sharp as needles, and growing at irregular intervals.The
specimen arrived here in perfect condition, but, in order that it might
be transported without injury, it had to be suspended from the roof of
a box car, and thus make its trip from Southern Missouri to this city
without change.Another strange specimen in the novel collection is a
portion of the Yucca tree, an abnormal growth of the lily family.The
trunk, about 2 feet in diameter, is a spongy mass, not susceptible of
treatment to which the other specimens are subjected.Its bark is an
irregular stringy, knotted mass, with porcupine-quill-like leaves
springing out in place of the limbs that grow from all well-regulated
trees.One specimen of the yucca was sent to the museum two years ago,
and though the roots and top of the tree were sawn off, shoots sprang
out, and a number of the handsome flowers appeared.The tree was
supposed to be dead and thoroughly seasoned by this Fall, but now, when
the workmen are ready to prepare it for exhibition, it has shown new
life, new shoots have appeared, and two tufts of green now decorate the
otherwise dry and withered log, and the yucca promises to bloom again
before the winter is over.One of the most perfect specimens of the
Douglass spruce ever seen is in the collection, and is a decided
curiosity.It is a recent arrival from the Rocky Mountains.Its bark,
two inches or more in thickness, is perforated with holes reaching to
the-sap-wood.Many of these contain acorns, or the remains of acorns,
which have been stored there by provident woodpeckers, who dug the holes
in the bark and there stored their winter supply of food.The oldest
specimen in the collection is a section of the _Picea engelmanni_, a
species of spruce growing in the Rocky Mountains at a considerable
elevation above the sea.The specimen is 24 inches in diameter, and the
concentric circles show its age to be 410 years.The wood much resembles
the black spruce, and is the most valuable of the Rocky Mountain
growths.A specimen of the nut pine, whose nuts are used for food by the
Indians, is only 15 inches in diameter, and yet its life lines show its
age to be 369 years.The largest specimen yet received is a section of
the white ash, which is 46 inches in diameter and 182 years old.The
next largest specimen is a section of the _Platanus occidentalis_,
variously known in commerce as the sycamore, button-wood, or plane tree,
which is 42 inches in diameter and only 171 years of age.Specimens of
the redwood tree of California are now on their way to this city from
the Yosemite Valley.One specimen, though a small one, measures 5 feet
in diameter and shows the character of the wood.A specimen of
the enormous growths of this tree was not secured because of the
impossibility of transportation and the fact that there would be no room
in the museum for the storage of such a specimen, for the diameter of
the largest tree of the class is 45 feet and 8 inches, which represents
a circumference of about 110 feet.Then, too, the Californians object to
have the giant trees cut down for commercial, scientific, or any other
purposes.To accompany these specimens of the woods of America, Mr.Morris K.
Jesup, who has paid all the expense incurred in the collection of
specimens, is having prepared as an accompanying portion of the
exhibition water color drawings representing the actual size, color,
and appearance of the fruit, foliage, and flowers of the various trees.Their commercial products, as far as they can be obtained, will also be
exhibited, as, for instance, in the case of the long-leaved pine, the
tar, resin, and pitch, for which it is especially valued.Then, too, in
an herbarium the fruits, leaves, and flowers are preserved as nearly as
possible in their natural state.When the collection is ready for public
view next spring it will be not only the largest, but the only complete
one of its kind in the country.There is nothing like it in the world,
as far as is known; certainly not in the royal museums of England,
France, or Germany.Aside from the value of the collection, in a scientific way, it is
proposed to make it an adjunct to our educational system, which requires
that teachers shall instruct pupils as to the materials used for food
and clothing.The completeness of the exhibition will be of great
assistance also to landscape gardeners, as it will enable them to lay
out private and public parks so that the most striking effects of
foliage may be secured.The beauty of these effects can best be seen in
this country in our own Central Park, where there are more different
varieties and more combinations for foliage effects than in any other
area in the United States.To ascertain how these effects are obtained
one now has to go to much trouble to learn the names of the trees.With
this exhibition such information can be had merely by observation, for
the botanical and common names of each specimen will be attached to
it.It will also be of practical use in teaching the forester how to
cultivate trees as he would other crops.The rapid disappearance of
many valuable forest trees, with the increase in demand and decrease in
supply, will tend to make the collection valuable as a curiosity in
the not far distant future as representing the extinct trees of the
country.--_N.Y.*       *       *       *       *

      | INDEX TO THE THIRD VOLUME.Otherwise,
the good can not be externalized.If you did that, your problem would
be quickly solved.""Padre dear," she continued, "God is
life--there is no death.God is all
good--there is no poverty, no lack, no loss.God is infinite, and He
is mind--there is no inability to see the right and to do it.God is
my mind, my spirit, my soul, my all.I look at God constantly, and strive always to see only Him.But He is just as much to you as He is to me.You can not outline how
things will work out; but you can know that they can only work out in
the right way.Only by so doing can
you solve your problem.And I have
always worked for you that way.I have always thought the time would
come when you and I would live and work together--always.I have not said that it _had_ to be.If it works
out that way, I know I would be very happy.But, even if it does not,
I shall know that I can not be deprived of any good, for the good God
is everywhere, and He is love, and He has given me all happiness.And
now we must leave everything to Him, while we work, work, work to see
Him only everywhere."Suffering himself to be led by her, they
crossed the shales to the dust-laden road and made their way silently
through the burning heat into the village.At the door of the parish house stood Rosendo.His face was grave, but
his manner calm."Padre," he announced, "it is arranged."Jose's knees shook under him as he followed the old man into the
house.Reed, Harris, and Don Jorge sat about the table, on which were
strewn papers covered with figures and sketches.The priest sat down
dumbly and drew Carmen to him.Harris fell to devouring the girl with
his bulging eyes.Reed at once plunged into the topic under
consideration."I have been saying," he began, addressing the priest, "that I can
accept the proposal made by Don Rosendo, but with some amendments.Harris and I are under contract with the Molino Company to report upon
their properties along the Boque river.I am informed by Don Rosendo
that he is acquainted with these alleged mines, and knows them to be
worthless.Be that as it may, I am obliged to examine them.But I will
agree to take this girl to New York, under the protection of my wife,
upon the consideration that when I reach my home city I be allowed to
form a company to take over this mine, returning to the girl a
fifty-one per cent interest in the stock, one half of which she agrees
in writing to deliver to me immediately upon its issuance.Being under
contract, I can not accept it now.The balance of the stock must be
sold for development purposes.I further agree to place the girl in a
boarding school of the first quality in the States, and to bear all
expenses of her maintenance until such time as she is either
self-supporting, or one or several of you may come to her, or effect
her return to Colombia.Now, according to Ariza's sketches, we may
proceed up the Boque river to its headwaters--how far did you say,
friend?""Some hundred and fifty miles from Simiti, senor," replied Rosendo."And then," resumed Reed, "we can cut across country from the sources
of the Boque, following what is known as Rosario creek, down to the
river Tigui, striking the latter somewhere near the ancient point
known as La Colorado.""But, senor," interposed Rosendo, "remember that the headwaters of the
Boque are practically unknown to-day.Many years ago, when I was a
small lad, some liberated slaves worked along Rosario creek, which was
then one day's journey on foot with packs from La Colorado.But that
old trail has long since disappeared.Probably no one has been over it
since.""Very well," returned the practical Reed, "then we shall have to make
our own trail across the divide to the Tigui.But once at La Colorado,
you tell me there is an ancient trail that leads down to Llano, on the
Nechi river?""Yes, to the mouth of the Amaceri.Llano was something of a town long
ago.But river steamers that go up the Nechi as far as Zaragoza once a
month, or less frequently, still touch there, I am told.And so you
can get down the Cauca to Maganguey, where you can change to a
Magdalena river boat for Calamar.The trail
to Llano can not be more than fifty miles in length, and fairly
open."Harris, who had been studying the sketches, whistled softly.he muttered, "nearly two hundred miles, and all by foot, over
unspeakable jungle trails!""Very well, then," he continued, "we
had best set out as soon as possible.To you, friend Rosendo, I leave
all arrangements regarding supplies and _cargadores_.I will furnish
funds for the entire expedition, expecting to be reimbursed by La
Libertad."Carmen listened, with dilated eyes.Starting hurriedly after Rosendo, who rose immediately to inaugurate
preparations, he drew him into the latter's house.he
cried, his whole frame tremulous with agitation, "do you know what you
are doing?Do you--"

"_Na_, Padre," replied Rosendo gently, as he held up a restraining
hand, "it is best.I want the _Americanos_ to take Carmen.At any moment an order might come for your arrest or
mine.The struggle has been long, and I weary of it."He sat down in
exhaustion and mopped his damp brow.If I can but know that she is safe--_Bien_, that is all.From what we
have learned, this country will soon be plunged again into war.I do
not wish to live through another revolution.I seem
to have fought all my life.I doubt
if I could even hold it, were it known here that I had the title to
such a famous mine.But the _Americano_ can hold it.He will save Carmen's interest, and deal fairly with her._Bien_, let him place her in a school in the States.If you weather
the oncoming revolution, then you may be able to send for her."Rosendo," he said, "I will go with her.""Do you mean, Padre, that you
will leave the Church?""Can I remain longer in Simiti, where the people have become
divided--where they look upon me askance, as the cause of the trouble
that has befallen them?What, think you, will it mean to Simiti?And Wenceslas,
what has he further in store for you and me?What he has for Carmen,
we well know.But the disappearance
of Diego has not been explained.The trick which Anita played upon
Morales to save Carmen must bring down increased wrath upon our heads,
especially yours and mine.No, Rosendo, you and I must go, and go at
once!""We will pick her up in Cartagena.I have certain information to give him that will enlist his
services--information which, I think, will serve to introduce him
to His Grace, and somewhat abruptly.But, come, Rosendo, do you and
Dona Maria prepare for flight!"I will go with
the _Americanos_ up the Boque and to La Libertad.Then I will return
to Simiti--or to the _hacienda_ of Don Nicolas, if Maria wishes to
remain there while I am in the hills.But--do you go, Padre--go and
look after the girl.Yes,
Padre, go--go!""But--ah, Rosendo, you will reconsider?The Americans will take us all
for that mine!"No, Padre," said the old man firmly, but in a voice heavy with
sadness.My work is done when I have
seen the girl safely out of this unhappy country.Carmen came bounding in and flew into Rosendo's arms.she cried, aglow with animation, "we are all going to the States up
north!Oh, padre, isn't it beautiful!""Ah, _chiquita_," said Rosendo cheerily, straining her to him, "I
guess we have decided to send you on ahead--a little ahead of us.Your
old padre has some business he must attend to here before he leaves."Jose knew what his effort at cheerfulness was
costing him."But, padre Rosendo, you will come--later?She
looked into his eyes, pleading wistfully."Yes, little one, yes--of course.For where you are, there your old
padre will always be--always--always!"panted the girl under Rosendo's tight grasp as she
turned her head toward the priest."He goes with us," assured Rosendo--"I think--at least as far as the
coast.He will see Anita--and--" His voice broke, and he turned
abruptly away."And she will go to the States with us!cried the girl,
bounding up and down with joy.Jose turned and went quickly into his own house.With grim determination
he drew the battered haircloth trunk from beneath his bed and began
to throw his few effects into it.But he had scarce begun when Juan, now bearing the proud title of
official courier between Simiti and Bodega Central, entered with a
letter.Jose recognized the writing, and tore it open at once."My beloved son, at last, after these many years of most rigid
economy, even of privation, I have saved enough from my meager income,
together with what little you have been able to send me from time to
time, and a recent generous contribution from your dear uncle, to
enable me to visit you.I shall sail for Colombia just as soon as you
send me detailed instructions regarding the journey.And, oh, my son,
to see you offering the Mass in your own church, and to realize that
your long delayed preferment is even at hand, for so your good uncle
informs me daily, will again warm the blood in a heart long chilled by
poignant suffering.Till we meet, the Blessed Virgin shield you, my
beloved son."The letter slipped from the priest's fingers and drifted to the floor.With a moan he sank into a chair and buried his face in his hands.CHAPTER 36


What had kept Jose de Rincon chained all these years to an institution
to which in thought, feeling, and sympathy he was so utterly alien, we
have repeatedly pointed out--a warped sense of filial devotion, a
devotion that would not willingly bring sorrow upon his proud,
sensitive mother, and yet the kind that so often accomplishes just
that which it strives to avoid.But yet he had somehow failed to note
the nice distinction which he was always making between the promises
he had given to her and the oath which he had taken at his ordination.He had permitted himself to be held to the Church by his mother's fond
desires, despite the fact that his nominal observance of these had
wrecked his own life and all but brought her in sorrow to the grave.The abundance of his misery might be traced to forgetfulness of the
sapient words of Jesus: "For whosoever shall do the will of my Father
which is in heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother."And he had sacrificed his new-found life to the
child.He had exhausted every expedient to keep himself in Simiti,
that he might transfer his own great learning to this girl, and at the
same time yield himself to her beneficent influence.Yet, despite his
vague hopes, he had always dimly seen the day when she would leave
him; but he had likewise tried to feel that when it arrived his own
status would be such that the ecclesiastical ties which bound him
would be loosened, and he would be free to follow her.the lapse
of years had brought little change in that respect.But now he saw the girl entering upon that very hour of departure
which all his life in Simiti had hung like a menacing cloud above
him.And the shock had been such that he had thrown every other
consideration to the winds, and, regardless of consequences, was madly
preparing to accompany her.Then, like a voice from the tomb, had come
his mother's letter.Indeed, for the past two nights sleep had
avoided his haggard eyes.In the feeble glow of his candle he sat in
his little bedroom by his rough, bare table, far into the hours of
morning, struggling, resolving, hoping, despairing--and, at last,
yielding.If he had been born anew that fateful day, seven years
before, when Rosendo first told him the girl's story, he had this
night again died.When the gray hours of dawn stole silently across
the distant hills he rose.He staggered as he passed out through the living room where
lay the sleeping Americans.Rosendo met him in front of the house.exclaimed the old man as he noted the priest's appearance."Do not speak of it, Rosendo."It has been hard on you, Padre.And in the States with her--"

"For God's sake, friend, never speak of that again!"How long will it take to complete your preparations?""_Bien_," returned the amazed Rosendo when he recovered his breath,
"we can get away to-morrow."But you--"

"Hear me, friend.Everything must be conducted in the greatest
secrecy.It must be given out that the Americans go to explore the
Boque; that you accompany them as guide; that Carmen goes as--as cook,
why not?""_Cierto_, she cooks as well as Maria."Juan must be kept in complete ignorance of the real nature
of your trip.He is the courier--I will see
that Fernando sends him again to Bodega Central to-morrow, and keeps
him there for several days.You say it is some two hundred miles to
Llano.How long will it take to go that distance?""Why--_Quien sabe_, Padre?""With a
fair trail, and allowing the _Americanos_ some time to prospect on the
Boque--where they will find nothing--and several days to look over La
Libertad, we ought to reach Llano in six weeks.""A week later, if you do not have to wait a month on the river bank
for the boat.""Then, all going well, within two months Carmen should be out of the
country."You and she--"

"Enough, friend."Go now and bid Carmen come to me immediately after the _desayuno_.Tell Dona Maria that I will eat nothing this morning.I am going up to
the old church on the hill."But Jose turned abruptly and
started away, leaving the old man in a maze of bewilderment.In the gloom of the old church Jose threw himself upon a bench near
the door, and waited torpidly.A few moments later came a voice, and
then the soft patter of bare feet in the thick dust without.Carmen
was talking as she approached.Jose rose in curiosity; but the girl
was alone.In her hand she held a scrubby flower that had drawn a
desperate nourishment from the barren soil at the roadside.She
glanced up at Jose and smiled."It is easy to understand their language, isn't it, Padre?They don't
speak as we do, but they reflect.They stand for His ideas in the human mind.And I. Aren't they wonderful, these flowers!But you know,
they are only the way we interpret certain of God's wonderful ideas.Only, because we mortals believe in death, we see these beautiful
things at last reflecting our thought of death--don't we?We see only
our thoughts, after all.Everything we see about us is reflected
thought.First we see our thoughts of life and beauty and good.And
then our thoughts of decay and death."But God--He never sees anything but the good," she went on."He sees
the real, not the supposition.And when we learn to see only as He
does, why, then we will never again see death.We will see ourselves
as we really are, immortal.Jesus learned
to see that way, didn't he?His thought was finally so pure that he
saw nothing but good.And that gave him such power that he did those
things that the poor, ignorant, wrong-thinking people called miracles.But they were only the things that you and I and everybody else ought
to be doing to-day--and would be doing, if we thought as he did,
instead of thinking of evil."But," she panted, as she sat down beside him, "I've talked a lot,
haven't I?And you sent for me because you wanted to talk.But,
remember," holding up an admonitory finger, "I shall not listen if you
talk anything but good.Oh, Padre dear," looking up wistfully into his
drawn face, "you are still thinking that two and two are seven!How can you ever expect to see good if
you look only at evil?If I looked only at wilted flowers I would
never know there were any others.""Carmen," he said in a hollow voice, "I love you.""Why, of course you do," returned the artless girl.You have just _got_ to love me and everything and everybody.But it had been floating like foam on
his tossing mind."You are going away from me," he continued, almost in a whisper."Why, no, Padre," she replied quickly; "you are going too!Padre
Rosendo said we could start to-morrow at sunrise.""I do not go," he said in a quavering voice.What meant this change which had
come over him so suddenly?His mother's face hovered before him in the dim light.Behind her
a mitered head, symbolizing the Church, nodded and beckoned
significantly.Back of them, as they stood between him and the
girl, he saw the glorified vision of Carmen.He
turned wearily from it to the gentle presence at his side."I stay--to work out--my problem," was his scarcely audible reply.But her breath came more quickly, and her hand
closed more tightly about his."Dearest one," he murmured, bending over the brown curls, "it is God's
way, I guess.Perhaps in the years which I have spent here with you I
have had the time and the opportunity to work out my salvation.But, though I strove in my way, I could not quickly
acquire your spirituality.I could not at once shake loose those
poisonous thoughts of a lifetime, which have at last become
externalized in separation from all that I hold dearest in this life,
you, my beloved girl, you."He buried his face in her luxuriant hair
and strove to hold back the rush of scalding tears."It but shows how poisonous thoughts separate us from all that is
good--even from God," he continued in a choked voice."Oh, my sweet
girl, I love you as it seems to me no human being could love another!It has been so from that first day when, a mere babe, your wonderful
eyes held me until I could read in them a depth of love for mankind
that was divine."It did not seem to him that a mature man was
speaking to a mere girl.She seemed, as always, ages beyond him in
wisdom and experience.Carmen reached up and wound her arms about his neck.He bent low and
kissed her brow.Then he drew himself up quickly and resumed his
broken talk."I believed at first that my salvation lay in you.And so it did, for
from your clear thought I gleaned my first satisfying knowledge of the
great principle, God.I could not seem to realize that
between recognizing righteousness as 'right-thinking' and daily
practicing it so as to 'prove' God there was a great difference.And
so I rested easy in my first gleams of truth, expecting that they
would so warm my soul that it would expand of itself out of all
error."She made as if to reply, but he checked her."I learned enough, I repeat, those first few months here to have
enabled me to work out my salvation, even though with fear and
trembling.But I procrastinated; I vacillated; I still clung to
effete beliefs and forms of thought which I knew were bound to
manifest in unhappiness later.I was afraid to boldly throw myself
upon my thought.Yes, the great Paul was at times
under the same mesmeric spell of human belief, even after he had seen
the vision of the Christ.And now
I see that I must do likewise, for salvation is an individual
experience.No vicarious effort, even of the Christ himself, can save
a man.We must apply it to our
problems ourselves.My unfinished task--scarcely even begun!--lies
still before me.My environment is what I have made it by my own
thought.I believe you, that I can enter another only as I externalize
it through righteousness, right-thinking, and 'proving' God."He paused and bent over the silent little figure nestling so quietly
at his side."You, Carmen, though but a child in years, have risen beyond me, and
beyond this lowly encompassment.Why, when you were a mere babe, you
should have grasped your padre Rosendo's casual statement that 'God is
everywhere,' and shaped your life to accord with it, I do not know.That must remain one of the hidden mysteries of God.But
the fact stands that you did grasp it, and that with it as a light
unto your feet you groped your way out of this environment, avoiding
all pitfalls and evil snares, until to-day you stand at the threshold
of another and higher one.So progress must ever be, I now realize.Up
we must rise from one plane of human mentality to another, sifting and
sorting the thoughts that come to us, clinging to these, discarding
those, until, even as you have said, we learn at last instantly to
accept those that mirror forth God, infinite, divine mind, and to
reject those that bear the stamp of supposition.""Padre," the girl said, lifting her beautiful face to his, "I have
told you so often--when a thought comes to me that I think is not from
God, or does not reflect Him, I turn right on it and kill it.You
could do the same, if you would.""Assuredly, child--if I would!"And then the millennium would be with us, and the
kingdom of heaven revealed.The mesmeric belief in evil as an entity
and a power opposed to good alone prevents that.Destroy this belief,
and the curtain will instantly rise on eternity."His eyes struggled with hers, as he gazed long and wistfully into
them.Lost in his impassioned speech, he had for the moment seemed to
be translated.Then a surge of fear-thoughts swept him, and left him
dwelling on the hazardous journey that awaited her.He wildly clutched
her again to his side."Carmen--child--how can I let you go!And that
awful journey--two hundred miles of unknown jungle, to the far-off
Nechi!And then the burning river, to Cartagena, where--where _he_ is!And the States--God, what awaits you there!""Padre," she answered softly, "I shall not go unless it is right.If
it is right, then God will take care of me--and of you."Again she saw only the "right-best" thought, while he sat trembling
before its opposite.And the opposite was as yet a supposition!"Padre dear, there is no separation, you know.God is everywhere, and
so there is no separation from good--is there?""Not in your thought, dearest child," he murmured huskily."Well, Padre dear, I am still with you, am I not?Can't you live one
day at a time?You are borrowing from
to-morrow, and you have no right to do it.God says,
'Thou shalt not steal,' even from to-morrow."The thought seemed to
lighten his load momentarily."You have been thinking so many bad thoughts of late--I don't suppose
you have had any good thoughts at all about Anita's little babe?"You promised me that every day you
would just _know_ that."Aye, his crowning sin was revealed again in
all its ugly nakedness.His thought was always of his own
troubles, his own longings, his own fears.Self-centeredness had left
no room for thoughts of Ana's blind babe.And why was he now straining
this beautiful girl to himself?Was it fear for her, or for himself?Yet she gave but little heed to her own needs.Always her concern was
for others, others who stumbled and drooped because of the human
mind's false, unreal, undemonstrable beliefs and ignorance of the
allness of God."Ah, child," he exclaimed penitently, "such love!How could I dare to
hope ever to claim it!"Why, Padre, I love the real 'you,' the 'you' that is going to be
brought out, and that will become more and more clear, until at last
it stands as the perfect reflection of God.Haven't I told you that,
time and time again?"But--to live with me--to be my--"

"Well, Padre, if we were not still human we would not be thinking that
we were on earth.We have got to work out of this human way of
thinking and living.And it has seemed to me that you and I could work
out of it so much better together, you helping me, manifesting God's
protection and care, and I helping you, as you say I can and do.And
how can we live together and work together unless we marry?He would not try to explain her reasoning, her contempt for
convention.As for him, women had never
constituted a temptation.He knew that he loved this simple, ingenuous
girl with a tenderness of passion that was wholly free from the dross
of mesmerism."Padre, if you think you must stay here for a little while, to work
out your problem, why, I shall just _know_ that evil can not separate
us.I don't like to even seem to go away without you.But--it will be
only seeming, after all, won't it?God's children can not really be
separated--never!"She was still paying faithful tribute to her vision of the spiritual
universe.How like a benison they
flowed over his drooping spirits!"And now, Padre dear," she said, rising from the bench,--"we have done
all we could--left everything with God--haven't we?I must go now, for
madre Maria told me to come back soon.Sing
again the sweet melody that I heard when I awoke from the fever that
day long ago!"Nestling close against him, her
head resting on his shoulder and her hand in his, she sang again the
song that had seemed to lift him that distant day far, far above the
pitiful longings and strivings of poor humanity, even unto the gates
of the city of eternal harmony.She finished, and the last clear, sweet note echoed through the musty
room and died among the black rafters overhead.A holy silence fell
upon them as they sat, hand in hand, facing the future.Hot tears were
streaming down the man's cheeks.They fell sparkling like drops of
dew upon her brown curls.The girl, obedient
to the vision, was reaping her reward.He, timid, wavering, doubting,
was left, still pecking at the shell of his dreary environment.It was
but the working of the infinite law of cause and effect.But did he
imagine that out in the world she would not still find tribulation,
even as the Saviour had said?But she
leaned on her sustaining God.She had already passed through such fiery trials that
he knew no contrary belief in evil now could weaken or counterbalance
her supreme confidence in immanent good."If I have to go and leave you, will you promise me that you will act
your knowledge of the Christ-principle and work out your problem, so
that you may come to me soon?"The tug at his heartstrings brought a moan to his lips."And--you will keep your promise about Anita's babe?"She rose and, still holding his hand, led him down the hill and to
Rosendo's house.Throughout the remainder of that feverishly busy day the priest clung
to the girl like a shadow.They talked together but little, for she
was in constant demand to help her foster-mother in the preparations
for the long journey.Again and again
he would seize her hand and press it to his burning lips.Again and
again he would stroke her soft hair, or stretch out his hand to touch
her dress as she passed him.Always when she glanced up at him the
same sweet, compassionate smile glowed on her face.When she left the
house, he followed.When she bent over the ash-strewn fireplace, or
washed the few plain dishes, he sought to share her employment; and,
when gently, lovingly repulsed, sat dully, with his yearning eyes
riveted upon her.Rosendo saw him, and forgot his own sorrow in pity
for the suffering priest.The preparations carried the toilers far into the night.But at length
the last bundle was strapped to its _siete_, the last plan discussed
and agreed upon, and the two Americans had thrown themselves upon
their cots for a brief rest before dawn.Rosendo took Jose aside,
while Dona Maria and Carmen sought their beds."Fernando sends Juan to Bodega Central at daybreak," the old man said.Maria remains
here with you until I return.Then we may go to the _hacienda_ of Don
Nicolas, on the Boque.I shall tell him to have it in readiness on my
return.I shall probably not get back to Simiti for two months.If, as
you say, you still think best not to go with the Americans and the
girl, what will you do here?Some say
they intend to ask the Bishop to remove you._Bien_, will you not
decide to go?"He shook his head, and waved
Rosendo away.Then, taking a chair, he went into the sleeping room and
sat down at the bedside of the slumbering girl.Reaching over, he took
her hand.What was it that she had said to him that day, long gone, when Diego
claimed her as his child?Ah, yes:

"Don't feel badly, Padre dear.His thoughts have only the minus
sign--and that means nothing, you know."And later, many weeks later:

"Padre, you can not think wrong and right thoughts together, you know.You can not be happy and unhappy at the same time.You can not be sick
and well together."In other words, the wise little maid was trying to
show him that Paul spoke directly to such as he when he wrote: Know ye
not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants
ye are--?"You can not have both good and evil, Padre," she had so often
insisted."You must want good--want it more than anything else.And
then you must prepare for it by thinking right thoughts and unthinking
wrong ones.And as you prepare for good, you must _know_ that it is
coming.But you must not say how it shall come, nor what it shall look
like.You must not say that it shall be just as you may think you
would like to have it."You see, Padre dear"--oh, how the memory of her words smote him
now!--"you see, the good Jesus told the people to clean their
window-panes and let in the light--good thoughts--for then these would
be externalized in health, happiness, and all good, instead of the
old, bad thoughts being externalized longer in sickness and evil.He saw that the Christ-idea found expression and
reflection in the pure mentality of this girl.He saw that that
mentality was unsullied, uneducated in the lore of human belief, and
untrained to fear.He saw that the resurrection of the Christ, for
which a yearning world waits, was but the rising of the Christ-idea
in the human mentality.And he saw, too, that ere the radiant
resurrection morn can arrive there must be the crucifixion, a
world-wide crucifixion of human, carnal thought.But will ye not learn that following him means _thinking_
as he did?But Jose had tried to think aright during those years in Simiti.True,
but the efforts had been spasmodic.From childhood he had passed
through doubt, fear, scepticism, and final agnosticism.Then he had
started anew and aright.And then had come the "day of judgment," the
recurrent hours of sore trial--and he had not stood.Called upon to
prove God, to prove the validity of his splendid deductions, he had
vacillated between the opposing claims of good and evil, and had
floundered helplessly.And now he stood confronting his still unsolved
problem, realizing as never before that in the solving of it he must
unlearn the intellectual habits of a lifetime.There were other problems which lay still unsolved before him as he
sat there that night.The sable veil of mystery which hung about
Carmen's birth had never been penetrated, even slightly.What woman's
face was that which looked out so sadly from the little locket?"Dolores"--sorrowful, indeed!What tragedy had those great, mournful
eyes witnessed?He used to
think so, but not of late.Did she, he wondered, resemble the man?And
had the mother's kisses and hot tears blurred the portrait beneath
which he had so often read the single inscription, "Guillermo"?If so,
could not the portrait be cleaned?But Jose himself had not dared
attempt it.Perhaps some day that could be done by one skilled in such
art.And did Carmen inherit any of her unique traits from either of her
parents?Her voice, her religious instinct, her keen mentality--whence
came they?"From God," the girl would always answer whenever he voiced
the query in her presence.And Jose found himself sitting beside the
sleeping girl and dumbly yielding to the separation which now had
come.And, if he must live and
solve his problem, could he stand after she had left?He bent closer
to her, and listened to the gentle breathing.He seemed again to see
her, as he was wont in the years past, flitting about her diminutive
rose garden and calling to him to come and share her boundless joy."Come, Padre dear, and see my beautiful
thoughts!"And then, so often, "Oh, Padre!"bounding into his arms,
"here is a beautiful thought that came to me to-day, and I caught it
and wouldn't let it go!"Lonely, isolated child, having nothing in
common with the children of her native heath, yet dwelling ever in a
world peopled with immaculate concepts!He thought of the day when he had
approached Rosendo with his great question."Rosendo," he had said in
deep earnestness, "where, oh, where did Carmen get these ideas?"No, Padre," Rosendo had replied gravely."When she was a little
thing, just learning to talk, she often asked about God.And one day I
told her that God was everywhere--what else could I say?_Bien_, a
strange light came into her eyes.And after that, Padre, she talked
continually about Him, and to Him.And she seemed to know Him well--so
well that she saw Him in every thing and every place.Padre, it is
very strange--very strange!"No, it was not strange, Jose had thought, but beautifully natural.And
later, when he came to teach her, his constant endeavor had been to
impart his secular knowledge to the girl without endangering her
marvelous faith in her immanent God.In that he had succeeded, for in
that there had been no obstructing thoughts of self to overcome.And now--

"For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great mercies will
I gather thee--"

The night shadows fled.Jose still sat at the girl's
bedside, dumb and motionless.Carmen awoke, and threw her arms about
him.But Rosendo appeared and hurried her out to the light morning
repast, for they must lose no time in starting.By ten o'clock the savannas would be too hot to cross, and
they lay some distance from Simiti.Reed and Harris were bustling
about, assembling the packers and cracking jokes as they strapped the
chairs to the men's backs.Dona Maria's eyes were red with weeping,
but she kept silence.Don Jorge
grimly packed his own kit and prepared to set out for the Magdalena,
for he had suddenly announced his determination not to accompany
Rosendo and his party, but to go back and consult with Don Carlos
Norosi in regard to the future.At last Rosendo's voice rang out in a great shout:

"_Ya esta!"_

"Bully-bueno!"The _cargadores_ moved forward in the direction of the Boque trail.The Americans, with a final _adios_ to Dona Maria and the priest,
swung into line behind them.Rosendo again tenderly embraced his
weeping spouse, and then, turned to Jose."The Virgin watch over you and Maria, Padre!If the war comes, flee with her to the Boque."He threw an arm about the priest and kissed him on both cheeks.Then,
calling to Carmen, he turned and started after the others."Padre," she murmured, clinging to him and showering him with kisses,
"I love you, love you, love you!You
will come--or I will come back to you.And I will work for you every
day.I will know that you are God's child, and that you will solve
your problem!"Rosendo, half way down the road, turned and called sharply to her.But again she stopped, turned around, and flew
back to Jose, as he knelt in the dust and, with tongue cleaving to his
mouth, held out his trembling arms."Padre, dearest, dearest Padre," she sobbed, "I love you, I love you!And--I had forgotten--this--it is for you to read every day--every
day!"Again she tore herself
away and ran after the impatient Rosendo.In a moment they were out of
sight.A groan of anguish escaped the stricken priest.He rose from his knees
and followed stumbling after the girl.As he reached the shales he saw
her far in the distance at the mouth of the trail.She turned, and
waved her hand to him.Then the dark trail swallowed her, and he saw
her no more.For a moment he stood like a statue, striving with futile gaze to
penetrate that black opening in the dense bush that had engulfed his
very soul.His hand
closed convulsively over the paper which the girl had left with him.Mechanically he opened it and read:

  "Dearest, dearest Padre, these four little Bible verses I leave
  with you; and you will promise your little girl that you will
  always live by them.Thou shall have no other gods before me.Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in
  heaven is perfect.Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die."And, Padre, my dearest, dearest Padre, _God is everywhere_."His brain reeled, and he swayed like a drunken man.He
turned about, muttering incoherently.Tenderly taking his arm, she led him back to the forlorn little house.Its ghastly emptiness smote him until his reason tottered.He sank
into a chair and gazed with dull, stony eyes out over the placid
lake, where the white beams of the rising sun were breaking into
myriad colors against the brume.CHAPTER 37


The two hundred miles which lay before Rosendo and his little band
stretched their rugged, forbidding length through ragged canons,
rushing waters, and dank, virginal forest.Only the old man, as he
trudged along the worn trail between Simiti and the Inanea river,
where canoes waited to transport the travelers to the little village
of Boque, had any adequate conception of what the journey meant.Even
the _cargadores_ were unfamiliar with the region which they were to
penetrate.Some of them had been over the Guamoco trail as far as
Culata; a few had ascended the Boque river to its farthest navigable
point.But none had penetrated the inmost reaches of the great canon
through which the headwaters tumbled and roared, and none had ever
dreamed of making the passage over the great divide, the _Barra
Principal_, to the Tigui beyond.To the Americans, fresh from the luxury and convention of city life,
and imbued with the indomitable Yankee spirit of adventure, the
prospect was absorbing in its allurements.Especially to the
excitable, high-strung Harris, whose great eyes almost popped from his
head at the continuous display of tropical marvels, and whose
exclamations of astonishment and surprise, enriched from his
inexhaustible store of American slang and miner's parlance, burst from
his gaping mouth at every turn of the sinuous trail.From the outset,
he had constituted himself Carmen's special protector, although
much to Rosendo's consternation, for the lank, awkward fellow, whose
lean shoulders bent under the weight of some six-feet-two of
height, went stumbling and tripping along the way, swaying against
every tree and bush that edged the path, and constantly giving noisy
vent to his opinions regarding trails in general, and those of the
tropics in particular.His only accouterment was a Winchester
rifle of tremendous bore, which he insisted on carrying in constant
readiness to meet either beasts of prey or savage Indians, but
which, in his absent-mindedness and dreamy preoccupation, he
either dragged, muzzle up, or carried at such dangerous angles that
the natives were finally obliged, in self-protection, to insist
that he hand the weapon over to Rosendo.To Carmen, as the days
passed and she gradually recognized his sterling qualities, he
became a source of delight.Hour after hour she trotted along after
him, chatting merrily in her beloved English tongue, poking fun at
his awkwardness, and laughing boisterously over his quaint slang and
naive Yankee expressions.She had never heard such things from Jose;
nor had the priest, despite his profound knowledge, ever told her
such exciting tales as did Harris, when he drew from his store of
frontier memories and  his narratives with the rich tints
furnished by his easy imagination.The first day out had been one of mental struggle for the girl.She
had turned into the trail, after waving a last farewell to Jose, with
a feeling that she had never experienced before.For hours she trudged
along, oblivious of her environment, murmuring, "It isn't true--it
isn't true!"until Harris, his curiosity aroused by the constant
repetition which floated now and then to his ears, demanded to know
what it was that was so radically false."It isn't true that we can be separated," she answered, looking at him
with moist eyes."Yes, God's children--people--people--who--love each other," she
replied.Then she dropped her eyes in evident embarrassment, and
refused to discuss the topic further.ejaculated Harris, pondering the cryptical remark, "you
surely are a queer little dud!"But the girl turned from him to Rosendo.Nor would
she permit the old man to leave her until, late that night, exhausted
by the excitement of the day, she dropped asleep in the house of Don
Nicolas, on the muddy margin of the river Boque, still clinging to
Rosendo's hand.Despite the protestations of Don Nicolas and the pleading of the
_cargadores_, Rosendo stolidly refused to spend a day at Boque.They were still within reach of
the federal authorities.He dared not rest until the jungle had
swallowed them."Ah, _compadre_," said Don Nicolas, in disappointment, "I would like
much for you to enjoy my house while it is still clean.they swarmed down upon us but a day ago.They came out of the bush in millions, straight for the house.had we remained, we should have been eaten alive.But
they swept the house--_Hombre_!no human hands could have done so
well.Every spider, every rat, beetle, flea, every plague, was
instantly eaten, and within a half hour they had disappeared again,
and we moved back into a thoroughly cleaned house!"Harris stood with mouth agape in mute astonishment when Carmen, whom
he had constituted his interpreter, translated to him the story.That evening, after they had eaten out in the open before the house,
and the Americans had tickled the palates of the villagers with some
tinned beef of uncertain quality, Don Nicolas approached Reed."Senor," he said, "my mother, now very aged, is sick, and we think she
can not recover.But you Americanos are wonderfully skilled, and your
medicines powerful.Have you not some remedy in your pack that will
alleviate the good woman's sufferings?Reed knew how great was the faith of these simple people in the wisdom
of the American, and he had reason to wish to preserve it.But he had
come into that country illy prepared to cope with disease, and his
medical equipment contained nothing but quinine.He reflected a
moment, then turned to Harris."Did you smuggle any of your beloved root-beer extract into the
equipment?"Harris looked sheepish, but returned a sullen affirmative."Well," continued Reed, "dig out a bottle and we'll fix up a dose of
pain-killer for our worthy host's mother.""Cierto, senor," he said with an air of
confidence."I have a remedy which I know to be unfailing for any
disease."He disappeared into the house, from which he emerged again in a few
moments with an empty cola bottle.Washing this clean in the river, he
partly filled it with water.Then he poured in the small bottle of
root-beer extract which Harris handed him, and added a few grains of
quinine.Shaking the mixture thoroughly, he carried it to Don
Nicolas."Be very careful, senor," he admonished, giving him the bottle."It is
a medicine extremely powerful and immediate in its action.Give the
senora a small teaspoonful every hour.By morning you will notice a
marked change."Don Nicolas's eyes lighted with joy, and his gratitude poured forth in
extravagant expressions.With the first indications of approaching day Rosendo was abroad,
rounding up his cargadores, who were already bickering as to their
respective duties, and arranging the luggage in the canoes for the
river trip.Additional boats and men had been secured; and Don Nicolas
himself expressed his intention of accompanying them as far as his
hacienda, Maria Rosa, a day's journey up-stream."It was there that I hid during the last revolution," he said, "when
the soldiers burned the village and cut off the ears and fingers of
our women for their rings.Ah, senores, you can not know how we
suffered!All my goods stolen or burned--my family scattered--my
_finca_ destroyed!We lived two years at Maria Rosa, not daring to
come down the river again.His eyes burned fiercely as he spoke, and his hands opened
and closed convulsively.He was a representative of that large class
of _rurales_ upon whom the heaviest burdens, the greatest suffering,
and the most poignant sorrow attending a political revolution always
fall.he exclaimed, suddenly turning to Reed, "I had all but
forgotten!She would see the kind
American whose remedies are so wonderful.For, senor, she rose from
her bed this morning restored!And you must leave us another bottle of
the remedy--at whatever price, senor!"Reed gazed at the man uncomprehendingly, until at length the truth
dawned upon him.His root-beer remedy had done its work!Then a broad
grin mantled his face; but he quickly suppressed it and went with Don
Nicolas to receive in person his patient's effusive thanks.When he
returned and took his place in the waiting boat, he shook his head."It's past all understanding," he muttered to Harris, "what faith will
do!I can believe now that it will remove mountains."Throughout the long, interminably long, hot day the perspiring men
poled and paddled, urged and teased, waded and pushed against the
increasing current, until, as the shadows began to close around them,
they sighted the scarcely visible opening in the bush which marked the
trail to the _hacienda_ of Maria Rosa.It was a desperately lonely
clearing on the verge of the jungle; but there were two thatch-covered
sheds, and to the exhausted travelers it gave assurance of rest and
protection.Before they made the landing Rosendo's sharp eyes had
spied a large ant-eater and her cub, moving sluggishly through the
bush; and Reed's quick shots had brought them both down.The men's
eyes dilated when the animals were dragged into the canoes.It meant
fresh meat instead of salt _bagre_ for at least two days.Early next morning the travelers bade farewell to Don Nicolas and set
their course again up-stream.They would now see no human being other
than the members of their own little party until they reached Llano,
on the distant Nechi."Remember," called Don Nicolas, as the canoes drifted out into the
stream, "the _quebrada_ of Caracoli is the third on the right.An old
trail used to lead from there across to the Tiguicito--but I doubt if
you find even a trace of it now.There is no water between that point
and the Tiguicito._Conque, adios, senores, adios_!"The hallooing of farewells echoed along the river and died away in the
dark forest on either hand.Harris and Reed settled back in their
canoe and yielded to the fascination of the slowly shifting scene.Carmen chose to occupy the same canoe with them, and perforce Rosendo
acted as _patron_.Between his knees
Reed held the rifle upright, in readiness for any animal whose
curiosity might bring it to the water's edge to view the rare pageant
passing through that unbroken solitude.The river was now narrowing, and there were often rapids whose ascent
necessitated disembarking from the canoes, while the _bogas_ strained
and teased the lumbering dugouts up over them.In places the stream
was choked by fallen trees and tangled driftwood, until only a narrow,
tortuous opening was left, through which the waters raced like a
mill-course, making a heavy draft on the intuitive skill of the
_bogas_.Often slender islets rose from the river; and then heated,
chattering, often acrimonious discussions ensued among the men as to
the proper channel to take.Always on either side rose the matted,
tangled, impenetrable forest wall of dense bush and giant trees, from
which innumerable trailers and _bejuco_ vines dropped into the waters
beneath.From the surface of the river to the tops of the great trees,
often two hundred feet above, hung a drapery of creeping plants, of
parasitical growths, and diversified foliage, of the most vivid shades
of green, inextricably laced and interwoven, and dotted here and there
with orchideous flowers and strange blossoms, while in the tempered
sunlight which sifted through it sported gorgeous insects and
butterflies of enormous size and exquisite shades, striped and spotted
in orange, blue, and vivid red.Scarcely a hand's breadth of the
jungle wall but contained some strange, eerie animal or vegetable form
that brought expressions of wonder and astonishment from the
enraptured Americans.At times, too, there were grim tragedies being
enacted before them.In one spot a huge, hairy spider, whose delicate,
lace-like web hung to the water's edge, was viciously wrapping its
silken thread about a tiny bird that had become entangled.Again, a
shriek from beyond the river's margin told of some careless monkey or
small animal that had fallen prey to a hungry jaguar.Above the
travelers all the day swung the ubiquitous buzzards, with their
watchful, speculative eyes ever on the slowly moving cavalcade.If her thought reverted at all to the priest,
she gave no hint of it.But once, leaning back and gazing off into
the opalescent sky overhead, she murmured: "And to think, it is only
the way the human mind translates God's ideas!And some day I shall see those ideas, instead of the mortal mind's
interpretations of them!"Harris heard her, and asked her to repeat her comments in English."You would not understand," she said simply.And no
badinage on his part could further influence her.Rosendo, inscrutable and silent, showed plainly the weight of
responsibility which he felt.Only twice that day did he emerge from
the deep reserve into which he had retired; once when, in the far
distance, his keen eye espied a small deer, drinking at the water's
edge, but which, scenting the travelers, fled into cover ere Reed
could bring the rifle to his shoulders; and again, when they were upon
a jaguar almost before either they or the astonished animal realized
it.In the tempered rays of the late afternoon sun the flower-bespangled
walls of the forest became alive with gaily painted birds and insects.Troops of chattering monkeys awoke from their midday _siesta_ and
scampered noisily through the treetops over the aerial highways
formed by the liana vines, whose great bush-ropes, often a foot and
more in thickness, stretched their winding length long distances
through the forest, and bound the vegetation together in an
intricate, impenetrable network.Yellow and purple blossoms, in a
riot of ineffable splendor, bedecked the lofty trees and tangled
parasitical creepers that wrapped around them, constituting
veritable hanging gardens.Great palms, fattened by the almost
incessant rains in this hot-house of Nature, rose in the spaces
unoccupied by the buttressed roots of the forest giants.Splendidly
tailored kingfishers swooped over the water, scarce a foot above its
surface.Quarreling parrots and nagging macaws screamed their
inarticulate message to the travelers.Tiny forest gems, the
infinitely variegated _colibri_, whirred across the stream and
followed its margins until attracted by the gorgeous pendent flowers.On the _playas_ in the hazy distance ahead the travelers could often
distinguish tall, solemn cranes, dancing their grotesque measures, or
standing on one leg and dreaming away their little hour of life in
this terrestrial fairy-land.Darkness fell, almost with the swiftness of a snuffed candle.For an
hour Rosendo had been straining his eyes toward the right bank of the
river, and as he gazed his apprehension increased.But, as night
closed in, a soft murmur floated down to the cramped, toil-worn
travelers, and the old man, with a glad light in his eyes, announced
that they were approaching the _quebrada_ of Caracoli.A half hour
later, by the weird, flickering light of the candles which Reed and
Harris held out on either side, Rosendo turned the canoe into a
brawling stream, and ran its nose into the deep alluvial soil.Plunging fearlessly through the fringe of delicate ferns which lined
the margin of the creek, he cut a wide swath with his great _machete_
and uncovered a dim trail, which led to a ramshackle, thatch-covered
hut a few yards beyond.It was the tumbled vestige of a shelter which
Don Nicolas had erected years before while hunting wild pigs through
this trackless region.An hour later the little group lay asleep on
the damp ground, wrapped in the solitude of the great forest.The silvery haze of dawn was dimming the stars and deepening into
ruddier hues that tinged the fronds of the mighty trees as with
streaks of blood when Rosendo, like an implacable Nemesis, prodded his
little party into activity.Their first day's march through the
wilderness was to begin, and the old man moved with the nervous,
restless energy of a hunted jaguar.The light breakfast of coffee and
cold _arepa_ over, he dismissed the _bogas_, who were to return to
Boque with the canoes, and set about arranging the cargo in suitable
packs for the _cargadores_ who were to accompany him over the long
reaches of jungle that stretched between them and Llano.Two
_macheteros_ were sent on ahead of the main party to locate and open a
trail.Before the shimmering,
opalescent rays which overspread the eastern sky had begun to turn
downward, the little cavalcade, led by Rosendo, had taken the narrow,
newly-cut trail and plunged into the shadows of the forest--

  "the great, dim, mysterious forest, where uncertainty wavers to an
  interrogation point."CHAPTER 38


The emotion of the jungle is a direct function of human temperament.Where one sees in it naught but a "grim, green sepulcher," teeming with
malignant, destructive forces, inimical to health, to tranquillity, to
life, another--perhaps a member of the same party--will find in the
wanton extravagance of Nature, her prodigious luxury, her infinite
variety of form, of color, and sound, such stimuli to the imagination,
and such invitation to further discovery and development, as to
constitute a lure as insidious and unescapable as the habit which too
often follows the first draft of the opium's fumes.There are those
who profess to have journeyed through vast stretches of South
American _selva_ without encountering a wild animal.Others, with sight
and hearing keener, and with a sense of observation not dulled by
futile lamentations over the absence of the luxuries of civilized
travel, will uncover a wealth of experiences which feed the memory
throughout their remaining years, and mold an irresistible desire to
penetrate again those vast, teeming, baffling solitudes.It is true, the sterner aspect of the South American jungle
affords little invitation to repose or restful contemplation.And
the charm which its riotous prodigality exerts is in no sense
idyllic.For the jungle falls upon one with the force of a blow.It
grips by its massiveness, its awful grandeur.It does not entice
admiration, but exacts obeisance by brute force.Its rest is continuous motion, incessant activity.The
garniture of its trackless wastes is that of great daubs of vivid
color, laid thick upon the canvas with the knife--never modulated,
never worked into delicate shading with the brush, but attracting
by its riot, its audacity, its immensity, its disdain of convention,
its utter disregard of the canons cherished by the puny mind that
contemplates it.The forest's appeal is a reflex of its own infinite
complexity.The sensations which it arouses within the one who steps
from civilization into its very heart are myriad, and often
terrible.The instinct of self-preservation is by it suddenly,
rudely aroused and kept keenly alive.The roar of its howling monkeys strikes terror to the timid heart.The plaintive calls of its persecuted feathered denizens echo through
the mysterious vastnesses like despairing voices from a spirit
world.The crashing noises, the strange, weird, unaccountable
sounds that hurtle through its dimly lighted corridors blanch the
face and cause the hand to steal furtively toward the loosely
sheathed weapon.The piercing, frenzied screams which arise with
blood-curdling effect through the awful stillness of noonday or the
dead of night, turn the startled thought with sickening yearning
toward the soft charms of civilization, in which the sense of
protection is greater, even if actual security is frequently less.Because of Nature's utter disregard of the individual, life is
everywhere.And that life is sharply armed and on the defensive.Their droning murmur crowds the air.The trunks of trees, the
great, pendent leaves of plants, the trailing vines, slimy with dank
vegetation, afford footing and housing to countless myriads of
them, keenly alert, ferociously resistive.The decaying logs fester
with scorpions.The ground is cavernous with the burrows of
lizards and crawling forms, with centipedes and fierce formicidae.Where
one falls, countless others spring up to fill the gap.The rivers
and _pantanos_ yield their quota of variegated forms.The flat
_perania_, the dreaded electric eel, infests the warm streams, and
inflicts its torture without discrimination upon all who dare invade
its domain.Snakes lurk in the fetid swamps and lagoons, the
brilliant coral and the deadly _mapina_.Beneath the forest leaves
coils the brown adder, whose sting proves fatal within three days.To those who see only these aspects of the jungle, a journey such as
that undertaken by Rosendo and his intrepid little band would prove a
terrifying experience, a constant repetition of nerve-shocks, under
which the "centers" must ultimately give way.But to the two
Americans, fresh from the mining camps of the West, and attuned to any
pitch that Nature might strike in her marvelous symphony, the
experience was one to be taken in the same spirit as all else that
pertained to their romantic calling.Rosendo and his men accepted the
day's stint of toil and danger with dull stolidity.Carmen threw
herself upon her thought, and saw in her shifting environment only the
human mind's interpretation of its mixed concept of good and evil.The
insects swarmed around her as around the others.The tantalizing
_jejenes_ urged their insidious attacks upon her, as upon the rest.Her hands were dotted with tiny blood-blisters where the ravenous
gnats had fed.But she uttered no complaint; nor would she discuss the
matter when Harris proffered his sympathy, and showed his own red
hands."It isn't true," she would say."But you have no religion, and you
don't understand--as yet."Well, you have mighty
strange beliefs, young lady!""But not as strange and illogical as those you hold," she replied."Oh, I don't believe anything," he answered, with a shrug of his
shoulders."I'm an agnostic, you know.""There is just where you mistake, Mr."For, instead of not believing anything, you firmly believe in the
presence and power of evil.It is just those very people who boast
that they do not believe in anything who believe most thoroughly in
evil and its omnipotence and omnipresence."Yes, even the animals which she saw about her were but the human
mind's concepts of God's ideas--not real.In the
Bible allegory, or dream, the human, mortal mind names all its own
material concepts.From the rippling Tiguicito,
which they reached choking with thirst and utterly exhausted, they
dropped down again to the Boque, where they established camps and
began to prospect the Molino company's "near-mines," as Harris called
them after the first few unsuccessful attempts to get "colors" out of
the barren soil.At certain points, where there seemed a more likely
prospect, they remained for days, until the men, under Rosendo's
guidance, could sink pits to the underlying bedrock.Such work was
done with the crudest of tools--an iron bar, wooden scrapers in lieu
of shovels, and wooden _bateas_ in which the men handed the loosened
dirt up from one stage to another and out to the surface.It was slow,
torturing work.The food ran low, and they
complained.Then Harris one evening stumbled upon a tapir, just as the great
animal had forded the river and was shambling into the bush
opposite.It fell
with a broken hip, and the men finished it with their _machetes_.Its hide was nearly a half inch in thickness, and covered with
_garrapatas_--fierce, burrowing vermin, with hooked claws, which
came upon the travelers and caused them intense annoyance throughout
the remainder of the journey.Then Reed shot a deer, a delicate, big-eyed creature that had never
seen a human being and was too surprised to flee.Later, Fidel Avila
felled another with a large stone.And, finally, monkeys became so
plentiful that the men all but refused to eat them any longer.Two weeks were spent around the mouth of the Tiguicito and the Boque
canon.The little party
shouldered their packs and began the ascent of the ragged gorge.For
days they clambered up and down the jagged walls of the cut, or
skirted its densely covered margin.Twice Harris fell into the
brawling stream below, and was fished out by Rosendo, his eyes
popping, and his mouth choked with uncomplimentary opinion regarding
mountain travel in the tropics.Once, seizing a slender vine to aid
him in climbing, he gave a sudden lurch and swung out unexpectedly
over the gorge, hundreds of feet deep.Again Rosendo, who by this time
had learned to keep one eye on the ground and the other on the
irresponsible Harris, rescued him from his perilous position."Why don't you watch where you are going?""I might," sputtered Harris, "if I could keep my eyes off of you."Whereat Carmen pursed her lips and told him to reserve his compliments
for those who knew how to appraise them rightly.They camped where night overtook them, out in the open, often falling
asleep without waiting to build a fire, but eating soggy corn _arepa_
and tinned food, and drinking cold coffee left from the early morning
repast.But sometimes, when the fatigue of day was less, they would
gather about their little fire, chilled and dripping, and beg Carmen
to sing to them while they prepared supper.Then her clear voice would
ring out over the great canon and into the vast solitudes on either
hand in strange, vivid contrast to the cries and weird sounds of the
jungle; and the two Americans would sit and look at her as if they
half believed her a creature from another world.Sometimes Harris
would draw her into conversation on topics pertaining to philosophy
and religion, for he had early seen her bent and, agnostic that he
was, delighted to hear her express her views, which to him were so
childishly impossible.But as often he would voluntarily retire from
the conflict, sometimes shaking his head dubiously, sometimes
muttering his impatience with a mere child whose logic he, despite his
collegiate training, could not refute.He was as full of philosophical
theories as a nut with meat; but when she asked for proofs, for less
human belief and more demonstration, he hoisted the white flag and
retired from the field.But his admiration for the child became
sincere.And by the time
they had reached the great divide through which the Rosario fell, he
was dimly aware of a feeling toward the beautiful creature who walked
at his side day after day, sharing without complaint hardship and
fatigue that sorely taxed his own endurance, that was something more
than mere regard, and he had begun to speculate vaguely on a possible
future in which she became the central figure.At Rosario creek they left the great canon and turned into the rugged
defile which wound its tortuous course upward into the heights of the
_Barra Principal_.They were now in a region where, in Rosendo's
belief, there was not one human being in an area of a hundred square
miles.He himself was in sore doubt as to the identity of the
_quebrada_ which they were following.But it tallied with the brief
description given him by Don Nicolas.And, moreover, which was even
more important, as they began its ascent there came to him that sense
of conviction which every true son of the jungle feels when he is
following the right course.He might not say how he knew he was right;
but he followed the leading without further question.Up over the steep talus at the base of the canon wall they clambered,
up into the narrowing _arroyo_, cutting every foot of the way, for the
_macheteros_ were now no longer keeping ahead of them--the common
danger held the band united.Often they believed they discovered
traces of ancient trails.But the jealous forest had all but
obliterated them, and they could not be certain.In the higher and
drier parts of the forest, where they left the creek and followed
the beds of dead streams, slender ditches through which the water
raced in torrents during the wet season, they were set upon by
countless swarms of bees, a strange, stingless variety that covered
them in a buzzing, crawling mass, struggling and fighting for the
salt in the perspiration which exuded from the human bodies.Harris
swore he would cease to eat, for he could not take even a mouthful
of food without at the same time taking in a multitude of bees.Often, too, their _machetes_ cut into great hornet nests.Then, with
the shrill cry, "_Avispas_!"Rosendo would tear recklessly through
the matted jungle, followed by his slapping, stumbling companions,
until the maddened insects gave up the chase.Frequently they
walked into huge ant nests before they realized it, sometimes the
great _tucanderas_, so ferociously poisonous."Ah, senores,"
commented Rosendo, as he once stopped to point out the marvelous
roadway cut by these insects for miles straight through the jungle,
"in the days of the Spaniards the cruel taskmasters would often tie
the weak and sick slaves to trees in the depths of the forest and
let these great ants devour them alive!Senores, you can never know
the terrible crimes committed by the Spaniards!"murmured Harris, eying Carmen furtively.But she knew, though she voiced it not, that the Spaniard had never
known the Christ.Night was spent on the summit of the divide.Then, without further
respite, Rosendo urged the descent.Down through ravines and gullies;
over monster bowlders; waist deep through streams; down the sheer
sides of gorges on natural ladders formed by the hanging _mora_
vines; skirting cliffs by the aid of tangled and interlaced roots
of rank, wet vegetation; and then down again into river bottoms,
where the tenacious mud challenged their every step, and the streams
became an interminable morass, through which passage was possible
only by jumping from root to root, where the gnarled feeders of the
great trees projected above the bottomless ooze.The persecution
of the _jejenes_ became diabolical.At dawn and sunset the raucous
bellow of the red-roarer monkeys made the air hideous.The
flickering lights of the forest became dismally depressing.The men
grew morose and sullen.Reed and Harris quarreled with each other on
the slightest provocation.Then, to increase their misery, came the rain.It fell upon them in
the river bottoms in fierce, driving gusts; then in sheets that
blotted out the forest and wet their very souls.The mountains roared and trembled with the hideous
cannonade of thunder.The jungle-matted hills ran with the flood.An
unvaried pall of vapor hung over the steaming ground, through which
uncanny, phantasmagoric shapes peered at the struggling little band.Again the sun burst forth, and a fiery vapor seethed above the moist
earth.The reek of their damp clothing and the acrid odor of the wet
soil increased the enervation of their hard travel.Again and again
the peevish Harris accused Rosendo of having lost the way.The old man
patiently bore the abuse.Reed chided Harris, and at length quarreled
violently with him, although his own apprehension waxed continually
greater.Hour after hour she toiled along,
floundering through the bogs, fording the deeper streams on Rosendo's
broad back, whispering softly to him at times, often seizing and
pressing his great horny hand, but holding her peace.In vain at
evening, when gathered about the damp, smudging firewood, Harris would
bring up to her the causes of her flight.In vain he would accuse the
unfortunate Alcalde, the Bishop, the soldiers.Carmen refused to lend
ear to it, or to see in it anything more than a varied expression of
the human mind.She
saw, not persons, not things, but expressions of thought in the
phenomena which had combined to urge her out of her former environment
and cast her into the trackless jungle.At length, one day, when it seemed to the exhausted travelers that
human endurance could stand no more, Rosendo, who had long been
straining his ears in the direction straight ahead, announced that the
singing noise which floated to them as they descended a low hill and
plunged into a thicket of tall lush grass, undoubtedly came from the
river Tigui.Another hour of straining and plunging through the dense
growth followed; and then, with a final effort, which manifested in a
sort of frenzied rush, the little band emerged suddenly upon the east
bank of the crystal stream, glittering and shimmering in the bright
morning sun as it sang and rippled on its solitary way through the
great jungle.The men threw off their packs and sprawled full length upon the
ground."La Colorado," he said, indicating what the Americans at length made
out to be a frame house, looming above the high grass."And there,"
pointing to the north, "is _Pozo Cayman_, where the trail begins that
leads to La Libertad."That night, as they lay on the rough board floor of the house at La
Colorado, Rosendo told them the story of the misguided Frenchmen who,
years before, had penetrated this wild region, located a barren quartz
vein, then floated a company and begun developments.The soil was fertile; the undeveloped country
ceaselessly rich in every resource, the water pure and sparkling, and
abounding in fish.The climate, too, was moderate and agreeable.It
seemed to the foreigners a terrestrial paradise.It crept out of the jungle like a thief in the night.One by one the Frenchmen fell sick and died.He remained to protect the
company's property.But he, too, fell a victim to the plague.One day,
as he lay burning upon his bed, he called feebly to his one remaining
servant, the native cook, to bring him the little package of quinine.She hastened to comply; but, alas!she brought the packet of
strychnine instead, and soon he, too, had joined his companions in
that unknown country which awaits us all.The old woman fled in
terror; and the evil spirits descended upon the place.They haunt it
yet, and no man approaches it but with trembling.Reed and Harris listened to the weird story with strange sensations.The clouds above had broken, and the late moon streamed through the
night vapor, and poured through the bamboo walls of the house.The
giant frogs in the nearby creek awoke, and through the long night
croaked their mournful plaint in a weird minor cadence that seemed to
the awed Americans to voice to the shimmering moon the countless
wrongs of the primitive Indians, who, centuries before, had roamed
this marvelous land in happy freedom, until the Spaniard descended
like a dark cloud and, with rack and stake, fastened his blighting
religion upon them.A day's rest at La Colorado sufficed to revive the spirits of the
party and prepare them for the additional eight or ten hour journey
over boggy morass and steep hill to La Libertad.For this trip Rosendo
would take only the Americans and Carmen.The _cargadores_ were not to
know the nature of this expedition, which, Rosendo announced, was
undertaken that the Americans might explore for two days the region
around the upper Tigui.The men received this explanation with grunts
of satisfaction.Trembling with suppressed excitement, oblivious now of fatigue,
hunger, or hardship, Reed and Harris followed the old man that day
over the ancient, obliterated trail to the forgotten mine of Don
Ignacio de Rincon.They experienced all the sensations of those who
find themselves at last on the course that leads to buried treasure.To Harris, the romance attaching to the expedition obliterated all
other considerations.But Reed was busy with the practical end of it,
with costs, with the problems of supplies, of transportation, and
trail.Carmen saw but one vision, the man in far-off Simiti, whose
ancestor once owned the great mine which lay just ahead of them.When night fell, the four stood, silent and wondering, at the mouth of
the crumbling tunnel, where lay a rusted shovel bearing the scarce
distinguishable inscription, "I de R."*       *       *       *       *

Two weeks later a group of natives, sitting at a feast of baked
alligator tail, at the mouth of the Amaceri, near the dirty,
straggling riverine town of Llano, rose in astonishment as they saw
issuing from the clayey, wallowing Guamoco trail a staggering band of
travelers, among them two foreigners, whose clothes were in shreds and
whose beards and unkempt hair were caked with yellow mud.With them
came a young girl, lightly clad and wearing torn rope _alpargates_ on
her bare feet.From the
neighboring town floated a brawling bedlam of human voices.It was
Sunday, and the villagers were celebrating a religious _fiesta_."_Compadres_," said Rosendo, approaching the half-intoxicated group.One of the group, his mouth too full to speak, pointed in expressive
pantomime up-stream.Rosendo murmured a fervent "_Loado sea Dios_,"
and sank upon the ground."It will be down to-morrow--to-day, perhaps," gurgled another of the
rapidly recovering feasters, his eyes roving from one member to
another of the weird-looking little band.exclaimed Harris, as he squatted upon the damp ground
and mopped his muddy brow."I'm a salamander for heat, that's
certain!""Senor," said Rosendo, addressing Reed, "it would be well to pay the
men at once, for the boat may appear at any time, and it will not wait
long."While the curious group from the village crowded about and eagerly
watched the proceedings, Reed unstrapped his pack and drew out a bundle
of Colombian bills, with which he began to pay the _cargadores_,
according to the reckoning which Rosendo had kept.As the last man,
with a grunt of satisfaction, received his money, Harris exclaimed:
"And to think, one good American dollar is worth a bushel of that paper
stuff!"The words were scarcely out of his mouth when a shrill whistle came
echoing down the river.A cloud of smoke above the distant treetops
heralded the approach of the steamer.The little party had escaped a
wait of a month in the drenching heat of Llano by the narrow margin of
an hour.Rosendo hastened to Reed and drew him aside.He tried to speak, but
words failed him."I understand, my friend," he
said gently.My wife
and I will care for the girl until we hear from you.And we will keep
in touch with you, although it will take two months for a letter to
reach us and our reply to get back again to Simiti.The development
company will be formed at once.Within six months you may expect to
see the work started.It is your fortune--and the girl's.""Padre, I am coming back to you--yes?""_Cierto, chiquita_!"The old man would not permit himself to say
more.The girl had known for some time that he was not to accompany
her to the States, and that she should not see Ana in Cartagena.To
this she had at length accustomed herself.In a few minutes the lumbering boat had swung around and thrown out
its gang plank.A hurried embrace; a struggle with rushing tears;
another shriek from the boat whistle; and the Americans, with Carmen
standing mute and motionless between them, looked back at the fading
group on shore, where Rosendo's tall figure stood silhouetted
against the green background of the forest.For a moment he held his
arm extended toward them.Carmen knew, as she looked at the
great-hearted man for the last time, that his benediction was
following her--following her into that new world into which he might
not enter.*       *       *       *       *

Reed lifted the silent, wondering, big-eyed girl from the dinkey
train which pulled into Cartagena from Calamar ten days later, and
took her to the Hotel Mariana, where his anxious, fretting wife
awaited.Their boat had hung on a hidden bar in the Cauca river
for four interminable, torturing days.CHAPTER 39


On the day that Carmen arrived in Cartagena, Rosendo staggered down
the Guamoco trail into Simiti.On that same momentous day the flames
of war again flared up throughout the country.The Simiti episode, in
which the President had interfered, brought Congress to the necessity
of action.A few days of fiery debate followed; then the noxious
measure was taken from the table and hastily enacted into a law.But news travels slowly in Latin America, and some time was required
for this act of Congress to become generally known.The delay saw
Carmen through the jungle and down to the coast.There Reed lost no
time in transacting what business still remained for him in Cartagena,
and securing transportation for his party to New York.Jose, the shadow of his former self, clung pitiably to Rosendo's hand,
imploring the constant repetition of the old man's narrative.Then
came Juan, flying to the door.He had seen and talked with the
returned _cargadores_.Neither Jose nor Rosendo could
calm him.At length it seemed wise to them both to tell him that she
had gone to the States with the Americans, and would return to Simiti
no more.He gathered groups of companions about him and talked to them
excitedly.Then, evidently acting on
the advice of some cooler head, he rushed to his canoe and put off
across the lake toward the _cano_.But when he did, the town knew that he had been to Bodega Central, and
that the country was aflame with war.*       *       *       *       *

Reed's wife had not received Carmen in an amiable frame of mind."For
heaven's sake, Charles," she had cried, turning from his embrace to
look at the wondering girl who stood behind him, "what have you
here?""Oh, that," he laughingly replied, "is only a little Indian I lassoed
back in the jungle."And, leaving the girl to the not very tender
graces of his wife, he hurried out to arrange for the return voyage.At noon, when Harris appeared at Reed's room, Carmen rushed to him and
begged to be taken for a stroll through the town.Yielding to her
husband's insistence, Mrs.Reed had outfitted the girl, so that she
presented a more civilized appearance.At first Carmen had been
delighted with her new clothes.They were such, cheap as they were, as
she had never seen in Simiti.But the shoes--"Ah, senora," she
pleaded, "do not make me wear them, they are so tight!She was beginning her education in the conventions
and trammels of civilization.As Carmen and Harris stood that afternoon in the public square, while
the girl gazed enraptured at an equestrian statue of Simon Bolivar, a
ragged little urchin approached and begged them to buy an afternoon
paper.Harris humored him and bade Carmen ask him his name."Rincon," the lad answered, drawing himself up proudly."In the Calle Lozano," he replied, wondering why these people seemed
interested in him."Ask him who his father
is," suggested the latter."I do not know," replied the little fellow, shaking his head.He lives far away, up the great river, so Tia Catalina says."Come with me to your home,"
she said, taking his hand.The boy led them willingly through the winding streets to the little
upper room where, years before, he had first seen the light."Tia Catalina," he cried to the shabby woman who rose in amazement as
the visitors entered, "see, some strangers!"Carmen lost no time, but went at once to the heart of her question."The little fellow's father--he is a Rincon?And--he lives up the
great river?"The woman eyed her suspiciously for some moments without replying."Yes, senorita," he said eagerly, "in
Simiti.And his name--I am named for him--it is Jose.And I am going
to visit him some day.Tia Catalina said I should, no, Tia?"Harris fumbled in his pocket and drew out some money, which he handed
to the woman.Her eyes lighted, and a cavernous smile spread over her
wrinkled face."_Ah, gracias, senor_," she murmured, bending over his hand; "we need
it.The boy's father has sent us but little of late."Carmen's heart was fluttering wildly."Tell me," she said in a cold
voice, "the boy's father is Padre Jose de Rincon, of Simiti?We have just come from Simiti, and have seen him.We are leaving to-morrow for the States.""Yes, senorita," replied the woman in a thin, cracking voice, now
completely disarmed of her suspicion."The little fellow was born here
some seven years ago.But the good Padre has sent
us money ever since to care for him, until of late.Senorita, why is
it, think you, that he sends us so little now?""I--do--not--know," murmured Carmen abstractedly, scarce hearing the
woman.She bent over him and looked long
and wistfully into his eyes.He was a bright, handsome little fellow;
and though her heart was crushed, she took him into it.Swallowing the
lump which had come into her throat, she drew him to the window and
sat down, holding him before her."Your father--I know him--well.But--I did not
know--I never knew that he had a son.""Tia Catalina says he is a fine man," proudly answered the boy."And she wants me to be a priest, too.But I am going to be a
bull-fighter.""It is true, senorita," interposed the woman."We cannot keep him
from the _arena_ now.He hangs about it all day, and about the
slaughter-house.We can hardly drag him back to his meals.What
can we do, senorita?But," with a touch of pride as she looked at him,
"if he becomes a bull-fighter, he will be the best of them all!"Her question carried an appeal which
came from the depths of her soul."Senora, is there no doubt--no doubt
that Padre Rincon is the father of the boy?"The lad's mother died in the good Padre's
arms.She would not say positively who was the boy's father.We
thought at first--it was some one else.Marcelena insisted on it to
her dying day.But now--now we know that it was Padre Jose.And he was
sent to Simiti for it.But--ah, senorita, the little mother was so
beautiful, and so good!She--but, senorita, you are not leaving so
soon?""Yes, my good senora," she said wearily."We must
now return to the hotel.But--here is more money for the boy.And,
senora, when I reach the States I will send you money every month for
him.""Come," she said simply, "I have seen enough
of the city."*       *       *       *       *

At noon the next day a message from Bodega Central was put into the
hand of the acting-Bishop of Cartagena, as he sat in his study,
wrapped in the contemplation of certain papers before him.Hostilities
had begun along the Magdalena river the day before.The gates of
Cartagena were to be barricaded that day, for a boatload of rebels was
about to leave Barranquilla to storm the city and seize, if possible,
the customs.When he had read the message he uttered an exclamation.Had not the Sister Superior of the Convent of Our Lady reported the
arrival of the daughter of Rosendo Ariza some days before?He seized
his hat and left the room.Hastening to the Department of Police, he had a short interview with
the chief.Then that official despatched policemen to the office of
the steamship company, and to the dock.Their orders were to arrest
two Americans who were abducting a young girl.They returned a half
hour later with sheepish faces."Your Excellency," they announced to
their chief, "the vessel sailed from the port an hour ago, with the
Americans and the girl aboard."The announcement aroused in Wenceslas the fury of a tiger.Exacerbation
succeeded surprise; and that in turn gave way to a maddening thirst for
sanguinary vengeance.He hastened out and despatched a telegraphic
message to Bogota.Then he returned to his study to await its effect.Two days later a river steamer, impressed by the federal authorities,
stopped at the mouth of the Boque, and a squad of soldiers marched
over the unfrequented trail to Simiti, where they arrived as night
fell.Their orders were to take into custody the priest, Jose de
Rincon, who was accused of complicity in the recent plot to overthrow
the existing government.At the same time, on a vessel plowing its way into the North, a young
girl, awkwardly wearing her ill-fitting garments, hung over the rail
and gazed wistfully back at the Southern Cross.The tourists who saw
her heterogeneous attire laughed.But when they looked into her
beautiful, sad face their mirth died, and a tender pity stirred their
hearts.CARMEN ARIZA

CARMEN ARIZA

CHAPTER 1


The blanket of wet fog which had hung over the harbor with such
exasperating tenacity lifted suddenly, late in the raw fall afternoon,
and revealed to the wondering eyes of the girl who stood alone at the
rail of the _Joachim_ a confusion of mountainous shadows, studded with
myriad points of light which glittered and shimmered beneath the gray
pall.Across the heaving waters came the dull, ominous breathing of
the metropolis.Clouds of heavy, black smoke wreathed about the bay.Through it shrieking water craft darted and wriggled in endless
confusion.For two days the port of New York had been a bedlam of raw
sound, as the great sirens of the motionless vessels roared their
raucous warnings through the impenetrable veil which enveloped them.Their noise had become acute torture to the impatient tourists, and
added bewilderment to the girl.The transition from the primitive simplicity of her tropical home had
not been one of easy gradation, but a precipitate plunge.The
convulsion which ensued from the culmination of events long gathering
about little Simiti had hurled her through the forest, down the
scalding river, and out upon the tossing ocean with such swiftness
that, as she now stood at the portal of a new world, she seemed to be
wandering through the mazes of an intricate dream.During the ocean
voyage she had kept aloof from the other passengers, partly because of
embarrassment, partly because of the dull pain at her heart as she
gazed, day after day, at the two visions which floated always before
her: one, the haggard face of the priest, when she tore herself from
his arms in far-off Simiti; the other, that of the dark-faced,
white-haired old man who stood on the clayey river bank at wretched
Llano and watched her, with eager, straining eyes, until the winding
stream hid her from his earthly sight--forever.She wondered dully now
why she had left them, why she had so easily yielded to the influences
which had caused the separation.They might have fled to the jungle
and lived there in safety and seclusion.The malign influences which
beset them all in Simiti never could have reached them in the
trackless forest.And yet, she knew that had not Rosendo and Jose held
out to her, almost to the last moment, assurances of a speedy reunion,
she would not have yielded to the pressure which they had exerted, and
to the allurements of life in the wonderful country to which they had
sent her.Her embarrassment on the boat was due largely to a sense of
awkwardness in the presence of women who, to her provincial sight,
seemed visions of beauty.To be sure, the priest had often shown her
pictures of the women of the outside world, and she had some idea of
their dress.But that such a vast difference existed between the
illustrations and the actualities, she had never for a moment
imagined.Their gowns, their jewels, their coiffures held her in
open-mouthed marvel, until Mrs.Reed, herself annoyed and embarrassed,
remanded her to her cabin and bade her learn the impropriety of such
manners.Nor had the conduct of this lady throughout the voyage conduced to
Carmen's happiness.Reed showed plainly that the girl was an
awkward embarrassment to her; that she was tolerated because of
reasons which pertained solely to her husband's business; and she took
pains to impress upon her fellow-travelers that, in view of the
perplexing servant problem, this unmannered creature was being taken
to the States to be trained as a maid, though, heaven knew!the
training would be arduous, and the result uncertain.Reed, though measurably kind, gave Carmen scant attention.Harris
alone saved the girl from almost complete neglect.He walked the deck
with her, regardless of the smiles of the other passengers.He taught
her to play shuffle-board, checkers, and simple card games.He
conducted her over the boat and explained the intricate machinery and
the numberless wonders of the great craft.He sat with her out on the
deck at night and told her marvelous stories of his experiences in
frontier camps.And at the table he insisted that she occupy the seat
next to him, despite the protestations of the chief steward, who would
have placed her apart with the servants.Carmen said little, but she clung to the man with an appeal which,
though mute, he nevertheless understood.At Kingston he took her on a
drive through the town, and bought post cards for her to send back to
Jose and Rosendo.It consoled her immeasurably when he glowingly
recounted the pleasure her loved ones would experience on receiving
these cards; and thereafter the girl daily devoted hours to the
preparation of additional ones to be posted in New York.The lifting of the fog was the signal for a race among the stalled
craft to gain the harbor entrance.The enforced retention of the
vessels in the bay had resulted in much confusion in docking, and the
_Joachim_ was assigned to a pier not her own.The captain grumbled,
but had no choice.At the pier opposite there docked a huge liner from
Havre; and the two boats poured their swarming human freight into the
same shed.When the gang plank dropped, Harris took charge of Carmen,
while Reed and his wife preceded them ashore, the latter giving a
little scream of delight as she spied her sister and some friends with
a profusion of flowers awaiting her on the pier.She rushed joyfully
into their arms, while Reed hastened to his equipage with a customs
officer.But as Harris and the bewildered Carmen pushed into the great crowd in
the shed, the absent-minded man suddenly remembered that he had left a
bundle of Panama hats underneath his bunk.Dropping the girl's hand,
the impetuous fellow tore back up the gang plank and dived into the
boat.For a moment Carmen, stood in confusion, bracing herself against
the swarming multitude, and clinging tenaciously to the small,
paper-wrapped bundle which she carried.But the eager, belated crowd almost swept her off her
feet, and she turned again, drifting slowly with it toward the
distant exit.As she moved uncertainly, struggling the while to
prevent being crushed against the wall, she felt some one grasp her
hand.sounded a gentle voice close to her ear.Come, they are waiting for
us up ahead."It was a woman, comely of feature,
and strikingly well dressed.The
anxious fears of a moment before vanished.Reed and the others are waiting for us.The automobiles came for you all; but I presume the
others have gone by this time.However, you and I will follow in mine.the girl asked eagerly, as the woman forced a way for them
through the mass of humanity."Did he write to you--from Simiti?"He said
your name was--"

"Carmen," interrupted the girl, with a great surge of gladness, for
here was one woman who did not avoid her.cried Carmen, suddenly stopping as she remembered.He knows where to find the
automobiles.I will leave word with the pier-master to tell him."By this time they had wormed their way clear of the crowd and gained
the street.The woman, still retaining Carmen's hand, went directly to
a waiting automobile and pushed the unresisting girl through the open
door.Carmen had never seen a conveyance like this, and her thought
was instantly absorbed.And
then, sinking into the luxurious cushions, she fell to speculating as
to how the thing was moved.As the chauffeur reached back to close the door a policeman, who had
been eying the party since they came out of the shed, stepped up and
laid a hand on the car."Er--little girl," he said, looking in and addressing Carmen,
"_you--you know this lady, do you_?""Yes," replied Carmen, looking up confidently into the woman's smiling
face.She thought his blue uniform
and shining buttons and star gorgeously beautiful.Suspicion lurked in his eyes as
he looked at the woman and then back again at the girl."She is a little girl who came up from the South with my nephew, Mr.I
will give you my card, if you wish."The chauffeur, too, as he got out and
leisurely examined his engine, served further to disarm suspicion.The
officer raised up and removed his hand from the machine.The chauffeur
slowly mounted the box and threw on his lever.As the car moved gently
into the night the officer glanced at its number.What's a fellow going to do in a case like this, I'd like to know--go
with 'em?"Some minutes later, Harris, wild and disheveled, followed by Reed and
his party, emerged hurriedly into the street.asked the officer, planting himself in front
of Harris, and becoming vaguely apprehensive.sputtered Harris, his eyes protruding and his long arms pawing
the air."Girl--so high--funny dress--big straw hat!Aunt took her just now in an auto!"For a moment they all stood silent, big-eyed and gaping.The
girl came up from South America with me.Describe the woman--"

"Reed!"cried the policeman excitedly, his eyes lighting.cried the distracted Harris,
menacing the confused officer.Night had fallen, and a curious crowd was gathering around the
excited, noisy group.Reed quickly signaled a taxicab and hustled the
bewildered officer into it."You, Harris, get the women folks home,
and wait for me!I'll go to central with this officer and report the
case!""I'm going to visit every dance hall
and dive in this bloomin' town before I go home!And you, you blithering idiot," shaking a fist at the
officer, "you're going to lose your star for this!"Meantime, the car, in which Carmen lay deep in the soft cushions, sped
through the dusk like a fell spirit.A confused jumble of shadows flew
past, and strange, unfamiliar noises rose from the animated streets.The lights shimmered on the moist glass.The girl
ceased trying to read any meaning in it.It all fused into a blur; and
she closed her eyes and gave herself up to the novel sensations
stimulated by her first ride in a carriage propelled--she knew not
how.At length came a creaking, a soft, skidding motion, and the big car
rolled up against a curb and stopped."We are home now," said the woman softly, as she descended and again
took Carmen's hand.They hurriedly mounted the white stone steps of a
tall, gloomy building and entered a door that seemed to open
noiselessly at their approach.A glare of light burst upon the
blinking eyes of the girl.A <DW64> woman softly closed the door after
them.With a wondering glance, Carmen looked about her.In the room at
her right she caught a glimpse of women--beautiful, they seemed to
her--clad in loose, low-cut, gaily  gowns.There were men
there, too; and some one sat at a piano playing sprightly music.She
had seen pianos like that in Cartagena, and on the boat, and they had
seemed to her things bewitched.In the room at the end of the hall men
and women were dancing on a floor that seemed of polished glass.Loud
talk, laughter, and singing floated through the rooms, and the air
was warm and stuffy, heavy with perfume.The odor reminded her of the
roses in her own little garden in Simiti.It was all beautiful,
wonderful, fairy-like.But she had only a moment for this appraisal.Seizing her hand again,
the woman whisked her up the flight of stairs before them and into a
warm, light room.Then, without speaking, she went out and closed the
door, leaving the girl alone.Carmen sank into a great, upholstered rocking chair and tried to grasp
it all as she swayed dreamily back and forth.She
wondered if Harris dwelt in a place of such heavenly beauty; for he
had said that he did not live with Reed.What would the stupid people
of Simiti think could they see her now!She had never dreamed that
such marvels existed in the big world beyond her dreary, dusty, little
home town!Jose had told her much, ah, wonderful things!But how pitifully inadequate now seemed all their stories!She
still wondered what had made that carriage go in which she had come up
from the boat.Would her interest in
La Libertad suffice to buy one?She passed her hand over
the clean, white counterpane of the bed."Oh," she murmured, "how
beautiful!"She went dreamily to the bureau and took up, one by one,
the toilet articles that lay there in neat array.she
murmured, again and again.The
little figure reflected there contrasted so oddly with the gorgeously
beautiful ones she had glimpsed below that she laughed aloud.Then she
went to the window and felt of the soft curtains."It is heaven," she
murmured, facing about and sweeping the room, "just heaven!Oh, how
beautiful even the human mind can be!I never thought it, I never
thought it!"Again she sat down in the big rocker and gave herself up to the charm
of her surroundings.Her glance fell upon a vase of flowers that stood
on a table near another window.She rose and went to them, bending
over to inhale their fragrance.she exclaimed, as she
felt them crackle in her fingers.But she would learn, ere long, that they fittingly symbolized the life
of the great city in which she was now adrift.She began to wonder why the woman did not return.Were
not the Reeds anxious to know of her safe arrival?It was a ball--but so
different from the simple, artless _baile_ of her native town.Stray
snatches of music drifted into the room from the piano below.She went to the door, thinking to open
it a little and listen.She went hastily, instinctively, to a window and raised the
curtain.She remembered suddenly
that prison windows were like that.Terror's clammy hand gripped at her heart.Then she
caught herself--and laughed.she exclaimed, sinking again
into the rocker.At that moment the door opened noiselessly and a woman entered.She
was younger than the one who had met the boat.When she saw the girl
she uttered an exclamation.Carmen glanced down at her odd attire and then smiled up at the woman.The woman laughed, a sharp, unmusical laugh.The dry cosmetic
plastered thick upon her cheeks cracked.She was not beautiful like
the others, thought Carmen.Her cheeks were sunken, and her low-cut
gown revealed great, protruding collarbones."Come," she said
abruptly, "get out of those rags and into something modern."She
opened a closet door and selected a gown from a number hanging there.It was white, and there was a gay ribbon at the waist."It'll have to be pinned up," she commented to herself, holding it out
before her and regarding Carmen critically.she exclaimed, "am I to wear that?The woman returned no answer, but opened a bureau drawer and took from
it several other garments, which she threw upon a chair, together with
the dress."Into the whole lot of 'em," she said sharply, indicating the
garments."And move lively, for supper's waitin' and there'll be
callers soon--gentlemen callers," she added, smiling grimly.The woman stopped
abruptly and stood with arms akimbo, regarding the girl.Carmen gazed
up at her with a smile of happy, trustful assurance.She mentioned Simiti, Padre Jose, and Rosendo.Her
voice quavered a little; but she brightened up and concluded: "And Mr.Reed's Auntie, she met us--that is, me.Oh, isn't she a beautiful
lady!"The woman seemed to be fascinated by the child's gaze.Then, suddenly,
as if something had given way under great strain, she cried: "For
God's sake, don't look at me that way!She dropped into
a chair and continued to stare at the girl."Well, I've told you," replied Carmen."But," she continued, going
quickly to the woman and taking her hand, "you haven't told me your
name yet.And we are going to be such good friends, aren't we?And you are going to tell me all about this beautiful house, and
that wonderful carriage I came here in.Reed will take me out in it every
day!"Then, in a low voice:

"Your mother--is she living?""But my mother, my own real mother,
she died, long, long ago, on the banks of the great river.My father
left her, and she was trying to follow him.Then I was born--"

"The same old story!""I've been there,
girl, and know all about it.I followed the man--but it was my kid
that died!God, if I could have laid my hands on him!And now you have
come here--"

She stopped abruptly and swallowed hard.Carmen gently stole an arm
about her neck."It isn't true," she murmured, laying her soft cheek
against the woman's painted one."No one can desert us or harm us, for
_God is everywhere_.Padre Jose said I had a message for the people up here; and now you
are the first one I've told it to.And if we know that, why, nothing bad can ever happen to us.But you
didn't know it when your husband left you, did you?"Then she looked up into the girl's
deep, wondering eyes and checked herself."Come," she said abruptly,
rising and still holding her hand."We'll go down to supper now as you
are."Carmen's companion led her down the stairs and through the hall to a
brightly lighted room at the rear, where about a long table sat a half
dozen women.There were places for as many more, but they were
unoccupied.The cloth was white, the glass shone, the silver
sparkled.And the women, who glanced up at the girl, were clad in
gowns of such gorgeous hues as to make the child gasp in amazement.Over all hung the warm, perfumed air that she had thought so delicious
when she had first entered the house.The woman led her to a chair next to
the one she herself took.Carmen looked around for the lady who had
met her at the boat.The silence and the steady
scrutiny of the others began to embarrass her."Where--where is
Auntie?"she asked timidly, looking up at her faded attendant.One of the women, who swayed slightly
in her chair, looked up stupidly.A burst of laughter followed this remark, and Carmen sat down
in confusion.asked one of the younger women of Carmen's
attendant.Headache," was the laconic reply."She landed a queen this time, didn't she?"looking admiringly at
Carmen."Gets me, how the old girl does it!"Carmen," replied the girl timidly, looking questioningly about the
room."Carmen Ariza," the child amended, as her big, wondering eyes swept
the group."Where do you hail from,
angel-face?"The girl looked uncomprehendingly at her interlocutor."Tell them where you lived, child," said the woman called Jude in a
low voice."Simiti," replied Carmen, tears choking her words.A
burst of mirth punctuated the question."Long way from Paris, judging by the fashions."Carmen answered in a scarcely audible voice, "South America."Low exclamations of astonishment encircled the table, while the women
sat regarding the girl curiously."But," continued Carmen in a trembling voice, "where is Mrs.Her beautiful face wore
such an expression of mingled fear, uncertainty, and helplessness as
to throw a hush upon the room.she
muttered, "it's a shame!"She looked for a moment uncertainly into the
big, deep eyes of the girl, and then turned and hastily left the
room.The silence which followed was broken by a pallid, painted creature at
the end of the table."What an old devil the Madam is!One look into those eyes
would have been enough for me!""This is only a recruiting
station for the regular army.She'll go over to French Lucy's; and the
Madam will get a round price for the job.""Old Lucy'll get rich off of her!Ames owns
her house, too, doesn't he?"replied Jude, brightening under the stimulus of her
wine."He owns every house in this block, they say.The Madam rolls on the
floor and cusses for a week straight every time she pays hers.But
just the same, if you've ever noticed, the houses that Ames owns are
never raided by the coppers.Ames whacks up with the mayor and the
city hall gang and the chief of police.That means protection, and we
pay for it in high rents.But it's a lot better'n being swooped down
on by the cops every few weeks, ain't it?We know what we're expected
to pay, that way.And we never do when we keep handin' it out to the
cops."And he's got a new
collector, fellow from the Ketchim Realty Company.They're the old
man's agents now for his dive-houses.He can't get anybody else to
handle 'em, so the collector tells me.""Belle Carey's place was pulled last night, I hear," said one of the
women, pushing back her plate and lighting a cigarette."Yes," returned Jude, "and why?Cause the house is owned by
Gannette--swell guy livin' up on Riverside Drive--and he don't divvy
with the city hall.Belle don't pay no such rent as the Madam does--at
least so old Lucy tells me."The half-intoxicated woman down the table, who had stirred their
laughter a few minutes before, now roused up heavily.Caught a pippin for her once--right off
the train--jus' like this li'l hussy.Went to th' depot in a hack.Saw
th' li'l kid comin' an' pretended to faint.Li'l kid run to me an'
asked could she help.Got her to see me safe home--tee!She's
workin' f'r ol' Lucy yet, sound's a dollar."She fixed her bleared eyes upon Carmen and lapsed back into her former
state of sodden stupidity.The policeman's words at the
pier were floating confusedly through her thought.The strange talk of
these women increased the confusion.Another of the women got up hurriedly and left the table."I haven't
the nerve for another sob-scene," she commented as she went out.pleaded Carmen, turning from one to
another.Jude reached out and seized her hand tightly.Then, to Carmen:

"You are in a--a hotel," she said abruptly."Oh--then--then it was a mistake?"The girl turned her great, yearning
eyes upon the woman."Sit down, and finish
your supper," she said harshly, pulling the girl toward the chair.The maudlin woman down the table chuckled thickly.The <DW64> waitress
went quickly out and closed the door.Jude rose, still holding the
girl's hand."Come up stairs with me," she said, leading her away.commented one of the women, when the two had left the
room.But she's housekeeper, and that's part of her job.Jude took the girl into her own room and locked the door.Then she
sank wearily into a chair.she cried, "I'm sick of this--sick
of the whole thing!"It was all a
mistake, and we can go.""Why, you said this was a hotel--"

"Hotel!Carmen gazed at the excited woman with a puzzled expression on her
face."Now listen," said Jude, bracing herself, "I've got something to tell
you.For God's sake, child,
don't look at me that way!"Your face looks as if you had come down from the sky.But if you did,
and if you believe in a God, you had better pray to Him now!"I was afraid--a
little--at first.When we stop and just know that we love
everybody, and that everybody really loves us, why, we can't be afraid
any more, can we?"The woman looked up at the child in blank amazement.That
warped, twisted word conveyed no meaning to her.And God--it was only
a convenient execrative.But--what was it that looked out from that
strange girl's eyes?What
was emerging from those unfathomable depths, twining itself about her
withered heart and expanding her black, shrunken soul?Whence came
that beautiful, white life that she was going to blast?"Look here," she cried sharply, "tell me again all about yourself, and
about your friends and family down south, and what it was that the
Madam said to you!Carmen sat down at her feet, and taking her hand, went again over the
story.As the child talked, the woman's hard eyes widened, and now and
then a big tear rolled down the painted cheek.Her thought began to
stray back, far back, along the wreck-strewn path over which she
herself had come.At last in the dim haze she saw again the little New
England farm, and her father, stern, but honest and respected,
trudging behind the plow.In the cottage she saw her white-haired
mother, every lineament bespeaking her Puritan origin, hovering over
her little household like a benediction.Then night fell, swiftly as
the eagle swoops down upon its prey, and she awoke from a terrible
dream, stained, abandoned, lost--and seared with a foul oath to drag
down to her own level every innocent girl upon whom her hands might
thereafter fall!"And I have just had to know," Carmen concluded, "every minute since I
left Simiti, that God was everywhere, and that He would not let any
harm come to me.But when we really know that, why, the way _always_
opens.For that's prayer, right prayer; the kind that Jesus taught."The woman sat staring at the girl, an expression of utter blankness
upon her pallid face.Oh, yes, she had been taught to pray.Well she remembered, though the memory now cut like a knife, how she
knelt at her beautiful mother's knee and asked the good Father to
bless and protect them all, even to the beloved doll that she hugged
to her little bosom.But God had never heard her petitions, innocent
though she was.And He had let her fall, even with a prayer on her
lips, into the black pit!A loud sound of male voices and a stamping of feet rose from below.The woman sprang to the door and stood listening."It's the boys from
the college!"She turned and stood hesitant for a moment, as if striving to
formulate a plan.A look of fierce determination came into her face.She went to the bureau and took from the drawers several articles,
which she hastily thrust into the pocket of her dress."Now," she said, turning to Carmen and speaking in a low, strained
voice, "you do just as I say.And for God's sake
don't speak!"Leaving the light burning, she stepped quickly out with Carmen and
locked the door after her.Then, bidding the girl wait, she slipped
softly down the hall and locked the door of the room to which the girl
had first been taken.Laughter and music floated up from below, mingled with the clink of
glasses.The air was heavy with perfume and tobacco smoke.A door near
them opened, and a sound of voices issued.The woman pulled Carmen
into a closet until the hall was again quiet.Then she hurried on to
another door which she entered, dragging the girl with her.Groping through the darkness, she reached a
window, across which stood a hinged iron grating, secured with a
padlock.The woman fumbled among her keys and unfastened this.Swinging it wide, and opening the window beyond, she bade the girl
precede her cautiously."It's a fire-escape," she explained briefly.She reached through the
window grating and fastened the padlock; then closed the window; and
quickly descended with the girl to the ground below.Pausing a moment to get her breath, she seized Carmen's hand and crept
swiftly around the big house and into a dark alley.There she stopped
to throw over her shoulders a light shawl which she had taken from the
bureau.Their course lay through the muddy alley for several blocks.When they
emerged they were in a dimly lighted cross street.The air was chill,
and the thinly clad woman shivered.Carmen, fresh from the tropics,
felt the contrast keenly.A few moments' rapid walking down the street
brought them to a large building of yellow brick, surrounded by a high
board fence.The woman unfastened the gate and hurried up to the door,
over which, by the feeble light of the street lamp, Carmen read, "The
Little Sisters of the Poor."A black-robed woman admitted them and went to summon the Sister
Superior.Carmen marveled at her strange attire.A moment later they
were silently ushered into an adjoining room, where a tall woman,
similarly dressed, awaited them."Sister," said Jude excitedly, "here's a little kid--you got to care
for her until she finds her friends!"The Sister Superior instantly divined the status of the woman."Let
the child wait here a moment," she said, "and you come with me and
tell your story.It would be better that she should not hear."Carmen was drowsing in her
chair."She's chock full of religion," the woman was saying."But you," the Sister replied, "what will you do?"Then you will stay here until--"

"No, no!I have friends--others like myself--I will go to them.I--I
couldn't stay here--with her," nodding toward the girl."But--you will
take care of her?""Surely," returned the Sister in a calm voice.Then she turned abruptly and went swiftly out into the chill night."Come," said the Sister to Carmen, extending a hand.CHAPTER 2


Carmen was astir next morning long before the rising-bell sounded its
shrill summons through the long corridors.When she opened her eyes
she gazed at the ceiling above in perplexity.She still seemed to feel
the tossing motion of the boat, and half believed the bell to be the
call to the table, where she should again hear the cheery voice of
Harris and meet the tolerant smile of Mrs.Then a rush of
memories swept her, and her heart went down in the flood.She was
alone in a great foreign city!She turned her face to the pillow, and
for a moment a sob shook her.Then she reached under the pillow and
drew out the little Bible, which she had taken from her bundle and
placed there when the Sister left her the night before.The book fell
open to Isaiah, and she read aloud:

  "I the Lord have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine
  hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the
  people, for a light of the Gentiles.""That means me," she said
firmly."Padre Jose said I had a message for the world; and now I
am to tell it to these people up here.That means, He has called me to do _right thinking_.And I am to tell these people how to think right.Suddenly her thought reverted to Cartagena, and to the sturdy little
lad who had so proudly claimed the name of Rincon.Then she burst into tears and threw herself back upon the
bed."I must think only God's thoughts,"
she said, struggling to her feet and checking her grief."If it is
right for the little boy to be his son, then I must want it to be so.I _must_ want only the right--I have _got_ to want it!And if it is
not right now, then God will make it so.It is all in His hands, and I
must not think of it any more, unless I think right thoughts."She dressed herself quickly, but did not put on the shoes."I simply
can not wear these things," she mourned, looking at them dubiously;
"and I do not believe the woman will make me.I wonder why the other
woman called her Sister.Why did she wear that ugly black bonnet?And
why was I hurried away from that hotel?It was so much pleasanter
there, so bright and warm; and here it is so cold."She shivered as
she buttoned her thin dress."But," she continued, "I have got to go
out now and find Mr.Harris--I have just _got_ to find
them--and to-day!But, oh, this city is so much larger than Simiti!"She shook her head in perplexity as she put the Bible back again in
the bundle, where lay the title papers to La Libertad and her mother's
little locket, which Rosendo had given her that last morning in
Simiti.The latter she drew out and regarded wistfully for some
moments."I haven't any father or mother but God," she murmured."But
He is both father and mother to me now."With a little sigh she tied
up the bundle again.Holding it in one hand and carrying the much
despised shoes in the other, she left the cheerless room and started
down the long, cold hall.When she reached the stairway leading to the floor below she stopped
abruptly."I have been
thinking only of myself.What is it that the Bible says?--'And I will bring them by a way
that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not
known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things
straight.'And Padre Jose said he would
remember it, too."Again she choked back the tears which surged up at the remembrance of
the priest, and, bracing herself, hastily descended the stairs,
murmuring at every step, "God is everywhere--right here!"At the far end of the lower hall she saw, through an open door, a
number of elderly people sitting at long tables.When she reached the door, she stopped and peered
curiously within.A murmur of astonishment rose from the inmates
when they caught sight of the quaint object in the doorway, standing
uncertainly, with her shoes in one hand, the awkwardly tied bundle in
the other, and garbed in the chaotic attire so hastily procured for
her in Cartagena.A Sister came quickly forward and, taking the girl's hand, led her
into a smaller adjoining room, where sat the Sister Superior at
breakfast.The latter greeted the child gently and bade her be seated
at the table.Carmen dropped into a chair and sat staring in naive
wonder."Well," began the Sister at length, "eat your breakfast quickly.This
is Sunday, you know, and Mass will be said in the chapel in half an
hour.But you are with friends
here, little girl.Carmen quickly recovered her spirits, and her nimble tongue its wonted
flexibility.Without further invitation or preface she entered at once
upon a lively description of her wonderful journey through the jungle,
the subsequent ocean voyage, and the mishap at the pier, and concluded
with the cryptical remark: "And, you know, Senora, it is all just as
Padre Jose said, only a series of states of consciousness, after
all!"The Sister stared blankly at the beaming child.What manner of being
was this that had been so strangely wafted into these sacred precincts
on the night breeze!The abandoned woman who had brought her there,
the Sister remembered, had dropped an equally cryptical remark--"She's
chock full of religion."But gratitude quickly mastered her wonder, and the woman, pondering
the child's dramatic recital, murmured a sincere, "The Virgin be
praised!""Oh," said Carmen, looking up quickly as she caught the words, "you
people up here talk just like those in Simiti.But Padre Jose said you
didn't know, either.You ought to, though, for you have had so many
more ad--advantages than we have.Senora, there are many big, clumsy
words in the English language, aren't there?We used to speak it all the time during the
last years we were together.He said it seemed easier to talk about
God in that language than in any other."And who is this
Jose that you talk so much about?""He--taught me--in Simiti."Well," replied the Sister warmly, "he seems to have taught you queer
things!"returned Carmen quickly, "he just taught me the truth.He
didn't tell me about the queer things in the world, for he said they
were not real."Again the Sister stared at the girl in dumb amazement.But the child's
thought had strayed to other topics.she
exclaimed, shivering and drawing her dress about her."I guess I'll
have to put on these shoes to keep my feet warm.""Didn't you
wear shoes in your country?""No," replied Carmen, tugging and straining at the shoes; "I didn't
wear much of anything, it was so warm.Oh, it is beautiful down there,
Senora, so beautiful and warm in Simiti!"She sighed, and her eyes
filled with tears.But she brushed them away and smiled bravely up at
the Sister."I've come here because it is right," she said with a firm
nod of her head."Padre Jose said I had a message for you.He said you
didn't know much about God up here.Why, I don't know much of anything
else!"She laughed a happy little laugh as she said this.Then she
went on briskly:

"You know, Senora, Padre Jose isn't really a priest.But he said he
had to stay in the Church in order to teach me.I am sure he just thought wrong about it.But, anyway,
he will not have to be a priest any more, now that I have gone, will
he?You know, Don Jorge said priests were a bad lot; but that isn't
so, for there are many good priests, aren't there?Why, Senora," she exclaimed,
suddenly remembering the Sister's previous injunction, "is this a
church?You said there would be Mass in the chapel--"

"No," replied the Sister, still studying the girl attentively, while
her manner became more severe; "this is a home for old people, a
charitable institution.""Oh," replied Carmen, with a very vague idea of what that meant."Well," her face alight and her eyes dancing, "I don't belong here
then, do I?I am never going to be old," she meditated.The Bible says we
are made in His image and likeness.Well, if that is so, how can we
ever grow old?Just think of God hobbling around in heaven with a cane
and saying: 'Well, I'm getting old now!We wouldn't grow old and die if it wasn't for our wrong
way of thinking, would we?When we think His thoughts, why, we will be
like Him.Padre Jose says this, and he knows it is
true--only, he seems to have a hard time proving it.But, Senora, we
have all got to prove it, some time, every one of us.And then there
will not be any places like this for old people--people who still
believe that two and two are seven, you know.The woman looked at her blankly; but the girl rambled on."Padre Jose
sometimes talked of the charitable institutions out in the world, and
he always said that charity was a crime against the people.And he was
right, for that is just the way Jesus looked at it, isn't it?Jesus
did not give money to beggars, but he did better, he healed them of
the bad state of mind that was making them poor and sick.Jesus, when he taught,
first said a thing, and then he turned right around and proved it.And, why, Senora,
I've had thousands of proofs!"The Sister did not reply; and Carmen, stealing a covert glance at her,
continued:

"You know, Senora, it is just as wicked to be sick and poor as it is
to tell a lie, because being sick and poor is just the ex--the
ex-ter-nal-i-zation of our thought; and such thought is not from God;
and so to hold such thoughts and to believe them real is to believe in
power apart from God.It is having other gods than the one God; and
that is breaking the very first Commandment, isn't it?Yes, it is; and
you can prove it, just as you can prove the principles in mathematics.Senora, do you know anything about mathematics?"The astonished woman made an involuntary sign of negation."Oh, Senora," cried the enthusiastic girl, "the things that Jesus
taught can be proved just as easily as we prove the rules in
mathematics!for they are truth, and all truth can be
demonstrated, you know.You know, Senora, God is everywhere--not only
in heaven, but right here where we are.Heaven, Padre Jose used to say
so often, is only a perfect state of mind; and so it is, isn't it?And when we reflect Him perfectly, why, we
will be in heaven.But," she went on after catching
her breath, "we can't reflect Him as long as we believe evil to be
real and powerful.It is just zero, nothing--"

"I've heard that before," interrupted the woman, recovering somewhat
from her surprise."But I think that before you get out of New York
you will reverse that idea.There's a pretty fair amount of evil here,
and it is quite real, we find.""If it is real, then God made it.It
seems real to you--but that is only because you give it reality in
your consciousness.You believe it real, and so it becomes to you.""Well," said the woman dryly, "on that basis I think the same may be
said of good, too.""No," answered Carmen eagerly, "good is--"

"There," interrupted the Sister coldly, holding up an admonitory hand,
"we are not going to discuss the foolish theological notions which
that fallen priest put into your poor little head.The child looked at the woman in mute protest.It was a new thought, and
one that she would not accept."Senora," she began again, after a brief interval, "Padre Jose is a
good man, even the human Padre Jose.And he is trying to solve his
problem and know God.And he is trying to know himself, not as other
people think they know him, but as God knows him, and as I have always
tried to know him.You have no right to judge him--and, anyway, you
are not judging him, but only your wrong idea of him.And that," she
said softly, "is nothing."She was beginning to feel the spell of
those great brown eyes, that soft, rich voice, and the sparkling
expression of innocence, purity, and calm assurance that bubbled from
those red lips.And she was losing herself in contemplation of the
girl's luxuriant beauty, whose rich profusion her strange, foreign
attire could not disguise."Senora," said Carmen suddenly, "the people on the boat laughed at my
clothes.But I don't think them half as funny as that great black
bonnet you are wearing.I never saw one until I
was brought here."It was said innocently, and with no thought of offense.But the woman
instantly roused from her meditation and assumed an attitude of
severe dignity."And
remember after this that children's manners here are not those of your
country."The girl fell quiet under the rebuke, and the meal ended in silence.As they were rising from the table a cheery voice came from the outer
room, and presently a priest looked in."Good morning, Sister," he cried heartily.He was a young man, apparently still in the
twenties, of athletic build, inclined rather to stoutness, and with a
round, shining face that radiated health and good nature."It is a little
waif," she said in answer to his query, "who strayed in here last
night.""Aha," said the priest, "another derelict!And will you send her to
the orphanage?""I'm afraid if I do the little heretic will corrupt all the other
children," replied the Sister."Father," she continued seriously, "I
want you to examine this child, and then tell me what you think should
be done with her.""No," replied the Sister; "but another priest has gone wrong, and
this," pointing to Carmen, "is the result of his pernicious
teachings.""Very well, Sister," he said in a low voice."I will talk with her
after the service."He seemed suddenly to have lost his cheerfulness,
as he continued to converse with the woman on matters pertaining to
the institution.Carmen, wondering and receptive, took the place assigned to her in the
chapel and sat quietly through the service.She had often seen Jose
celebrate Mass in the rude little church in Simiti, but with no such
elaboration as she witnessed here.Once or twice she joined in the
responses, not with any thought of worship, but rather to give vent,
even if slight, to the impelling desire to hear her own musical voice.She thought as she did so that the priest looked in her direction.She
thought others looked at her attentively at the same time.But they
had all stared at her, for that matter, and she had felt confused and
embarrassed under their searching scrutiny.Yet the old people
attracted her peculiarly.Never had she seen so many at one time.And
never, she thought, had she seen such physical decrepitude and
helplessness.And then she fell to wondering what they were all there
for, and what they got out of the service.Did they believe that thereby their sins were atoned?Did
they believe that that priest was really changing the wafer and wine
into flesh and blood?She recalled much that Jose had told her about
the people up in the States.They were not so different, mentally,
from her own, after all.The people, still gossiping cheerfully,
had prostrated themselves before it.The sermon had been short, for
the old people waxed impatient at long discourses.Then the priest
descended from the pulpit and came to Carmen."Now, little girl," he
said, seating himself beside her, "tell me all about yourself, who you
are, where you come from, and what you have been taught.Carmen smiled up at him; then plunged into
her narrative.It was two hours later when the Sister Superior looked in and saw the
priest and girl still sitting in earnest conversation."But," she heard the priest say, "you tell me that this
Father Jose taught you these things?""He taught me English, and French, and German.And he taught me all I know of history, and of the
world," the girl replied."Yes, yes," the priest went on hurriedly; "but these other things,
these religious and philosophical notions, who taught you these?"The Sister drew closer and strained her ears to hear.The girl looked down as she answered softly, "God."He reached out and laid a hand
on hers."I believe you," he said, in a voice scarcely audible."I
believe you--for we do not teach such things.""Then," she said quizzically,
"you are not really a priest."The Sister's voice rang sternly through the quiet
chapel."The dinner-bell
will ring in a few minutes," continued the Sister, regarding the man
severely."Ah, true," he murmured, hastily glancing at the clock."The time
passed so rapidly--a--a--this girl--"

"Leave the girl to me," replied the Sister coldly."Unless," she
added, "you consider her deranged.Coming from that hot country
suddenly into this cold climate might--"

"No, no," interrupted the priest hastily; "she seems uncommonly strong
mentally.She has some notions that are a--somewhat different from
ours--that is--but I will come and have a further talk with her."He raised his hand in silent benediction, while the Sister bowed her
head stiffly.Then, as if loath to take his eyes from the girl, he
turned and went slowly out.Carmen followed her out into the hall
and down a flight of steps to the kitchen below."Katherine," said the Sister Superior, addressing an elderly,
white-haired Sister who seemed to be in charge of the culinary
department, "put this girl to work.Let her eat with you and sleep in
your room.And see if you can't work some of the foolish notions out
of her head."CHAPTER 3


"Get some o' th' foolish notions out of your head, is it?Och, puir
bairn, wid yer swate face an' that hivenly hair, it's welcome ye air
to yer notions!Ye have talked too brash to the Sister
Superior.But, mind your tongue,
honey.Tell your funny notions to old Katie, an' they'll be safe as
the soul of Saint Patrick; but keep mum before the others, honey.""But, Senora, don't they want to know the truth up here?"There was a
note of appeal in the quavering voice."Now listen, honey; don't call me sich heathen names.I'm no Senora, whativer that may be.And as for wantin' to know the
truth, God bless ye, honey!"They don't, Sen--Sister!""Well, thin, they don't--an' mebby I'm not so far from agreein' wid
ye.But, och, it's dead beat I am, after the Sunday's work!But ye air
a right smart little helper, honey--only, ye don't belong in th'
kitchen.""Sen--I mean, Sister--"

"That's better, honey; ye'll get it in time.""Sister, I've just _got_ to find Mr."No, honey, it's few I know outside these walls.But ye can put up a
bit of a prayer when ye turn in to-night.An' we'd best be makin' for
th' bed, too, darlin', for we've a hard day's work to-morrow."It was Carmen's second night in New York, and as the girl silently
followed the puffing old woman up the several long, dark flights of
stairs to the little, cheerless room under the eaves, it seemed to her
that her brain must fly apart with the pressure of its mental
accumulation.The great building in which she was now sheltered, the
kitchen, with its marvels of equipment, gas stoves, electric lights,
annunciators, and a thousand other equally wonderful appliances which
the human mind has developed for its service and comfort, held her
fascinated, despite her situation, while she swelled with questions
she dared not ask.Notwithstanding the anxiety which she had not
wholly suppressed, her curiosity, naive, eager, and insatiable, rose
mountain high.Sister Katherine had been kind to her, had received her
with open arms, and given her light tasks to perform.And many times
during the long afternoon the old woman had relaxed entirely from her
assumed brusqueness and stooped to lay a large, red hand gently upon
the brown curls, or to imprint a resounding kiss upon the flushed
cheek.Now, as night was settling down over the great, roaring city,
the woman took the homeless waif into her big heart and wrapped her in
a love that, roughly expressed, was yet none the less tender and
sincere."Ye can ask the Virgin, honey, to send ye to yer frinds," said the
woman, as they sat in the gloaming before the window and looked out
over the kindling lights of the city."Not much, I guess, honey," answered the woman frankly."Troth, an'
I've asked her fer iverything in my time, from diamonds to a husband,
an' she landed me in a convint!"You didn't ask in the right way, Sister--"

"Faith, I asked in ivery way I knew how!An' whin I had th' carbuncle
on me neck I yelled at her!Sure she may have answered me prayer, fer
th' whoop I gave busted the carbuncle, an' I got well.Ye nivir kin
tell, honey."But, Sis--I can't call you Sister!"pleaded the girl, going to the
woman and twining her arms about her neck."Och, honey darlin'"--tears started from the old woman's eyes and
rolled down her wrinkled cheeks--"honey darlin', call me Katie, just
old Katie.Och, Holy Virgin, if I could have had a home, an' a
beautiful daughter like you--!"She clasped the girl in her great arms
and held her tightly."Katie, when you pray you must pray knowing that God has already given
you what you need, and that there is nothing that can keep you from
seeing it.""An' so, darlin', if I want
diamonds I must know that I have 'em, is it that, honey?"murmured Carmen, drawing closer, and laying her soft
cheek against the leathery visage of the old woman."Say that again, honey--och, say it again!It's words, darlin', that's
nivir been said to old Katie!""Why, hasn't any one ever been kind to you?"Och, ivirybody's kind to me, honey!But nobody has ivir loved
me--that way.The good Lord made me a fright, honey--ain't ye noticed?An' they told me from th' cradle up I'd nivir
land a man.An' I didn't, honey; they all ran from me--an' so I become
a bride o' th' Church."But, Katie, the face is nothing.Why, your heart is as big--as big as
the whole world!I hadn't been with you an hour before I knew that."Och, darlin'," murmured the woman, "sure th' Virgin be praised fer
sendin' ye to me, a lonely old woman!""It was not the Virgin, Katie, but God who brought me here," said the
girl gently, as she caressed the old Sister's cheek."It's all one, honey; the Virgin's th' Mother o' God.""Troth, child, she has th' same power as God!Don't we pray to her,
an' she prays to th' good God to save us?There is no person or thing that persuades God to be
good to His children.He is
infinite--infinite mind, Katie, and infinite good.Oh, Katie, what
awful things are taught in this world as truth!How little we know of
the great God!And yet how much people pretend they know about Him!But if they only knew--really _knew_, as Jesus did--why, Katie, there
wouldn't be an old person, or a sick or unhappy one in the whole
world!Katie," after a little pause, "I know."Air these more o' yer funny
notions, darlin'?""I suppose they are what the world thinks funny, Katie," answered the
girl.But then,
th' world moves, girlie--even old Katie sees that.Only, the Church
don't move with it.An' old Katie can see that, too.An' so, I'm
thinkin', does Father Waite.""Faith, an' how do ye know it, child?""He talked with me--a long time, this morning.He said God had taught
me what I know."Thin me own suspicions air right; he's out o' tune!Did ye say, girlie dear, that he didn't scold ye fer yer funny
notions?""No, Katie, he said they were right."Thin, lassie dear, things is goin' to happen.An' he's a
good man--troth, they make no better in this world!"Carmen looked out wonderingly over
the city.She yearned to know what it held for her."Katie," she said at length, bending again over the woman, "will you
help me find Mr."Och, lassie--what's your name again?""Carmen," replied the girl, "Carmen Ariza.""Cair-men Aree--now ain't that a name fer ye!An' I'm Scotch-Irish, honey; an' we're both a long
way from th' ol' sod!Lassie dear, tell me about last night.But, no;
begin 'way back.Old Katie's weak in th' head,
girlie, but she may see a way out fer ye.Th' Virgin help ye, puir
bairn!"Midnight boomed from the bell in a neighboring tower when Carmen
finished her story.exclaimed the old Sister, staring at the girl
in amazement."Now do ye let me feel of ye to see that ye air human;
fer only a Saint could go through all that an' live to tell it!An'
the place ye were in last night!Now be Saint Patrick, if I was rich
I'd have Masses said every day fer that Jude who brung ye here!Don't
tell me th' good Lord won't forgive her!"She's a good woman, Katie; and, somehow, I felt sorry for her, but I
don't know why.She has a beautiful home in that hotel--"

"Hotel, is it!But--och, sure, it was a hotel, honey.Only, ye air better off here wi' old Katie."But--unless it's wi' Father
Waite, I don't know what I can do.Ye air in bad with th' Sister
Superior fer yer talk at th' breakfast table.Ye're a fresh little
heathen, honey.An' she's suspicious of Father Waite, too.An' he th' best man on airth!But his doctrine ain't just sound,
sweatheart.There,
honey, lave it to me.But it's got to be done quick, or th' Sister
Superior'll have ye in an orphan asylum, where ye'll stay till ye air
soused in th' doctrine!I can manage to get word to Father Waite
to-morrow, airly.A bit of a word wi'
him'll fix it, lassie dear.An' now, honey swate, off with them funny
clothes and plump into bed.it's all but marnin' now!"A few minutes later the woman turned to the girl who lay so quiet at
her side."Honey," she whispered, "was ye tellin' me awhile back that ye knew
the right way to pray?""Yes, Katie dear," the child murmured."Thin do you pray, lass, an' I'll not trouble the Virgin this night."*       *       *       *       *

"Well, Father, what do you think now?"The Sister Superior looked up
aggressively, as Father Waite slowly entered the room.His head was
bowed, and there was a look of deep earnestness upon his face."I have talked with her again--an hour, or more," he said reflectively."She is a--a remarkable girl, in many ways.""She attracts and repels me, both," she
said.And she appears to be
suffering from religious dementia.It was a compromising question, and the priest weighed his words
carefully before replying."She does--seem to--to have rather--a--rather
unusual--religious views," said he slowly."Would it not be well to have Dr."That we may know what to do with her.If she is mentally unsound she
must not be sent to the orphanage.""She should be taken--a--I mean, we should try to locate her friends.I have already searched the city directory; but, though there are many
Reeds, there are none listed with the initials she gave me as his.I
had thought," he continued hesitatingly, "I had thought of putting her
in charge of the Young Women's Christian Association--"

"Father Waite!"The Sister Superior rose and drew herself up to her
full height."Do you mean to say that you have contemplated delivering
her into the hands of heretics?"she demanded coldly, her tall figure
instinct with the mortal pride of religious superiority."Why, Sister," returned the priest with embarrassment, "would it not
be wise to place her among those whose views harmonize more closely
with hers than ours do?"urged the man, with a gesture of
impatience.The combined weight of all the
centuries of church authority could not make her one--never!I must
take her to those with whom she rightfully belongs."The Sister Superior's eyes narrowed and glittered, and her face grew
dark.I am in charge here, and I
shall report this case to the Bishop!"The futility of his case
seemed to impress him.Taking up his hat, he bowed without speaking
and went out.Outside
the door the man listened until he caught the number she called.His
face grew dark and angry, and his hands clenched a she strode down the
hall.On the stairs that led up from the kitchen stood Sister Katherine."Wait on th' corner--behind the church!The lassie will meet you
there!"Before he could reply the woman had plunged again into the dark
stairway.Stopping at a small closet below, she took out a bundle.Then she hurried to the kitchen and summoned Carmen, who was sitting
at a table peeling potatoes."Troth, lazy lass," she commanded sharply, "do you take the bucket and
mop and begin on the front steps.And mind that ye don't bring me
heavy hand down on ye!Och, lassie darlin'," she added, when she had
drawn the startled girl out of hearing of the others, "give yer old
Katie a kiss, and then be off!Troth, it breaks me heart to see ye
go--but 'twould break yours to stay!Go, lassie darlin', an' don't
fergit old Katie!Here," thrusting the girl's bundle and a dollar bill
into her hands, "an' God bless ye, lass!Ye've won me, heart an' soul!Ye'll find a frind at th' nixt corner!"She
strained the girl again to her breast, then opened the door and
hastily thrust her out into the street.For a moment Carmen stood dazed by the suddenness of it all.She
looked up confusedly at the great, yellow building from which she had
been ejected.Then, grasping her
bundle and the dollar bill, she hurried out through the gate and
started up the street.The man's face was furrowed, and
his body trembled.The girl went up to him with a glad smile.The
priest looked up, and muttered something incoherent under his breath a
she took her hand.He drew some loose change from his pocket, and hailed an approaching
street car."To police headquarters," he replied, "to ask them to help us find
your friends."CHAPTER 4


From the mysterious wastes which lie far out on the ocean, the fog was
again creeping stealthily across the bay and into the throbbing
arteries of the great city.Through half-opened doors and windows it
rolled like smoke, and piled like drifted snow against the mountains
of brick and stone.Caught for a moment on a transient breeze, it
swirled around a towering pile on lower Broadway, and eddied up to the
windows of the Ketchim Realty Company, where it sifted through the
chinks in the loose frames and settled like a pall over the dingy
rooms within.To Philip O. Ketchim, junior member of the firm, it seemed a fitting
external expression of the heavy gloom within his soul.Crumpled into
the chair at the broad table in his private office, with his long,
thin legs stretched out before him, his hands crammed into the pockets
of his trousers, and his bullet-shaped head sunk on his flat chest,
until it seemed as if the hooked nose which graced his hawk-like
visage must be penetrating his breast-bone, the man was the embodiment
of utter dejection.On the littered table, where he had just tossed
it, lay the report of Reed and Harris on the pseudo-mineral properties
of the Molino Company--the "near-mines" in the rocky canon of the
far-off Boque.Near it lay the current number of a Presbyterian
review, wherein the merits of this now moribund project were
advertised in terms whose glitter had attracted swarms of eager,
trusting investors.The firm name of Ketchim Realty Company was something of a misnomer.The company itself was an experiment, whose end had not justified its
inception.It had been launched a few years previously by Douglass
Ketchim to provide business careers for his two sons, James and
Philip.The old gentleman, still hale and vigorous, was one of those
sturdy Englishmen who had caught the infection of '49 and abruptly
severed the ties which bound them to their Kentish homes for the
allurements of the newly discovered El Dorado of western America.Across the death-haunted Isthmus of Panama and up the inhospitable
Pacific coast the indomitable spirit of the young adventurer drove
him, until he reached the golden sands of California.There he toiled
for many years, until Fortune at length smiled upon his quenchless
efforts.Then he tossed aside his rough tools and set out for the less
constricted fields of the East.He invested his money wisely, and in the course of years turned it
several times.He aspired to the hand of a
sister of a railway president, and won it.He educated his sons in the
best colleges of the East, and then sent them to Europe on their
honeymoons.And finally, when the burden of years began to press
noticeably, and the game became less attractive, he retired from
the field of business, cleared off his indebtedness, organized the
Ketchim Realty Company, put its affairs on the best possible basis,
and then committed the unpardonable folly of turning it over to the
unrestricted management of his two sons.At the expiration of a year the old gentleman
hurried back into the harness to save the remnant of his fortune, only
to find it inextricably tied up in lands of dubious value and
questionable promotional schemes.The untangling of the real estate he
immediately took into his own hands.A word in passing regarding these sons, for they typify a form of
parasitical growth, of the fungus variety, which in these days has
battened and waxed noxious on the great stalk of legitimate commercial
enterprise.They were as dissimilar, and each as unlike his father, as
is possible among members of the same family.Both sought, with
diligent consecration, the same goal, money; but employed wholly
different means to gain that end.James, the elder, was a man of ready
wit, a nimble tongue, and a manner which, on occasions when he could
think of any one but himself, was affable and gracious.He was a
scoffer of religion, an open foe of business scruple, and the avowed
champion of every sort of artifice and device employed in ancient,
mediaeval, or modern finance to further his own selfish desires, in
the minimum of time, and at whatever cost to his fellow-man.In his
cups he was a witty, though arrogant, braggart.In his home he was
petulant and childish.Of real business acumen and constructive
wisdom, he had none.He would hew his way to wealth, if need be,
openly defiant of God, man, or the devil.Or he would work in subtler
ways, through deceit, jugglery, or veiled bribe.But he generally wore
his heart on his sleeve; and those who perforce had business relations
with him soon discovered that, though utterly unscrupulous, his
character was continuously revealed through his small conceit, which
caused him so to work as to be seen of men and gain their cheap
plaudits for his sharp, mendacious practices.Philip retained a degree of his father's confidence--which James
wholly lacked--and he spared himself no pains to cultivate it.Though
far less ready of wit than his stubby, bombastic brother, he was a
tenacious plodder, and was for this reason much more likely ultimately
to achieve his sordid purposes.His energy was tireless, and he never
admitted defeat.He never worked openly; he never appeared to have a
decided line of conduct; and no one could ever say what particular
course he intended to pursue.Apparently, he was a man of exemplary
habits; and his mild boast that he knew not the taste of tobacco or
liquor could not be refuted.He was an elder in the Presbyterian
church in the little suburb where he lived, and superintendent of its
Sunday school.His prayers were beautiful expressions of reverent
piety; and his conversation, at all times chaste and modest, announced
him a man of more than ordinary purity of thought and motive.While it
is true that no one could recall any pious deed, any charitable act,
or any conduct based on motives of self-abnegation and brotherly love
performed by him, yet no one could ever point to a single coarse or
mean action emanating from the man.If there was discord in company
affairs, the wanton James always bore the onus.And because of this,
relations between the brothers gradually assumed a condition of
strain, until at length James openly and angrily denounced Philip as a
hypocrite, and refused longer to work with him.Thereupon the milder
Philip offered the other cheek and installed a mediator, in the person
of one Rawlins, a sickly, emaciated, bearded, but loyal Hermes, who
thenceforth performed the multifold functions of pacificator,
go-between, human telephone, and bearer of messages, documents, and
what-not from one to the other for a nominal wage and the crumbs that
dropped from the promoter's table.The fog and the gloom thickened, and Ketchim sat deeply immersed in
both.He was still shaking from the fright which he had received that
morning.On opening the door as he was about to leave his house to
take the train to the city, he had confronted two bulky policemen.With a muffled shriek he had slammed the door in their astonished
faces and darted back into the house, his heart in his throat and
hammering madly.How could he know that they were only selling tickets
to a Policemen's Ball?Then he had crept to the window and, concealed
in the folds of the curtain, had watched them go down the street,
laughing and turning often to glance back at the house that held such
a queer-mannered inmate.Rousing himself from the gloomy revery into which he had lapsed,
Ketchim switched on the light and took up again the report of Reed
and Harris.Sullenly he turned its pages, while the sallow skin on his
low forehead wrinkled, and his bird-like face drew into ugly
contortions."Didn't they see that clause in their contract,
providing an additional fifty thousand in stock for them in case they
made a favorable report?"A light tap at the door, and a low cough, preceded the noiseless
entrance of the meek-souled Rawlins."A--a--this is the list which Reverend Jurges sent us--names and
addresses of his congregation.I've mailed them all descriptive
matter; and I wrote Mr.Jurges that the price of his stock would be
five dollars, but that we couldn't sell to his congregation for less
than seven.I told him Molino stock would go
up to par next month."How much stock did Jurges say he'd take?"demanded Ketchim, without
looking up."Why, he said he could only get together two thousand dollars at
present, but that later he would have some endowment insurance falling
due--"

"How soon?""About a year, I think he said.""Well, he ought to be able to borrow on that."Do so--but only hint at it.And tell him to send his check at once
for the stock he has agreed to take.""Why, he sent that some days ago.I thought you--"

"He did?"cried Ketchim, his interest now fully aroused."Er--your brother James received the letter, and I believe he put the
check in his pocket."Ketchim gave vent to a snort of rage."You tell James," he cried,
pounding the desk with his fist, "that as president and treasurer of
the Molino Company I demand that check!""Yes, sir--and--"

"Well?"Cass 'phoned before you got down this morning.He said the bank
refused to extend the time on your note."Ketchim sank back limply into his chair, and his face became ashen."And here is the mail," pursued the gentle Hermes, handing him a
bundle of letters.Ketchim roused himself with an effort."Do
you know whether James has been selling any of his own Molino stock?""I--I believe he has, sir--a little.""He sold some two hundred shares yesterday--I believe; to a Miss
Leveridge.""Why, the Leveridge children--grown men and women now--have just sold
their farm down state; and Mr.James saw the sale announced in the
papers.So he got in touch with Miss Alvina Leveridge.I believe he
sent Houghton down there; and he closed a deal.James got eight
dollars a share, I believe."Ketchim gulped down his wrath, and continued:

"How much did the Leveridges get for their farm?And why didn't you
inform me of the sale?"he demanded, fixing the humble Rawlins with a
cold eye."A--a--twenty-five thousand dollars, sir, I believe.And I didn't see
the notice until--"

"As usual, James saw it first!"James is still dickering with Miss Leveridge, I
suppose?""Nezlett got back last night, didn't he?Very well, call him up and
tell him to get ready to go at once to--wherever the Leveridges live.And--I want to see him right away!"He abruptly dismissed the factotum and turned to his mail.As his
glance fell upon the pile he gasped.Then he quickly drew out a letter
and tore it open.His thin lips moved rapidly as his eyes roved over
the paper.He laid the letter down and looked wildly about.Then he
took it up again and read aloud the closing words:

  "--and, having bought somewhat heavily of Molino stock, and
  believing that your representations were made with intent to
  deceive, I shall, unless immediate reparation or satisfactory
  explanation is made, take such steps as my counsel may advise."Yours, etc.,
                                                 "J. WILTON AMES."Congealing with fear, Ketchim took his stock memorandum from a drawer
and consulted it."He put in ten thousand, cash," he murmured, closing
the book and replacing it."And I always wondered why, for he doesn't
go into things that he can't control.He
shouldn't have been sold a dollar's worth!He knows we can't return
the money; and now he's tightening the screws!He has something up his
sleeve; and we've fallen for it!"He settled back in his chair and groaned aloud.Did
he think he'd reach Uncle Ted through us?For a
year or more he's wanted to oust Uncle from the C.& R., and now he
thinks by threatening the family with disgrace, and us fellows with
the pen, he can do it!Oh, if I ever get out of
this I'll steer clear of these deals in the future!"It was his stock
resolution, which had never borne fruit.The door opened slightly, and the noiseless Rawlins timidly announced
the arrival of Reed and Harris.cried Ketchim, jumping up and hastily passing
his hands over his hair and face.Then, advancing with a wan smile, he
courteously greeted the callers."Well, fellows," he began, waving them to seats, "it looks a
little bad for Molino, doesn't it?I've just been reading your
report--although of course you told me over the 'phone yesterday
that there was no hope.But," he continued gravely, and his face
grew serious, "I'm glad, very glad, of one thing, and that is that
there are men in the world to-day who are above temptation.""Why," continued Ketchim, smiling pallidly, "the little joker that
James inserted in the contract, about your getting fifty thousand in
the event of a favorable report.I told him it didn't look well--but
he said it would test you.He would be funny, though, no matter how
serious the business.Harris snickered; but Reed turned the conversation at once."We have
been studying how we could help you pull the thing out of the fire.Suppose you give us," he suggested, "a little of Molino's history."There isn't much to tell," replied Ketchim gloomily."The mines were
located by a man named Lakes, at one time acting-Consul at Cartagena.He came up to New York and interested
Bryan, Westler, and some others, and they asked us to act as fiscal
agents.""But you never had title to the property," said Reed."Because, on our way down the Magdalena river we made the acquaintance
of a certain Captain Pinal, of the Colombian army.When he learned
that we were mining men he told us he had a string of rich properties
that he would like to sell.I inquired their location, and he said
they lay along the Boque river.And I learned that he had clear title
to the property, too--Molino's mines.Now you have sold some three or
four hundred thousand dollars' worth of stock on alleged mines to
which you never had even the shadow of a claim!""But--" murmured Ketchim weakly, "we thought we had.We acted in good
faith--we took Mr.Lakes's word--and we showed our confidence and
sincerity by purchasing machinery to operate--"

"Oh, the machinery went down there, all right!""I judge it was designed to manufacture barrel staves, rather
than to extract gold!Lakes had it shipped to Cartagena; rented part
of an old woman's house; dumped the machinery in there; and now she's
wild.Can't get her pay from you for storing the machinery; and can't
sell the stuff, nor move it.So there she sits, under some six or
eight tons of iron junk, waiting for the Lord to perform a miracle!""But Molino has no
funds--"

"You are still selling stock, aren't you?""We would not sell any more stock
until we received your report--and not then, unless the report were
favorable.But the image of truth sat enthroned upon
Ketchim's sharp features."It is unfortunate, boys," the promoter continued dejectedly."But I
care nothing for my own losses; it's the poor stockholders I am
thinking about.I've prayed to be
led to do right."I suggest," blurted out Harris, "that, having already relieved them
considerably, you'll soon be wearing a striped suit!"The last trace of color faded from Ketchim's face, but the sickly
smile remained."I'd wear it, willingly, if by so doing I could help
these poor people," he mournfully replied."Well," pursued Harris, "it'll help some when they learn that you're
in one.""Boys," said Ketchim suddenly, quite disregarding the insinuation,
"to-morrow is Sunday, and I want you both out to dinner with me, and
we will talk this all over.Then in the afternoon I want you to come
over and see my little Sunday school.Fellows," he continued gravely,
"I've prayed for you and for your success every day since you left.And my faith in my Saviour is too great to be shattered now by your
adverse report.He certainly will show us a way out; and I can trust
him and wait."Reed and Harris looked at him and then at each other with puzzled
expressions on their faces.The man continued earnestly:

"Colombia is a rich and undeveloped country, you have said.There must
be other mineral properties available there.Did you see none on your
travels?Or could we not organize an exploration party to search for
mines?""Will your sheep stand for further shearing?""Fellows," said Ketchim, brightening and drawing his chair closer,
"you've got something--I know it!You've got something to suggest that
will save the Molino stockholders!""I shall sacrifice myself," answered Ketchim deprecatingly.His manner
had now become animated, and he leaned expectantly toward them.Reed and Harris again looked questioningly at each other."I guess we
might as well," said Reed in a low voice."It is bound to come out,
anyway.""Sure," returned Harris; "drive ahead."Ketchim," began Reed, turning to the eager, fidgeting man, "when
I came to New York a year ago, looking for a business opening, my
friend and former classmate in the University, Mr.Cass, put me in
touch with you.At that time you were booming the Molino company hard,
and, I have no doubt, thought you really had something down in
Colombia.But when you offered to lease me a portion of your
properties there, I laughed at you.And, in the course of time, I
succeeded in convincing you that you knew nothing whatsoever about the
properties on which you were selling so much stock.Then, after months
of parley, from an offer to permit me to go down to Colombia at my own
expense to examine Molino's mines, to ascertain whether or not I
wished to operate a part of them on a royalty basis, you adopted my
own view, namely, that the time had come for you to know whether the
company possessed anything of value or not.And so you sent my
associate, Mr.Harris, and myself down there to examine and report on
Molino's so-called mines.And you gave us each a block of stock as
part compensation.And now you have got to
face a body of stockholders from whom you have lured thousands of
dollars by your misrepresentations.From talks with your salesmen, I
am convinced that this body of stockholders is made up chiefly of
widows and indigent clergymen.""Which of my salesmen told you that?""Let us waive that," replied Reed calmly."The fact is, you are in a
hard way just at present, is it not so?""Fellows," said Ketchim, with an air of penitent humility, "the
officers and stockholders of the Molino Company have been grossly
deceived and unfortunately--"

"All right," interrupted Reed, "we'll pass that.But Harris and I have
played square with you.And we are going to continue to do so, and to
offer you a possible opportunity to do something for your poor
stockholders, and incidentally for yourself and us.The fact is, we do
know of another property down there, but we haven't the title--"

"That makes no difference!""I mean, it can be
acquired--" striving to restrain his eagerness."That's just the question," replied Reed."The title is at present
vested in a young Colombian girl, who, unfortunately, is lost.This
girl came up to the States with us--"

"Ha!"exclaimed Ketchim, unable longer to hold himself."Then you
broke your contract, for that stipulated that whatever you might
acquire there should belong to me!"I believe," put in Harris dryly, "we were employed by the Molino
company.""But my mother advanced the funds to send you down there!"queried Harris, with an insinuating
grin."I'm speaking for the stockholders, of course," said Ketchim,
subsiding."There is no likelihood that this poor girl will ever be heard of
again," continued Reed."Nor is it likely that the title papers, which
she has with her, will be of any use to those into whose hands she has
fallen.Her old foster-father held the title to this mine, but
transferred it to the girl, stipulating that she and I should divide a
large interest in the stock of a company formed to develop and operate
it.For my share, I agreed to bring the young girl to the States and
place her in a school, at my own expense."He went on to relate the
manner in which Carmen had been lost, and then continued: "Of course,
the title to this mine is registered in Cartagena, and in the girl's
name, as the old man gave me power to have that change made.But, now
that she is gone, the property naturally reverts to him.""No, that wouldn't be right to the old man," returned Reed."But, it
might be that the property could now be secured from him.He is old
and penniless, and without any further interest in life.It is a bare
chance, but we might prevail upon him to join us in the formation of a
company to take over his mine, La Libertad."asked Ketchim, reaching for a writing pad.Reed complied, and then continued: "Now, Mr.Ketchim, we are living
strictly up to the letter of our contract by giving you this
information.It would require not less than one hundred thousand
dollars, cash in hand, to acquire that mine, develop it, make trails,
and erect a stamp-mill.Harris and I are in no condition
financially to advance or secure such an amount.""It is barely possible," mused Harris, "that my father and Uncle John
could do something.""We don't have to call upon them!"Reed, in this mine already belongs to Molino, as you were acting under
contract with us--"

"I have covered that point, Mr."But
the time has come for us all to put our shoulders to the wheel, act
fairly with one another, help the Molino stockholders, and at the same
time make good ourselves.Harris and I have barely entered upon
our business careers, and we have come to New York to establish
ourselves.We know where this mine
is--we know the old man, and may be able to influence him.To
forestall possible complications, we should begin negotiations with
him at once.But--remember--everything must be done in the name of the
company, not in your own name.Harris and I must personally
negotiate with the old man, and receive a very liberal compensation
for our work."why didn't
you tell me this yesterday over the 'phone, and save me a night of
torment?Rawlins," he said, addressing
that individual, who had entered in response to the buzzer, "'phone
Cass to come right over.And tell Miss Honeywell to give you ten
dollars for our lunch, and charge it to Molino.Since the old man gave
you a share in the mine, Molino has property, after all!""Has it to get," amended Harris dubiously.cried Ketchim, rubbing his hands gleefully."But
now while waiting for Cass, tell me more about your trip.In the midst of the ensuing recital, Cass was announced; and Ketchim,
after detailing to him the previous conversation, launched into the
project which had been developing in his own mind while Reed had been
describing his experiences in the South."What we want is another organization, fellows," he said in
conclusion, "to take over the tottering Molino; purchase its assets
with stock; give Molino stockholders an opportunity to get in on the
ground floor, and so on.We'll let Molino die in the arms of a new
company, eh?""But one with a somewhat wider scope," suggested Cass, with an air of
importance."A sort of general development company, to secure La
Libertad, if possible; prospect for other mineral properties; and
develop the resources of the country.""Just so," assented Ketchim, with increasing enthusiasm."A company to
go in for coffee, cotton--you say you saw wild cotton, didn't you,
fellows?And cocoanuts, timber, cattle--in fact, we'll get
concessions from the Colombian Government, and we'll--"

"Just rip things wide open, eh?""Uncle Ted has influence at
Washington, with the Pan American Union, and so on--why, we can get
anything we want!Ames and the bank will both cool down--by Jove, this
is great!""But where's the cold and vulgar cash coming from to oil the wheels?""Oh, I can sell the stock," replied Ketchim."Then, too, there's the
Molino stockholders; why, I'll bet there's hardly one that wouldn't be
able to scrape up a few dollars more for the new company!By the way,
what'll we call it?"I'd call it the Salvation Company," drawled Harris, "as it is likely
to delay your trip to Sing Sing."A general laugh, in which Ketchim joined heartily, followed the
remark."I suggest we call it the Simiti Development Company," said Cass,
after a moment's dignified reflection."If these gentlemen can acquire that mine, I
think I would capitalize for, say, about three millions."He went to
the desk and made some calculations."I assume," he continued somewhat
pompously after a few moments' figuring, "that you wish to retain me,
and that I am to take my compensation in stock?"He knew that Cass had correctly concluded
that in no other way was he likely to be reimbursed.And, at best, it
was only a hazard, a wild gamble.In fact, it was a last desperate
chance.Moreover, stock was always available; while cash was a rare
commodity."Suppose, then," continued the sapient young lawyer, "that we
capitalize for three millions; set aside one million, five hundred and
one thousand as treasury stock, to be sold to raise money for
development purposes; transfer to the Ketchim Realty Company one
million, as compensation for acting as fiscal agents of the new
company; transfer to these two gentlemen, as part compensation for
past and future services, the sum of four hundred thousand in stock;
give to the stockholders of the Molino Company the sum of fifty-nine
thousand in stock for all the assets, machinery, good will, _et
cetera_, of that company; and to me, for services to be rendered,
forty thousand dollars' worth of the stock.All of us shall agree not
to sell any of our personal holdings of stock until the company shall
be placed upon a dividend-paying basis.Harris,
or both, will return to Colombia immediately to relocate the mine, and
prepare for its development, while the Ketchim Realty Company at once
endeavor to sell the treasury stock."Having delivered himself of this comprehensive plan, Cass settled back
in his chair and awaited remarks."Well," observed Ketchim at length, "that's all right--only, I think
we should be allowed to sell our personal stock if we wish.Of
course," with a deprecating wave of his hand, "there isn't the
slightest likelihood of our ever wanting to do that--with a mine such
as you have described, fellows."Not one dollar's worth of your stock shall you be permitted to sell!"cried Harris, bringing his fist down upon the desk."I suggest that we leave that for the Directors to decide later,"
offered Cass, anxious to avoid discord.He was young, scarcely out of
the twenties, just married, just admitted to the bar, and eager to get
a toe-hold in the world of business."And now," he concluded, "if
agreeable to you, I will put this through at once, organize the
company, and get the charter.You gentlemen will return to Colombia as
soon as Mr.Harris and I have formed an engineering partnership," said Reed."As such, we will handle the affairs of the new company in Colombia.Harris will proceed to that country, while I go to California to
open a copper mine which we have taken over there."I'll send Houghton and Nezlett out on the road to-morrow.Rawlins
has just told me of one prospect, a bully one!We don't need to
wait for the papers from Albany before going ahead.But we find it
costs about forty-eight cents to sell a dollar's worth of stock, and
so some time will be needed to raise enough to send Mr.Harris back
to Colombia--unless," he added, eying Harris furtively, "he will
advance us the amount of his own expenses--"

"Which he will not!""There's a revolution on down there now," said Reed, "and we'd better
go easy for a while.Besides, Harris needs time to study the language.But, are we all agreed on the terms?Salary for Harris while in
Colombia to be settled later, of course.""It's all satisfactory, I think," said Ketchim, smiling happily."The
details can be worked out anon--Molino stockholders' meeting, and so
on.""Then," said Reed, rising, "we will consider the new company launched,
to take over the defunct Molino and to operate on a comprehensive
scale in Colombia, beginning with the development of La Libertad, if
we can secure it."At that moment Rawlins opened the door and peered in.Reed," he announced softly; "a priest, I believe."The door swung open, and Father Waite
entered with Carmen.With a glad cry the girl dropped her bundle and bounded into the arms
of the astonished Harris.Reed grasped the priest's hand, and begged
him to speak.Ketchim and the young lawyer looked on in perplexity."I was unable to find your name in the city directory, Mr.Reed,"
explained the priest, his face beaming with happiness."But at police
headquarters I found that you had made inquiries, and that detectives
were searching for the girl.I learned that you were living with your
wife's sister, and that you had no business address, having just come
up from South America.So I telephoned to your sister-in-law, and your
wife informed me that you had an appointment this morning at this
office.I therefore came directly here with the girl, who, as you see,
is safe and sound, but with an additional interesting experience or
two to add to the large fund she already possessed."He looked down at
Carmen and smiled."And now," he concluded, laughing, as he prepared
to depart, "I will not ask for a receipt for the child, as I see I
have several witnesses to the fact that I have delivered her to the
proper custodian."cried Reed, seizing him by the hand.We
want to know you--"

"I will give you my card," replied the priest."And I would be very
happy, indeed, if some time again I might be permitted to see and talk
with the little girl."He handed his card to Reed; then nodded and
smiled at Carmen and went out.sputtered Harris, pushing the girl aside and making after
him.The priest had already caught a descending
elevator, and disappeared."I
guess that knocks the Simiti Company sky-high," he exclaimed, "for
here is the sole owner of La Libertad!"Ketchim collapsed into a chair, while Reed, saying that he would keep
his dinner engagement with Ketchim on the following day, picked up
Carmen's precious bundle and, taking her hand, left the room."I am
going home," he called back to Harris; "and you be sure to come up to
the house to-night.We'll have to readjust our plans now."CHAPTER 5


"Reed," said Harris the following day, as they sat in the dusty,
creaking car that was conveying them to their dinner appointment with
Ketchim, "who is this Ames that Ketchim referred to yesterday?"The men were not alone, for Carmen accompanied them.Reed was
reluctantly bringing her at the urgent request received from Ketchim
over the telephone the previous evening.But the girl, subdued by the
rush of events since her precipitation into the seething American
world of materialism, sat apart from them, gazing with rapt attention
through the begrimed window at the flying scenery, and trying to
interpret it in the light of her own tenacious views of life and the
universe.If the marvels of this new world into which she had been
thrown had failed to realize her expectations--if she saw in them, and
in the sense of life which they express, something less real, less
substantial, than do those who laud its grandeur and power to
charm--she gave no hint.She was still absorbing, sifting and
digesting the welter of impressions.She had been overpowered,
smothered by the innovation; and she now found her thoughts a tangled
jumble, which she strove incessantly to unravel and classify according
to their content of reality, as judged by her own standards."Why, Ames," replied Reed, turning a watchful eye upon Carmen, "is a
multimillionaire financier of New York--surely you have heard of him!He and his clique practically own the United States, and a large
slice of Europe.For some reason Ames bought a block of Molino stock.And now, I judge, Ketchim would give his chances on eternal life if he
hadn't sold it to him.And that's what's worrying me, too.For, since
Ames is heavily interested in Molino, what will he do to the new
company that absorbs it?""There isn't going to be any new company," asserted Harris doggedly."Ketchim holds us strictly to our
contract.Our negotiations with old Rosendo were made while in the
employ of Molino.It wouldn't be so bad if we had only Ketchim to deal
with.We've got the goods on him and could beat him.But here enters
Ames, a man of unlimited wealth and influence.If he wants La
Libertad, he's going to get it, you mark me!Where we fell down was in
ever mentioning it to Ketchim.For if we don't come over now he will
lay the whole affair before Ames.He told me over the 'phone last
night that he was badly in debt--that Ames was pressing him--that many
of the Molino stockholders were making pertinent inquiries.And yesterday I saw on his desk a letter from
Ames.Ketchim would sacrifice us and
everything else to keep himself out of Ames's grip.We're in for it, I
tell you!And all because we were a bit too previous in believing that
the girl had disappeared for good."exclaimed Harris, "but doesn't it sound like a fairy-tale,
the way Carmen got back to us?""And here I am," continued Reed, with a gesture of vexation, "left
with the girl on my hands, and with a very healthy prospect of losing
out all around.My wife said emphatically last night that she wouldn't
be bothered with Carmen.""But do you realize
that that involves expense?I'm a comparatively poor man, just getting
a start in my profession, and with a young and socially ambitious
wife!""But--your wife--er, she's going to--to have money some day, isn't
she?"But the grim reaper has a little work to do first.And on
occasions like this he's always deucedly deliberate, you know.Meantime, we're skating close to the edge--for New Yorkers.""Well, we may be able to beat Ketchim.Now, my father and Uncle
John--"

"Oh, shoot your father and Uncle John!"The conductor opened the door and bawled a cryptical announcement."This is the place," said Reed, starting up and making for the door."And now you rake your thought for some way to deal with Ketchim.And
leave your father and Uncle John entirely out of the conversation!"Ketchim was just bowing out a caller as the young engineers mounted
the steps.he exclaimed, after giving them a hearty
welcome."I just sold him a hundred shares of Simiti stock, at five
dollars a share--just half of par."But--" protested Harris, as they entered the spacious parlor, "the
company isn't even in existence yet--and hasn't an asset!""Oh, that's all right," replied Ketchim easily."It's coming into
existence, and will have the grandest mine in South America!Boys," he
went on earnestly, "I've been talking over the 'phone with Mr.Ames,
our most influential stockholder, and a very warm friend of mine.I
told him about our conversation of yesterday.He says, go right ahead
with the new company--that it's a great idea.He's satisfied with his
present holding, and will not increase it.Says he wants Molino
stockholders to have the opportunity to purchase all the treasury
stock, if they want to.""Decidedly magnanimous," returned Reed."But--what about the basis of
organization of the new company?""Leave it as we planned it, he says.He thinks the arrangement and
division of stock fine!"Reed and Harris looked at each other questioningly."But," went on Ketchim, "have you seen the morning papers?They are
full of the revolution in Colombia.The country is torn wide open,
and reports say nothing can be done down there until peace is
restored--and that may take a year or two.But, meantime, we will go
ahead and organize the new company and take over Molino and prepare
to begin work just as soon as you fellows can get into that country.And so this," going to
Carmen and taking her hand, "is the wonderful little girl!Ketchim and her troop of children at this
juncture interrupted the conversation."All enthusiastic Simiti
stockholders," said Ketchim, waving his hand toward them, after the
introductions."And all going to get rich out of it, too--as well as
yourselves, boys.It simply shows how Providence works--one with God
is a majority, always."Carmen glanced up at him wonderingly.Dinner over, the men were left alone.Carmen had been taken upstairs
by the children to the nursery."I've got myself slated for the presidency of the new company," said
Ketchim, plunging again into the subject nearest his heart; "and I
think we'd better put brother James in as vice-president.Perfectly
safe," looking at Harris and winking."He's got to be recognized, you
know, since the Ketchim Realty Company act as fiscal agents.Now for
directors I've put down Judge Harris, your father--that's to assure
you boys that there'll be some one to look after your interests.Then
we'll say Reverend Jurges for another.He's got a big congregation and
will be able to place a lot of stock.You just ought to see the letter
he wrote me about selling stock to his people!You'd never believe he
was a good, spiritually-minded clergyman, with an eye single to
heavenly riches!Then one of you fellows, say Reed, had better go on
the directorate, since Harris will be in Colombia in charge of
operations.He's young and immature, but
absolutely square.He'll do all the legal work for his stock interest."But what do I do while we are waiting?"asked Harris in some
perplexity."Reed goes to California right away, you know.""That's all right, old man," Ketchim genially assured him."The new
company will be organized at once--this week, if possible.You go on
salary from the moment of its incorporation, and you open your office
right here in this building.I'll see that the rent is paid until you
go back to Colombia.Everything's arranged, and you turn right in and
help Cass with the new company.You've got
to prepare circulars; write boosting letters to stockholders and
prospects; follow up leads; and--oh, you'll be busy!But here comes
Reverend Coles," looking out of the window as a man came up the steps."He's interested in some projects I've been exploiting.He hastened out to greet the visitor and conducted him into a back
room.Reed and Harris were left to the contemplation of their own
mixed thoughts.Presently Harris, whose eyes had been dilating
for some moments, broke out in a hoarse whisper: "Listen!God
a'mighty!--he's praying!"He got up softly and approached the door of the room into which
Ketchim had taken his caller.In a few minutes he returned to his
chair."I could see Ketchim through the
keyhole, on his knees by the bed, praying with that fellow!Through the silence that fell upon
them snatches of the prayer being offered in the adjoining room
floated to their ears--"O, blessed Saviour, vouchsafe prosperity to
our venture, we beseech thee!The earth is the Lord's, and the
fullness thereof--we ask thy blessing on these efforts of ours to
wrest from the ground the wealth which the Father of lights has
deposited there for the benefit of His children--"

Harris snickered aloud."It may not be a game," he replied."But if it is, it's an old one, hiding behind the mask of religion.But I'm inclined to believe the man sincere."I
know James to be an out-and-out rascal--he openly flies the black
flag.But this pious fellow--well, he's got me guessing!"The caller soon departed, and Ketchim again joined the young men."He's our assistant pastor," he said musingly, as he watched the man
go down the walk."Nice young fellow, waiting for a church.He and
some of his friends are interested in a zinc mine we've been floating,
down in the Joplin district."queried the cynical Harris, with a twinkle in his eyes."Oh, yes," Ketchim smiled affably.Lots of development work to be done, you know.And there's a lot of water in this mine.""And in the stock, too, eh?""We haven't struck the deposit yet, although we expect to soon.But,"
glancing up at the clock on the mantel, "we'll have to be going over
to Sunday school now.And I want that little girl to go with Marjorie.Fellows," the man's face became deeply serious, "I have no doubt you
are both church members?"Reed fidgeted uneasily under Ketchim's searching glance; but Harris
frankly met the question."Nope," he asserted, "we're both rank
heathen.And I'm a dyed-in-the-wool atheist."cried Ketchim, "how can you say that, when you see the
goodness of the Lord on every hand?""Reed, I believe," continued the imperturbable Harris, waving a hand
toward his friend, "has philosophical leanings--New Thought,
Subliminal Consciousness, Power in Silence, and all that."But surely you believe in the divinity of the Christ?""Well, as a matter of fact, I never gave it much thought," said
Harris."Ah, that's what so many say," replied Ketchim sadly; "and then comes
the awful voice of the Lord, 'This night thy soul shall be required of
thee!'Fellows, I want to pray for you; and I want you both to promise
me that you will take up seriously the consideration of your souls'
welfare.It's too grave a subject for jest," addressing himself
solemnly to the grinning Harris."All right, old man," laughed Harris."But don't dig up any
Presbyterian tracts for me.I've got a living witness to--well, to
something out of the ordinary, in that girl, Carmen, and I'm inclined
to believe she's dug nearer to bottom facts than any of you.So when
I'm ready to discuss my soul's welfare I'll just consult her, see?""That reminds me," said Ketchim, turning abruptly to Reed, "what do
you intend to do with the girl?""_Quien sabe?_" Reed answered abstractedly."Send her to a boarding
school, I guess.At least, that's what I told the old man I'd do.""So you said before," Ketchim returned.My daughter Marjorie leaves Tuesday
for Conway-on-the-Hudson, where she has been attending Madam Elwin's
Select School for Girls.Suppose you go with her--I'm too busy,
myself--and take Carmen.It's only a few hours' ride by boat down the
river.This is Marjorie's third year
there, and she's simply in love with it."Reed began to show signs of interest; and Ketchim, noting the effect
of his words, went on briskly:

"Now look here, Molino owes its salvation, and the new company its
existence, to that girl.Why shouldn't they do something to show their
gratitude?I say, it is no more than right that the new company should
support her while she is in school."not a half-bad idea," commented Harris."Certainly not," continued Ketchim earnestly."Now fix up everything
with her as regards the transfer of the mine to the new company, and
then let her go with Marjorie to the Elwin school.We can, if you
like, make some agreement with her to the effect that when the company
is on its feet and she is receiving dividends, she shall return what
it may advance for her schooling, eh?""You'd better accept the suggestion, Reed," put in Harris."I'll be
here, you know, to keep an eye on the girl; and I'll take her and
Marjorie down to Conway myself, and attend to getting her located
right."He was hardly in a position to refuse such
an offer.Besides, he was really leaving her in charge of Harris."Well," he said at length, "in that case I could leave for California
to-morrow night.That matter is pressing hard--all right, I accept the
company's offer.It's no more than is due the girl, anyway.""I'll make the necessary arrangements at
once.Thus it was that two days later Carmen, still wondering if she was
dreaming, was enrolled in the Elwin Select School for Girls, with
Marjorie Ketchim for roommate; while Reed, on the Overland Limited,
hurrying to the far West, was musing dubiously at frequent intervals
on Ketchim's rather conflicting statements, which, until left to this
enforced leisure, he had not had time to try to reconcile.At the same
time, while Harris was loudly declaiming to the gracious Madam Elwin
on the astonishing mental prowess of the girl, Ketchim and Cass sat
deeply immersed in the tentative plans for the newly-projected Simiti
Development Company."Now listen," said Ketchim, who for some minutes had been quietly
scanning his youthful lawyer, "Ames knows nothing about the formation
of this company, but Harris and Reed are not to know that; and we're
going to keep Ames in ignorance of all our plans.With the first sales
of stock--and they've already begun--we'll return him his Molino
investment.Nezlett wired me this morning that he's sure to sell a big
block to the Leveridges, that they're mightily interested, and want to
meet Carmen.We'll use the girl for just such purposes.That's one
reason why I wanted her handy, so's we could reach her at any time.She makes a star impression; and with her as an advertisement we'll
sell a million dollars' worth of stock, and no trouble at all!She's
got that honest look that's convincing.And she can tell a story that
beats the Arabian Nights!Ames has given me a week to explain, or make
good his investment.By that time we'll have the Leveridges sold for
twice his investment, and we'll just pay him off and remove him.Meantime, you go over to the bank in the morning and put up the best
line of talk you're capable of.I've got sixteen hundred dollars to
give 'em on that note; and that'll secure more time, until the sales
of stock are enough to pay it all up.Perhaps Uncle Ted will advance
me enough to take up the note when he hears about La Libertad.And,
say, you see brother James, and shake the club over him until he
disgorges that check he got from Miss Leveridge.You can hand him a
scare that he won't get over.things have taken a
great turn, eh?Why, I can just see Simiti stock sales humping these
next few months.Oh, Miss Honeywell," calling to his cashier, "bring
me five dollars, please, and charge it to Molino--I mean, to Simiti.Then, again addressing Cass: "Come
with me to the football game this afternoon.We can discuss plans
there as well as here.Gee whiz, but I feel great!"CHAPTER 6


Carmen's rapid transition from the eternal solitudes of Guamoco to the
whirring activities of New York was like a plunge into the maelstrom,
and left her groping blindly in the effort to adapt herself to the
changed order.There was little in her former mode of existence that
could be transferred to her new environment, and she felt that she was
starting life like a new-born babe.For days, even weeks, she moved
about dreamily, absorbed, ceaselessly striving to orient herself and
to accept easily and naturally the marvels, the sudden accession of
material aids, and the wonders of this modern, complex civilization,
so common to her associates, but scarcely even dreamed of by her in
her former home, despite the preparation which Jose had tried to give
her.The Elwin school was small, its student-body seldom numbering
more than fifty, and in it Carmen found herself hedged about by
restrictions which in a way were beneficial, in that they narrowed her
environment and afforded her time for her slow adjustment to it.But if these restrictions aided her, they also rendered the length of
her stay in the school almost calculable.Little by little the girl
saw the forces developing which she knew must effect her dismissal;
little by little, as Madam Elwin's manner toward her became less
gracious, and her schoolmates made fewer efforts to conceal from her
the fact that she was not one of them, Carmen prepared for the
inevitable.Six months after the girl's enrollment, Madam Elwin
terminated her series of disparaging reports to Ketchim by a request
that he come at once and remove his charge from the school.Ketchim, the girl is a paradox.And
after these months of disappointing effort to instruct her, I am
forced to throw up my hands in despair and send for you."Madam Elwin
tapped nervously with a dainty finger upon the desk before her."But, if I may be permitted the question, what specific reasons have
you, Madam, for--ah, for requesting her removal?"William Jurges, who, having come up to the city to
attend a meeting of the directors of the Simiti company, had accepted
Ketchim's invitation to first accompany him on his flying trip to
Conway-on-the-Hudson, in response to Madam Elwin's peremptory
summons."Because," replied that worthy personage with a show of exasperation, "I
consider her influence upon the young ladies here quite detrimental.Our school, while non-sectarian, is at least Christian.Where she got her views, I can not imagine.At first she made
frequent mention of a Catholic priest, who taught her in her home town,
in South America.But of late she has grown very reserved--I might say,
sullen, and talks but little.Her views, however, are certainly not
Catholic.She refuses to
accept a large part of our instruction.Her answers to examination
questions are wholly in accord with her peculiar views, and hence quite
apart from the texts.For that reason she fails to make any grades,
excepting in mathematics and the languages.She utterly refuses to
accept any religious instruction whatsoever.She would not be called
atheistic, for she talks--or used to at first--continually about God.But her God is not the God of the Scriptures, Dr.She is a
free-thinker, in the strictest sense.And as such, we can not
consent to her remaining longer with us.""Ah--quite so, Madam, quite so," returned the clergyman, in his
unconsciously pompous manner."Doubtless the child's thought
became--ah--contaminated ere she was placed in your care.But--ah--I
have heard so much from our good friend, Mr.Ketchim, regarding this
young girl, that--ah--I should like exceedingly to see and talk with
her--if it might be--ah--"

"Madam Elwin will arrange that, I am sure," interposed Ketchim."Suppose," he suggested, addressing the lady, "we let him talk with
her, while I discuss with you our recently acquired mine in South
America, and the advisability of an investment with us.""Certainly," acquiesced Madam Elwin, rising and pressing one of the
several buttons in the desk."Bring Miss Carmen," she directed, to the
maid who answered the summons.Jurges; "but may I go to her?Ah--it
would doubtless be less embarrassing for the child.""Miss Carmen was in the chapel a few moments ago," volunteered the
maid."Then take the doctor there," returned Madam Elwin, with a gesture of
dismissal.At the head of the stairway the mingled sounds of a human voice and
the soft, trembling notes of an organ drifted through the long hall
and fell upon the ears of the clergyman."Miss Carmen," said the maid, answering his unspoken thought."She
often comes up to the chapel and sings for hours at a time--alone.The
chapel is down there," pointing to the end of the hall."Then--ah--leave me," said the doctor.The maid turned willingly and went below, while the man tiptoed to
the chapel door.The girl was
singing in Spanish, and he could not understand the words.But they
would have meant nothing to him then.It was the voice upon which
they were borne that held him.The song was a weird lament that had
come down to the children of Simiti from the hard days of the
_Conquistadores_.It voiced the untold wrongs of the Indian slaves;
its sad, unvarying minor echoed their smothered moans under the
cruel goad; on the plaintive melody of the repeated chorus their
piteous cries were carried to heaven's deaf ears; their dull despair
floated up on the wailing tones of the little organ, and then died
away, as died the hope of the innocent victims of Spanish lust.The reverend doctor had never heard a song of that kind before.Nor
could he readily associate the voice, which again and again he could
not distinguish from the flute-like tones of the organ, with the
sordidness and grime of material, fleshly existence.He entered softly
and took a seat in the shadow of a pillar.The clear, sweet voice of
the young girl flowed over him like celestial balm.Some were dreamy bits and snatches in Spanish and English;
others were sacred in character.He wondered deeply, as the girl mused
over these; yet he knew not that they were her own compositions.Curiosity and uncertainty mastered him at length, and he got softly to
his feet and moved away from the pillar, that he might see from what
manner of being issued such unbroken harmony.But in his eagerness his
foot struck a chair, and the sound echoed loudly through the room.The music abruptly ceased, and the girl rose and looked over the organ
at the intruder."I--I beg your pardon," said the clergyman, advancing in some
embarrassment."I was listening to your singing--uninvited, but none
the less appreciative.I--"

"Wait, please!"cried the girl, hastily stooping over and fumbling
with her shoes.The doctor laughed genially, as he grasped the
situation."I took them off," she explained hurriedly."I am not yet accustomed
to them.I never wore shoes until I left Simiti."Her face was
scarlet, and she tried to cover her confusion with a little laugh.The doctor stood staring at her, lost in admiration of the shapely
figure, the heavy, curling hair, and the wonderfully expressive face.The girl quickly recovered her poise and returned him a frank smile.she said, after waiting in vain for him to
begin."Ah--a--yes, certainly--that is, I beg your pardon," stammered the
doctor."I did request permission of Madam Elwin to make your
acquaintance.I am Doctor Jurges, an
Episcopal clergyman."His sentences issued like blasts from an engine
exhaust."I am Carmen Ariza," said the girl, extending her hand."Ah--quite so, quite so," blustered the doctor, clearing his throat
noisily.Ah--ah--you have a remarkable voice.And my poor organ-playing is what I have
picked up myself these six months."The girl looked up into his face searchingly."Why," she asked,
"should every one up here think it remarkable when a human mind is
clear enough to be a transparency for God?"Had the roof fallen, the excellent doctor could have been no more
startled.He cleared his throat violently again; then fumbled
nervously in his pocket and drew out his glasses.These he poised upon
the ample arch of his ecclesiastical nose, and through them turned a
penetrating glance upon the girl.yes," said he at length; "quite so, quite so!And--ah--Miss
Carmen, that brings us to the matter in question--your religious
instruction--ah--may I ask from whom you received it?""From God," was the immediate and frank reply.The clergyman started, but quickly recovered his equipoise.But--your religious views--I believe they are not
considered--ah--quite evangelical, are they?By your present
associates, that is.""No," she replied, with a trace of sadness in her tone."But," looking
up with a queer little smile, "I am not persecuting them for that.""Oh, no," with a jerky little laugh.I judge the
persecution has come from the other side, has it not?""We will not speak of that," she said quickly."They do not
understand--that is all."no, quite so--that is--ah--may I ask why you think they do not
understand?"If that which I believe is not true," the girl replied evenly, "it
will fail under the test of demonstration.Their beliefs have long
since failed under such test--and yet they still cling jealously to
them, and try to force them upon all who disagree with them.I am a
heretic, Doctor.""H'm--ah--yes, I see.But--it is a quite unfortunate characteristic
of mankind to attribute one's views indiscriminately to the
Almighty--and--ah--I regret to note that you are not wholly free from
this error.""You do not understand, I think," she quickly returned."I put every
view, every thought, every idea to the test.If good is the result, I
know that the thought or idea comes from the source of all good, God.The views I hold are those which I have time and again tested--and
some of them have withstood trials which I think you would regard as
unusually severe."Her thought had rested momentarily upon her vivid
experience in Banco, the dangers which had menaced her in distant
Simiti, and the fire through which she had passed in her first hours
in Christian America, the land of churches, sects, and creeds.the worthy doctor mused, regarding the girl first through his
spectacles, and then over the tops of them, while his bushy eyebrows
moved up and down with such comicality that Carmen could scarcely
refrain from laughing.Ah--suppose you relate to me
some of the tests to which your views have been subjected.""No," she returned firmly; "those experiences were only states of
consciousness, which are now past and gone forever.Why go back now and give them the
appearance of reality?"H'm--then you do not regard untoward experience as given us
by God for the testing of our faith, I take it."Carmen turned her head away with a little sigh of weariness."I
think," she said slowly, "I think we had better not talk about these
things, Doctor."Why--ah," blustered the clergyman, assuming a more paternal air,
"we--ah--would not for a moment cause you embarrassment, Miss Carmen!But--in fact, Madam Elwin has--ah--expressed her disapproval of your
views--your religious ideals, if I may put it so baldly, and she--that
is--the good lady regrets--"

"She wishes to be rid of me, you mean, Doctor?"said the girl,
turning and stretching a mental hand to the sinking divine.well, hardly so--ah--so--"

"Doctor," said the girl calmly, "I know it, and I wish to go.I have
been waiting only to see the way open.I do not wish to remain longer
in an atmosphere where ignorance and false belief stifle all real
progress."The doctor turned another look of astonishment upon her.He had
forgotten that he had not been talking with one of his own age.But if her clear mental gaze
penetrated the ecclesiastical mask and surmounted the theological
assumptions of her interlocutor, enabling her to get close to the
heart of the man, she did not indicate it further."I am nearly
sixteen," was her only reply."Ah," he reflected, "just a child!My dear girl," he continued, laying
a hand indulgently upon hers, "I will advise with Madam Elwin, and
will endeavor to convince her that--ah--that your spiritual welfare,
if I may so put it, requires that you be not turned adrift at this
critical, transitorial period of your life.We must all be patient,
while we strive to counteract the--ah--the pernicious teaching to
which you were exposed before--ah--before becoming enrolled in this
excellent school."Carmen looked at him steadily for a moment before replying.There was
something of pity in the expression of her beautiful face, of tender
sympathy for those who seek the light, and who must some day find it,
but whose progress is as yet hampered by the human mind's unreasoning
adherence to the stepping-stones over which it has been passing
through the dark waters of ignorance."Then, Doctor," she said calmly,
"you know what I have been taught?""Why--ah--yes--that is, vaguely.He was beginning to be sensible of having passed judgment upon the
girl without first according her a hearing."Well," she smiled up at him, "I have been taught the very hardest
thing in the whole world."He again clutched at his mental poise.But--ah--is it not the function of all our schools to teach
us to think?""No," answered the girl decidedly; "not to teach us to think, but to
cause us blindly to accept what is ignorantly called 'authority'!I
find we are not to reason, and particularly about religious matters,
but to accept, to let those 'in authority' think for us.Are you not even now seeking to make me accept your religious views?Oh, no; but because you believe them
true--whether they are or not.Do your religious views rest upon anything
but the human mind's undemonstrated interpretation of the Bible?And
yet you can not prove that interpretation true, even though you would
force it upon such as I, who may differ from you.""I--ah--" began the doctor nervously.But Carmen continued without
heeding the interruption:

"Only yesterday Professor Bales, of the University, lectured here on
'The Prime Function of Education.'He said it was the development of
the individual, and that the chief end of educational work was the
promotion of originality.And yet, when I think along original
lines--when I depart from stereotyped formulae, and state boldly that I
will not accept any religion, be it Presbyterian, Methodist, or Roman
Catholic, that makes a God of spirit the creator of a man of flesh, or
that makes evil as real as good, and therefore necessarily created and
recognized by a God who by very necessity can not know evil--then I am
accused of being a heretic, a free-thinker; and the authorities take
steps to remove me, lest my influence contaminate the rest of the
pupils!""H'm--ah--yes, quite so--that is--I think--"

"Do you, a preacher, think?""Or do you
only _think_ that you think?Do you still believe with the world that
the passing of a stream of human thought, or a series of mental
pictures, through your mentality constitutes _real_ thinking?Do you
believe that jumping from one human mental concept to another
twenty-four hours a day constitutes thinking?Have you yet learned to
distinguish between God's thoughts and their opposites, human
thoughts?Have you a real, working,
demonstrable knowledge of Christianity?Do you heal the sick, raise
the dead, and preach the truth that sets men free from the mesmerism
of evil?If so, then you are unevangelical, too, and you and I are
both heretics, and we'd better--we'd better leave this building at
once, for I find that the Inquisition is still alive, even in
America!"Her face was flushed, and her
whole body quivered with emotion.Why, my dear young lady, this is a Christian
nation!""Then," said the girl, "you have still much to learn from the pagan
nations that have gone before."exclaimed the doctor, again adjusting his glasses
that he might see her more clearly."My dear child, you have been
thinking too much, and too seriously.""No, Doctor," she replied; "but you preachers have not been thinking
enough, nor even half seriously.Oh," she went on, while her eyes grew
moist, and ever and again her throat filled, "I had expected so much
in this great country!And I have found so little--so little that is
not wholly material, mechanical, and unreal!I had imagined that, with
all your learning and progress, which Padre Jose told me about, you
would know God much better than we in the darkened South.But your god
is matter, machinery, business, gold, and the unreal things that can
be bought with money.Some one wrote, in a recent newspaper, that
America's god was'mud and mammon!'What do I find the girls here in
this school talking about but dress, and society, and the unreal,
passing pleasures of the physical senses!There are religious services here every
Sunday, and sermons by preachers who come down from the city.Sometimes a Baptist; sometimes a Presbyterian; and sometimes an
Episcopalian, or a Methodist.Each has a different concept of God; yet they all believe
Him the creator of a man of flesh and bones, a man who was originally
made perfect, but who fell, and was then cursed by the good and
perfect God who made him.Oh, what childish views for men to hold and
preach!How could a good God create anything that could fall?And if
He could, and did, then He knew in advance that the man would fall,
and so God becomes responsible, not man.Oh, Doctor, is it possible
that you believe such stuff?Is it any
wonder that, holding such awful views, you preachers have no longer
the power to heal the sick?Do you not know that, in order to heal the
sick, one must become spiritually-minded?But no one who holds to the
puerile material beliefs embraced in your orthodox theology can
possibly be spiritual enough to do the works Jesus said we should all
do if we followed him--really understood him.""My dear child--you really are quite inconsistent--you--"

"Inconsistent!What a charge for an orthodox preacher to bring!Let us
see: You say that the Scriptures teach that God made man in His image
and likeness--the image and likeness of spirit.Spirit,
God, is eternal, immortal.Then while He exists can His image fade
away, or die?Can or would God cause it to do so?Can or would He
destroy His own reflection?And could that image, always being like
Him, ever change, or manifest sin, or disease, or evil, unless God
first manifested these things?And if God did manifest them, then,
perforce, the image would _have_ to do likewise.But, in that case,
could God justly punish His image for faithfully reflecting its
original?Oh, it is you preachers, lacking sufficient
spirituality to correctly interpret the Scriptures, who are wildly,
childishly, ignorantly inconsistent!"Carmen rose and faced the clergyman."I did not mean to condemn
you, Doctor," she said earnestly."I wage no warfare with persons
or things.My opposition is directed only against the entrenched human
thought that makes men spiritually blind and holds them in the
mesmeric chains of evil.I am young, as you reckon years, but I
have had much experience in the realm of thought--and it is there
that all experience is wrought out before it becomes externalized.I have told you, my teacher was God.He used as a channel a priest,
who came years ago to my little home town of Simiti, in far-off
Colombia.His life had been wrecked by holding to the belief of
evil as a power, real and intelligent.He began to see the light; but
he did not overcome fear sufficiently to make his demonstration and
break the imaginary bonds which held him.He saw, but he did not
prove.And, Doctor, you and everybody else will
have to do the same.For, unless Jesus uttered the most malicious
falsehoods ever voiced, every human being will have to take every
step that he took, make every demonstration that he made, and prove
all that he proved, before mortals will cease to consume with
disease, perish miserably in accidents, and sink with broken lives
into graves that do _not_ afford a gateway to immortal life!My God is
infinite, eternal, unchanging mind.The god of the preachers,
judging from their sermons preached here, is a human, mental
concept, embodying spirit and matter, knowing good and evil, and
changing with every caprice of their own unstable mentalities.My
religion is the Christianity of the Master, love.Oh, how this poor
world needs it, yearns for it!The love that demonstrates the
nothingness of evil, and drives it out of human experience!The love
that heals the sick, raises the dead, binds up broken hearts!The
love that will not quench the religious instincts of children, and
falsely educate them to know all manner of evil; but that teaches
them to recognize it for what it is, the lie about God, and then
shows them how to overcome it, even as Jesus did.Then all is spirit and
spirit's manifestation--is it not true?What, then, becomes of the
evil that men hug to their bosoms, even while it gnaws into their
hearts?It is the opposite of good, of mind, of truth, God.And
the opposite of truth is supposition.And you can put it out
whenever you are willing to drop your ceremonials and your theories,
and will open your mentality to truth, which will make you free,
even as the Master said.Those are
the religious views which you have been sent by Madam Elwin to
investigate.She waited a few moments for the doctor to reply.Then, as he remained
silent, she went up to him and held out her hand."You do not care to talk with me longer, I think," she said.But, as regards Madam Elwin's wishes, you may tell
her that I shall leave the school.""Have you--have you been fitting yourself for any--ah--particular
work--ah--for your support, that is?"inquired the doctor gravely, as
he took the proffered hand.He had been swept off his feet by the
girl's conversation, and he had not the temerity to combat her views."I have been working daily to gain a better
understanding of the teachings of Jesus, and through them, of God.My
single aim has been to acquire 'that mind which was in Christ Jesus.'And I have no other business than to reflect it to my fellow-men in a
life of service.That is my Father's business, and I am working with
Him.My mission in this world is to manifest God.I am going out now
to do that, and _to show what love will do_.God will use me, and He
will supply my every need.She turned abruptly from him and went to the organ.Soon the same song
which he had heard as he entered the room rose again through the
stillness.He started toward
the girl; checked himself; and stood hesitating.Then his lips set,
and he turned and walked slowly from the room.In the hall two women were approaching, and as they drew near he
recognized one of them."Why," he exclaimed with enthusiasm, holding out both hands, "my dear
Mrs.It is not so long since we met at the Weston's.But what, may I ask, brings you here?"We have come to,
make a duty call on Mr.Reed's protegee, the little South American
savage, you know.Madam Elwin said she was up here with you?""Ah, yes, quite so--er, in the chapel, I believe," said the clergyman,
his face becoming suddenly grave."I would return with you, but my
time is--ah--so limited."He bowed low, with his hand in the breast of
his long frock coat, and passed on down the hall.As the women approached the door of the chapel through which came
Carmen's low singing they turned and looked at each other inquiringly.Then they quietly entered the doorway and stood listening.Carmen,
concealed behind the organ, did not see them.Hawley-Crowles went quickly to the organ.Bending over it, she gazed down into the face of the startled girl."Get up and let me see what sort of a
looking creature you are."Reed came forward and gave her a tempered
greeting.Hawley-Crowles fell back and stared at the girl
from head to foot."You know," she said to her sister, "this is the
first glimpse I've had of your husband's discovery.I was out of the
city when he brought her to my house, you remember.But," turning
again to Carmen, "sing that song over, dear, please--the one you were
singing just now."Carmen seated herself again at the organ, and Mrs.Hawley-Crowles drew
her sister to the rear of the room."It will sound better back here,"
she explained.After the lapse of a few minutes she turned to Mrs."Belle," she
said, nodding her head sententiously, "you had a pearl, and you threw
it away.Her voice, and her
face--why, with our ward--this beautiful, gifted, South American owner
of a famous mine--as a lever, we can force the Beaubien to bring the
Ames to our terms!Meantime, the dainty Madam Elwin and the amiable Doctor Jurges in the
office below had reached a conclusion."A young lady of--ah--invincible
will," the doctor had observed; "and already--ah--decidedly mature,
despite her tender years.Should she--ah--assume leadership over the
pupils of your school, my dear Madam Elwin, the result might be
disquieting.There can be no question as to her religious views, as I
have said.But, what astonishes me is--ah--that this strange cult
should have its devotees even in the wilds of tropical America!The girl is utterly--ah--unevangelical,
Madam; and the advisability of removing her from the school can not be
questioned."By all means," asserted the latter gentleman with great seriousness,
while his eyes dwelt tenderly upon Madam Elwin's written order for a
hundred shares of Simiti stock which he held in his hand."Very well, then," said the lady with a determined nod of her head; "I
shall request Mrs.Then, with a proper sense
of what it meant to have the moral support of such an eminent divine
as Doctor Jurges, she rang for her maid and bade her summon Mrs.Thus it was that Carmen was again shifted a space on the checkerboard
of life, and slept that night once more under the spacious roof of the
wealthy relict of the late James Hawley-Crowles, on Riverside Drive.CHAPTER 7


As has been said, Carmen's six months in the Elwin school had been a
period of slow adjustment to the changed order.She had brought into
this new world a charm of unsophistication, an ingenuous _naivete_,
such as only an untrammeled spirit nourished in an elemental
civilization like that of primitive Simiti could develop.Added to
this was the zest and eagerness stimulated by the thought that she had
come as a message-bearer to a people with a great need.Her first
emotion had been that of astonishment that the dwellers in the great
States were not so different, after all, from those of her own
unprogressive country.Her next was one of sad disillusionment, as the
fact slowly dawned upon her trusting thought that the busy denizens of
her new environment took no interest whatsoever in her message.And
then her joy and brilliant hopefulness had chilled, and she awoke to
find her strange views a barrier between herself and her associates.She had brought to the America of the North a spirit so deeply
religious as to know naught else than her God and His ceaseless
manifestation.She had come utterly free of dogma or creed, and
happily ignorant of decaying formularies and religious caste.Her
Christianity was her demonstrable interpretation of the Master's
words; and her fresh, ebulliant spirit soared unhampered in the warm
atmosphere of love for mankind.Her concept of the Christ stirred no
thought within her of intolerance toward those who might hold
differing views; nor did it raise interposing barriers within her own
mind, nor evoke those baser sentiments which have so sadly warped the
souls of men into instruments of deadly hatred and crushing tyranny.Her spiritual vision, undimmed and world-embracing, saw the advent of
that day when all mankind would obey the commands of Jesus, and do the
works which he did, even to the complete spiritualization and
dematerializing of all human thought.And her burning desire was to
hasten the coming of that glad hour.The conviction that, despite its tremendous needs, humanity was
steadily rejecting, even in this great land of opportunity and
progress, the remedy for its consuming ills, came to her slowly.And
with it a damping of her ardor, and a dulling of the fine edge of her
enthusiasm.She grew quiet as the days passed, and drew away from her
companions into her thought.With her increasing sense of isolation
came at length a great longing to leave these inhospitable shores, and
return to her native environment and the sympathy and tender
solicitude of her beloved Rosendo and Padre Jose.Indeed, she could not be certain now of their
whereabouts.A great war was raging in Colombia, and she knew not what
fate had befallen her loved ones.To her many letters directed to
Simiti there had come back no reply.Even Harris, who had written
again and again to both Rosendo and Jose, had received no word from
them in return.Corroding fear began to assail the girl; soul-longing
and heart-sickness seized upon her; her happy smile faded; and her
bright, bubbling conversation ceased.Then one day, standing alone in her room, she turned squarely upon the
foul brood of evil suggestions crowding upon her and, as if they were
fell spirits from the nether world, bade them begone."I know you for what you are--_nothing_!You seemed to
use Padre Jose, but you can't use me!He is my life; and you, evil thoughts, can't make me think He isn't!I
am His image and likeness; I am His witness; and I will _not_ witness
to His opposite, evil!My life is filled with harmony; and you, evil
thoughts, can't reverse that fact!God has brought me here, else I
would not have come, for He is the cause of all that is.It is for me
to stand and see His glory.as she paced about the room and
seemed to ward off the assaults of an invisible enemy, "there is no
power apart from Him!Then, in the lull of battle, "Father divine, I thank Thee that Thou
hast heard me.And now I lay my all upon the altar of love, and throw
myself upon Thy thought."From that day, despite continued attacks from error--despite, too, the
veiled slights and covert insinuations of her schoolmates, to whom the
girl's odd views and utter refusal to share their accustomed
conversation, their interest in mundane affairs, their social
aspirations and worldly ambitions, at length made her quite
unwelcome--Carmen steadily, and without heed of diverting gesture,
brought into captivity every thought to the obedience of her
Christ-principle, and threw off for all time the dark cloud of
pessimism which human belief and the mesmerism of events had drawn
over her joyous spirit.Reed had not been near her since her enrollment in the school;
but Ketchim had visited her often--not, however, alone, but always
with one or more prospective purchasers of Simiti stock in tow whom
he sought to influence favorably through Carmen's interesting
conversation about her native land.Harris came every Sunday, and
the girl welcomed the great, blundering fellow as the coming of the
day.At times he would obtain Madam Elwin's permission to take the
girl up to the city on a little sight-seeing expedition, and then he
would abandon himself completely to the enjoyment of her naive wonder
and the numberless and often piquant questions stimulated by it.He
was the only one now with whom she felt any degree of freedom, and
in his presence her restraint vanished and her airy gaiety again
welled forth with all its wonted fervor.Once, shortly after Carmen
had been enrolled, Harris took her to a concert by the New York
Symphony Orchestra.But in the midst of the program, after sitting
in silent rapture, the girl suddenly burst into tears and begged to be
taken out.she sobbed as, outside the door,
she hid her tear-stained face in his coat; "I just couldn't!Oh, it was God that we heard--it was God!"And the
astonished fellow respected this sudden outburst of pent-up emotion
as he led her, silent and absorbed, back to the school.With the throwing of the girl upon her own thought came a rapid
expansion of both mind and body into maturity, and the young lady who
left the Elwin school that bright spring afternoon under the
protection of the self-sufficient Mrs.Hawley-Crowles was very far
from being the inquisitive, unabashed little girl who had so
greatly shocked the good Sister Superior by her heretical views
some six months before.The sophistication engendered by her
intercourse with the pupils and instructors in the school had
transformed the eager, trusting little maid, who could see only good
into a mature woman, who, though her trust remained unshaken,
nevertheless had a better understanding of the seeming power "that
lusteth against the spirit," and whose idea of her mission had been
deepened into a grave sense of responsibility.She saw now, as never
before, the awful unreality of the human sense of life; but she
likewise understood, as never previously, its seeming reality in
the human consciousness, and its terrible mesmeric power over
those materialistic minds into which the light of spirituality had as
yet scarcely penetrated.Her thought had begun to shape a definite
purpose; she was still to be a message-bearer, but the message must be
set forth in her life conduct.The futility of promiscuous verbal
delivery of the message to whomsoever might cross her path had
been made patent.She must do
likewise, and let her deeds attest the truth of her words.And from
the day that she bade the suggestions of fear and evil leave her,
she had consecrated herself anew to a searching study of the
Master's life and words, if happily she might acquire "that mind"
which he so wondrously expressed.But the assumption of an attitude of quiet demonstration was by no
means sudden.There were times when she could not restrain the impulse
to challenge the beliefs so authoritatively set forth by the preachers
and lecturers whom Madam Elwin invited to address her pupils, and who,
unlike Jesus, first taught, and then relegated their proofs to a life
beyond the grave.Once, shortly after entering the school, forgetful
of all but the error being preached, she had risen in the midst of an
eloquent sermon by the eminent Darius Borwell, a Presbyterian divine
of considerable repute, and asked him why it was that, as he seemed to
set forth, God had changed His mind after creating spiritual man, and
had created a man of dust.She had later repented her scandalous
conduct in sackcloth and ashes; but it did not prevent her from
abruptly leaving the chapel on a subsequent Sunday when another
divine, this time a complaisant Methodist, quite satisfied with his
theories of endless future rewards and fiery punishments, dwelt at
length upon the traditional idea that the sorrows of the world are
God-sent for mankind's chastisement and discipline.Then she gradually learned to be less defiant of the conventions and
beliefs of the day, and determined quietly to rise superior to them.But her experience with the preachers wrought within her a strong
determination henceforth to listen to no religious propaganda
whatsoever, to give no further heed to current theological beliefs,
and to enter no church edifice, regardless of the tenets of the sect
worshiping within its precincts.The wisdom of this decision she left
for the future to determine."Oh," she cried, "my only mission is to manifest the divine, not to
waste time listening to the theories of ignorant preachers, who fail
utterly to prove the truth of their teachings!Oh, how the world needs
love--just love!And I am going to love it with the selfless love that
comes from God, and destroys error and the false beliefs that become
externalized in the human consciousness as sickness, failure, old
age, and death!Love, love, love--it is mankind's greatest need!Why,
if the preachers only knew, the very heart and soul of Christianity is
love!It is love that casts out fear; and fear is at the bottom of all
sickness, for fear leads to belief in other gods than the one Father
of Christ Jesus!Oh, God--take me
out into the world, and let me show it what love can do!"And the divine ear heard the call of this beautiful disciple of the
Christ--aye, had heard it long before the solicitous, fluttering
little Madam Elwin decided that the strange girl's unevangelical views
were inimical to the best interests of her very select school.Hawley-Crowles threw wide the
portals of the world to Carmen, and she entered, wide-eyed and
wondering.Nor did she return until the deepest recesses of the human
mind had revealed to her their abysmal hideousness, their ghastly
emptiness of reality, and their woeful mesmeric deception.James Hawley-Crowles, more keenly perceptive than her sister, had
seized upon Carmen with avidity bred of hope long deferred.The
scourge of years of fruitless social striving had rendered her
desperate, and she would have staged a ballet on her dining table,
with her own ample self as _premiere danseuse_, did the attraction but
promise recognition from the blase members of fashionable New York's
ultra-conservative set.From childhood she had looked eagerly forward
through the years with an eye single to such recognition as life's
desideratum.To this end she had bartered both youth and beauty with
calculated precision for the Hawley-Crowles money bags; only to weep
floods of angry tears when the bargain left her social status
unchanged, and herself tied to a decrepit old rounder, whose tarnished
name wholly neutralized the purchasing power of his ill-gotten gold.Fortunately for the reputations of them both, her husband had the good
sense to depart this life ere the divorce proceedings which she had
long had in contemplation were instituted; whereupon the stricken
widow had him carefully incinerated and his ashes tenderly deposited
in a chaste urn in a mausoleum which her architect had taken oath cost
more than the showy Ames vault by many thousands.The period of
decorous mourning past, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles blithely doffed her weeds
and threw herself again into the terrific competition for social
standing, determined this time that it should be a warfare to the
death.And so it bade fair to prove to her, when the eminent nerve
specialist, Dr.Bascom Ross, giving a scant half hour to the
consideration of her case, at the modest charge of one hundred
dollars, warned her to declare a truce and flee to the Alps for
unalloyed rest.She complied, and had returned with restored health
and determination just as her sister came up from South America,
bringing the odd little "savage" whom Reed had discovered in the wilds
of Guamoco.A prolonged week-end at Newport, the last of the summer
season, accounted for her absence from the city when Reed brought
Carmen to her house, where he and his wife were making their temporary
abode.Six months later, in her swift appraisal of the girl in the
Elwin school, to whom she had never before given a thought, she seemed
to see a light."It does look like a desperate chance, I admit," she said, when
recounting her plans to her sister a day or so later."But I've played
every other card in my hand; and now this girl is going to be either a
trump or a joker.All we need is a word from the Beaubien, and the
following week will see an invitation at our door from Mrs.The trick is to reach the Beaubien.And I'm going to introduce the girl as an Inca
princess.Reed was not less ambitious than her sister, but hitherto she had
lacked the one essential to social success, money.In addition, she
had committed the egregious blunder of marrying for love.And now that
the honeymoon had become a memory, and she faced again her growing
ambition, with a struggling husband who had neither name nor wealth to
aid her, she had found her own modest income of ten thousand a year,
which she had inherited from her mother, only an aggravation.True, in
time her wandering father would pass away; and there was no doubt that
his vast property would fall to his daughters, his only living kin.But at present, in view of his aggressively good health and disregard
for his relatives, her only recourse was to attach herself to her
wealthy, sharp-witted sister, and hope to be towed safely into the
social swim, should that scheming lady ultimately achieve her high
ambition.Hawley-Crowles should have seen in Carmen a means of
reaching a woman of the stamp of the Beaubien, and through her the
leader of the most exclusive social set in the metropolis, is
difficult to say.But thus does the human mind often seek to further
its own dubious aims through guileless innocence and trust.Hawley-Crowles had likewise a slight trace of that clairvoyance
of wisdom which so characterized the girl.But with this difference,
that she knew not why she was led to adopt certain means; while
Carmen, penetrating externals, consciously sought to turn those who
would employ her into channels for the expression of her own dominant
thought.Be that as it may, the Beaubien was now the stone before the
door of their hope, and Carmen the lever by which these calculating
women intended it should be moved."The Beaubien, my dear," explained Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to her
inquisitive sister, whose life had been lived almost entirely away
from New York, "is J. Wilton Ames's very particular friend, of long
standing.As I told you, I have recently been going through my late
unpleasant husband's effects, and have unearthed letters and memoranda
which throw floods of light upon Jim's early indiscretions and his
association with both the Beaubien and Ames.Jim once told me, in a
burst of alcoholic confidence, that she had saved him from J. Wilton's
clutches in the dim past, and for that he owed her endless gratitude,
as well as for never permitting him to darken her door again.Now I
have never met the Beaubien.But I dare say she knows
all about us.However, the point that concerns us now is this: she has
a hold on Ames, and, unless rumor is wide of the truth, when she hints
to him that his wife's dinner list or yachting party seems incomplete
without such or such a name, why, the list is immediately revised."The position which the Beaubien held was, if Madam On-dit was not to
be wholly discredited, to say the least, unique.It was not as social
dictator that she posed, for in a great cosmopolitan city where polite
society is infinitely complex in its make-up such a position can
scarcely be said to exist.It was rather as an influence that she was
felt, an influence never seen, but powerful, subtle, and wholly
inexplicable, working now through this channel, now through that, and
effecting changes in the social complexion of conservative New York
that were utterly in defiance of the most rigid convention.Particularly was her power felt in the narrow circle over which Mrs.J. Wilton Ames presided, by reason of her own and her husband's
aristocratic descent, and the latter's bursting coffers and supremacy
in the realm of finance.Only for her sagacity, the great influence of the woman would have
been short-lived.But, whatever else might be said of her, the
Beaubien was wise, with a discretion that was positively uncanny.Tall, voluptuous, yet graceful as a fawn; black, wavy, abundant hair;
eyes whose dark, liquid depths held unfathomable mysteries; gracious,
affable, yet keen as a razor blade; tender, even sentimental on
occasions, with an infinite capacity for either love or hate, this
many-sided woman, whose brilliant flashes of wit kept the savant or
roue at her table in an uproar, could, if occasion required, found an
orphanage or drop a bichloride tablet in the glass of her rival with
the same measure of calculating precision and disdain of the future.It was said of her that she might have laid down her life for the man
she loved.It is probable that she never met with one worth the
sacrifice.While yet in short dresses she had fled from her boarding school, near
a fashionable resort in the New Hampshire hills, with a French
Colonel, Gaspard de Beaubien, a man twice her age.With him she had
spent eight increasingly miserable years in Paris.Then, her withered
romance carefully entombed in the secret places of her heart, she
secured a divorce from the roistering colonel, together with a small
settlement, and set sail for New York to hunt for larger and more
valuable game.With abundant charms and sang-froid for her capital, she rented an
expensive apartment in a fashionable quarter of the city, and then
settled down to business.Whether she would have fallen upon bad days
or not will never be known, for the first haul of her widespread net
landed a fish of supreme quality, J. Wilton Ames.On the plea of
financial necessity, she had gone boldly to his office with the deed
to a parcel of worthless land out on the moist sands of the New Jersey
shore, which the unscrupulous Gaspard de Beaubien had settled upon her
when she severed the tie which bound them, and which, after weeks of
careful research, she discovered adjoined a tract owned by Ames.Pushing aside office boy, clerk, and guard, she reached the inner
_sanctum_ of the astonished financier himself and offered to sell at a
ruinous figure.A few well-timed tears, an expression of angelic
innocence on her beautiful face, a despairing gesture or two with her
lovely arms, coupled with the audacity which she had shown in forcing
an entrance into his office, effected the man's capitulation.She was
then in her twenty-fourth year.The result was that she cast her net no more, but devoted herself
thenceforth with tender consecration to her important catch.In time
Ames brought a friend, the rollicking James Hawley-Crowles, to call
upon the charming Beaubien.In time, too, as was perfectly natural, a
rivalry sprang up between the men, which the beautiful creature
watered so tenderly that the investments which she was enabled to make
under the direction of these powerful rivals flourished like Jack's
beanstalk, and she was soon able to leave her small apartment and take
a suite but a few blocks from the Ames mansion.At length the strain between Ames and Hawley-Crowles reached the
breaking point; and then the former decided that the woman's
bewitching smiles should thenceforth be his alone.He forthwith drew
the seldom sober Hawley-Crowles into certain business deals, with the
gentle connivance of the suave Beaubien herself, and at length sold
the man out short and presented a claim on every dollar he possessed.Hawley-Crowles awoke from his blissful dream sober and trimmed.But
then the Beaubien experienced one of her rare and inexplicable
revulsions of the ethical sense, and a compromise had to be effected,
whereby the Hawley-Crowles fortune was saved, though the man should
see the Beaubien no more.By this time her beauty was blooming in its utmost profusion, and her
prowess had been fairly tried.She took a large house, furnished it
like unto a palace, and proceeded to throw her gauntlet in the face of
the impregnable social caste.There she drew about her a circle of
bon-vivants, artists, litterateurs, politicians, and men of
finance--with never a woman in the group.Yet in her new home she
established a social code as rigid as the Median law, and woe to him
within her gates who thereafter, with or without intent, passed the
bounds of respectful decorum.His name was heard no more on her rosy
lips.Her dinners were Lucullan in their magnificence; and over the rare
wines and imperial cigars which she furnished, her guests passed many
a tip and prognostication anent the market, which she in turn quietly
transmitted to her brokers.She came to understand the game
thoroughly, and, while it was her heyday of glorious splendor, she
played hard.She had bartered every priceless gift of nature for
gold--and she made sure that the measure she received in return was
full.Her gaze was ever upon the approaching day when those charms
would be but bitter memories; and it was her grim intention that when
it came silken ease should compensate for their loss.Ten years passed, and the Beaubien's reign continued with undimmed
splendor.In the meantime, the wife of J. Wilton Ames had reached the
zenith of her ambitions and was the acknowledged leader in New York's
most fashionable social circle.But, though
the Beaubien had never sought the entree to formal society, preferring
to hold her own court, at which no women attended, she exercised a
certain control over it through her influence upon the man Ames.Ames knew of the long-continued relations between her husband and
this woman was never divulged.And doubtless she was wholly satisfied
that his wealth and power afforded her the position which her heart
had craved; and, that secure, she was willing to leave him to his own
methods of obtaining diversion.But rumor was persistent, maliciously
so; and rumor declared that the list of this envied society dame was
not drawn up without the approval of her husband and the woman with
whom his leisure hours were invariably spent.Hawley-Crowles, whose doting mate had once fawned in the perfumed wake
of the luxurious Beaubien.Carmen, whose wishes had not been consulted, had voiced no objection
whatever to returning to the Hawley-Crowles home.Indeed, she secretly
rejoiced that an opportunity had been so easily afforded for escape
from the stifling atmosphere of the Elwin school, and for entrance
into the great world of people and affairs, where she believed the
soil prepared for the seed she would plant.That dire surprises
awaited her, of which she could not even dream, did not enter her
calculations.Secure in her quenchless faith, she gladly accepted the
proffered shelter of the Hawley-Crowles mansion, and the protection of
its worldly, scheming inmates.In silent, wide-eyed wonder, in the days that followed, the girl
strove to accustom herself to the luxury of her surroundings, and to
the undreamed of marvels which made for physical comfort and
well-being.Hawley-Crowles settled upon her seemed a fortune--enough, she thought,
to buy the whole town of Simiti!Her gowns seemed woven on fairy
looms, and often she would sit for hours, holding them in her lap and
reveling in their richness.Then, when at length she could bring
herself to don the robes and peep timidly into the great pier glasses,
she would burst into startled exclamations and hide her face in her
hands, lest the gorgeous splendor of the beautiful reflection
overpower her."Oh," she would exclaim, "it can't be that the girl reflected there
ever lived and dressed as I did in Simiti!I wonder, oh, I wonder if
Padre Jose knew that these things were in the world!"And then, as she leaned back in her chair and gave herself into the
hands of the admiring French maid, she would close her eyes and dream
that the fairy-stories which the patient Jose had told her again and
again in her distant home town had come true, and that she had been
transformed into a beautiful princess, who would some day go in search
of the sleeping priest and wake him from his mesmeric dream.Then would come the inevitable thought of the little newsboy of
Cartagena, to whom she had long since begun to send monetary
contributions--and of her unanswered letters--of the war devastating
her native land--of rudely severed ties, and unimaginable changes--and
she would start from her musing and brush away the gathering tears,
and try to realize that her present situation and environment were but
means to an end, opportunities which her God had given her to do His
work, with no thought of herself.A few days after Carmen had been installed in her new home, during
which she had left the house only for her diurnal ride in the big
limousine, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles announced her readiness to fire the
first gun in the attack upon the Beaubien."My dear," she said to her
sister, as they sat alone in the luxurious sun-parlor, "my washerwoman
dropped a remark the other day which gave me something to build on.Her two babies are in the General Orphan Asylum, up on Twenty-third
street.Well, it happens that this institution is the Beaubien's sole
charity--in fact, it is her particular hobby.I presume that she feels
she is now a middle-aged woman, and that the time is not far distant
when she will have to close up her earthly accounts and hand them over
to the heavenly auditor.Anyway, this last year or two she has
suddenly become philanthropic, and when the General Orphan Asylum was
building she gave some fifty thousand dollars for a cottage in her
name.What's more, the trustees of the Asylum accepted it without the
wink of an eyelash."But here's the point: some rich old fellow has willed the institution
a fund whose income every year is used to buy clothing for the
kiddies; and they have a sort of celebration on the day the duds are
given out, and the public is invited to inspect the place and the
inmates, and eat a bit, and look around generally.Well, my
washerwoman tells me that the Beaubien always attends these annual
celebrations.The next one, I learn, comes in about a month.I propose
that we attend; take Carmen; ask permission for her to sing to the
children, and thereby attract the attention of the gorgeous Beaubien,
who will be sure to speak to the girl, who is herself an orphan, and,
ten to one, want to see more of her.I'll have a
word to say regarding our immense debt of gratitude to her for saving
Jim's fortune years ago when he was entangled in her net--and, well,
if that scheme doesn't work, I have other strings to my bow."But it did work, and with an ease that exceeded the most sanguine
hopes of its projector.On the day that the General Orphan Asylum
threw wide its doors to the public, the Hawley-Crowles limousine
rubbed noses with the big French car of the Beaubien in the street
without; while within the building the Beaubien held the hand of the
beautiful girl whose voluntary singing had spread a veil of silence
over the awed spectators in the great assembly room, and, looking
earnestly down into the big, trusting, brown eyes, said: "My dear
child, I want to know you."Then, turning to the eager, itching Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "I shall send my car for her to-morrow afternoon, with
your permission."Hawley-Crowles wildly hugged her
sister and the girl all the way home--then went to bed that night with
tears of apprehension in her washed-out eyes, lest she had shown
herself too eager in granting the Beaubien's request.But her fears
were turned to exultation when the Beaubien car drew up at her door
the following day at three, and the courteous French chauffeur
announced his errand.A few moments later, while the car glided
purring over the smooth asphalt, Carmen, robed like a princess, lay
back in the cushions and dreamed of the poor priest in the dead little
town so far away.CHAPTER 9


"Sing it again, dear.I know you are tired, but I want to hear that
song just once more.Somehow it seems to bring up thoughts of--of
things that might have been."The Beaubien's voice sank to a whisper
as she finished.Carmen laughed happily and prepared to repeat the weird lament which
had so fascinated the Reverend Doctor Jurges a few days before."I--I don't know why that song affects me so," mused the Beaubien,
when the girl had finished and returned to the seat beside her.Then,
abruptly: "I wish you could play the pipe-organ out in the hall.I put
twelve thousand dollars into it, and I can't even play five-finger
exercises on it."exclaimed Carmen, drawing a long breath,
while her eyes dilated."Well, you poor, unsophisticated girl, suppose we just go down there
and buy the whole town.It would at least give me an interest in life.Do you think I could stand the heat there?How did you live, and what did you do?And are
you really descended from the old Incas?"They were alone in the darkened music room, and the soft-stepping,
liveried butler had just set the tea table before them, At one end of
the long room a cheery fire snapped and crackled in the huge
fireplace, tempering the sharpness of the early spring day and casting
a ruddy glow upon the tapestried walls and polished floor in front,
where dozed the Beaubien's two "babies," Japanese and Pekingese
spaniels of registered pedigree and fabulous value.Among the heavy
beams of the lofty ceiling grotesque shadows danced and flickered,
while over the costly rugs and rare skins on the floor below subdued
lights played in animated pantomime.Behind the magnificent grand
piano a beautifully wrought harp reflected a golden radiance into the
room.Everything in the woman's environment was softened into the same
degree of voluptuousness which characterized her and the life of
sybaritic ease which she affected.From the moment Carmen entered the house she had been charmed,
fascinated, overpowered by the display of exhaustless wealth and
the rich taste exhibited in its harmonious manifestation.The
Hawley-Crowles home had seemed to her the epitome of material
elegance and comfort, far exceeding the most fantastic concepts of her
childish imagination, when she had listened enraptured to Padre
Jose's compelling stories of the great world beyond Simiti.But the
gorgeous web of this social spider made even the Hawley-Crowles
mansion suffer in comparison."And yet," said the amused Beaubien, when Carmen could no longer
restrain her wonder and admiration, "this is but a shed beside the new
Ames house, going up on Fifth Avenue.I presume he will put not less
than ten millions into it before it is finished."Carmen dared not attempt to grasp the
complex significance of such an expenditure."Why, is that such a huge amount, child?"asked the Beaubien, as
accustomed to think in eight figures as in two."But, I forget that
you are from the jungle.she mused, gazing
with undisguised admiration at the beautiful, animated girl before
her.Carmen was struggling with the
deluge of new impressions; and the woman fastened her eyes upon her as
if she would have them bore deep into the soul of whose rarity she was
becoming slowly aware.What thoughts coursed through the mind of the
Beaubien as she sat studying the girl through the tempered light, we
may not know.What she saw in Carmen that attracted her, she herself
might not have told.Had she, too, this ultra-mondaine, this creature
of gold and tinsel, felt the spell of the girl's great innocence and
purity of thought, her righteousness?Or did she see in her something
that she herself might once have been--something that all her gold,
and all the wealth of Ormus or of Ind could never buy?"What have you got," she suddenly, almost rudely, exclaimed, "that I
haven't?"And then the banality of the question struck her, and she
laughed harshly."Why," said Carmen, looking up quickly and beaming upon the woman,
"you have everything!"You," returned the woman quickly, though she knew not why she said
it.And yet, memory was busy uncovering those bitter days when, in the
first agony of marital disappointment, she had, with hot, streaming
tears, implored heaven to give her a child.But the gift had been
denied; and her heart had shrunk and grown heavily calloused.Then she spoke more gently, and there was that in her voice which
stirred the girl's quick sympathy."Yes, you have youth, and beauty.But I could part with them, gladly, if only
there were anything left."Carmen instantly rose and went swiftly to her.Forgetful of caste,
decorum, convention, everything but the boundless love which she felt
for all mankind, she put her arms about the worldly woman's neck and
kissed her.For a moment the Beaubien sat in speechless surprise.It was the only
manifestation of selfless love that had ever come into her sordid
experience.that it was an
act of real sympathy, and not a clever ruse to win her from behind the
mask of affection?Her own kisses, she knew, were bestowed only for
favors.they drew not many now, although time was when a single
one might win a brooch or a string of pearls.The girl herself quickly met the woman's groping thought."I'm in the
world to show what love will do," she murmured; "and I love you."Had
she not thus solved every problem from earliest childhood?Not even a heart of stone could withstand the
solvent power of such love.Her head dropped upon her breast, and she
wept."Don't cry," said Carmen, tenderly caressing the bepowdered cheek."Why, we are all God's children; we all have one another; you have me,
and I have you; and God means us all to be happy."The Beaubien looked up, wondering.Her variegated life included no
such tender experience as this.She had long since ceased to shed
aught but tears of anger.But now--

She clutched the girl to her and kissed her eagerly; then gently
motioned her back to her chair."Don't mind it," she smiled, with
swimming eyes, and a shade of embarrassment."I don't know of anything
that would help me as much as a good cry.If I could have had a
daughter like you, I should--but never mind now."She tried to laugh,
as she wiped her eyes.Then an idea seemed to flash through her jaded brain, and she became
suddenly animated."Why--listen," she said; "don't you want to learn
the pipe-organ?I will pay for
them; I will engage the best teacher in New York; and you shall take
two or three a week, and use the big organ out in the hall.Carmen's heart gave a great leap."I'll do it myself," returned the woman with growing enthusiasm."William," she directed, when the butler responded to her summons,
"get Mrs.Hawley-Crowles on the wire at once.But who is coming, I
wonder?"glancing through the window at an automobile that had drawn
up at her door.a look of vexation mantling her face, "the
Right Reverend Monsignor Lafelle.Well," turning to Carmen, "I suppose
I'll have to send you home now, dear.Hawley-Crowles
that I shall call for you to-morrow afternoon, and that I shall speak
to her at that time about your music lessons.William, take Monsignor
into the morning room, and then tell Henri to bring the car to the
porte-cochere for Miss Carmen.Good-bye, dear," kissing the bright,
upturned face of the waiting girl."I wish I could--but, well, don't
forget that I'm coming for you to-morrow."Hawley-Crowles directed her French tailor to cable
to Paris for advance styles.Twenty-four hours later she hastened with
outstretched arms to greet the Beaubien, waiting in the reception
room.Oh, yes, they had heard often of each other; and now were so
pleased to meet!New York was such a whirlpool, and it was so
difficult to form desirable friendships.Yes, the Beaubien had known
the late-lamented Hawley-Crowles; but, dear!that was years and
years ago, before he had married, and when they were both young and
foolish.Hawley-Crowles, chance enabled him and me to be mutually
helpful at a time when I was in sore need of a friend; and the debt of
gratitude is not yours to me, but mine to your kind husband."Hawley-Crowles could have hugged her on the spot.What cared she
that her husband's always unsavory name had been linked with this
woman's?She had married the roistering blade for his bank account
only.Any other male whose wealth ran into seven figures would have
done as well, or better.Hawley-Crowles gratefully
accepted the use of the organ and the Beaubien mansion for the girl;
but she herself insisted upon bearing the expense of the lessons.Together, she and the Beaubien,
they would foster and develop it.Moreover, though of course this must
follow later, she intended to give the girl every social advantage
befitting her beauty, her talents, and her station.And then, when the Beaubien, who knew to a second just how long to
stay, had departed, taking Carmen with her, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles turned
to her sister with her face flushed with anger.she exclaimed, while hot tears suffused her eyes."The hussy went away
actually laughing at me!What do you suppose she's got up her sleeve?But, let me tell you, she'll not fool me!I'll slap that arrogant Ames
woman yet; and then, when I've done that, I'll give the Beaubien
something to think about besides the way she did up poor old Jim!"*       *       *       *       *

There was now but one cloud that cast its dark shadow across the full
splendor of Carmen's happiness, the silence that shrouded Simiti.But
Harris was preparing to return to Colombia, and his trip promised a
solution of the mystery of her unanswered letters.For weeks Carmen
had struggled to teach him Spanish, with but small measure of success."You'll have to go back with me and
act as interpreter," he said one day, when they were alone in the
Hawley-Crowles parlor.Then a curious light came into his eyes, and he
blurted, "Will you?"But the girl turned the question aside with a laugh, though she knew
not from what depths it had sprung.Harris shrugged his broad
shoulders and sighed.He had not a hundred dollars to his name.Yet he had prospects, not the least of which was the interest he
shared with Reed in La Libertad.For, despite the disturbed state of
affairs in Colombia, Simiti stock had sold rapidly, under the sedulous
care of Ketchim and his loyal aids, and a sufficient fund had been
accumulated to warrant the inauguration of development work on the
mine.A few years hence Harris should be rich from that source alone.Reed was still in California, although the alluring literature which
Ketchim was scattering broadcast bore his name as consulting engineer
to the Simiti Development Company.His wife had continued her
temporary abode in the Hawley-Crowles mansion, while awaiting with
what fortitude she could command the passing of her still vigorous
father, and the results of her defiant sister's assaults upon the Ames
set.The wonderful organ in the Beaubien
mansion had cast a spell of enchantment over her soul, and daily she
sat before it, uncovering new marvels and losing herself deeper and
deeper in its infinite mysteries.Her progress was commensurate with
her consecration, and brought exclamations of astonishment to the lips
of her now devoted Beaubien.Hour after hour the latter would sit in
the twilight of the great hall, with her eyes fastened upon the
absorbed girl, and her leaden soul slowly, painfully struggling to
lift itself above the murk and dross in which it had lain buried for
long, meaningless years.They now talked but little, this strange
woman and the equally strange girl.Their communion was no longer of
the lips.It was the silent yearning of a dry, desolate heart,
striving to open itself to the love which the girl was sending far and
wide in the quenchless hope that it might meet just such a need.For
Carmen dwelt in the spirit, and she instinctively accepted her
splendid material environment as the gift, not of man, but of the
great divine Mind, which had led her into this new world that she
might be a channel for the expression of its love to the erring
children of mortals.She came and went quietly, and yet with as much confidence as if the
house belonged to her.At first the Beaubien smiled indulgently.And
then her smile became a laugh of eager joy as she daily greeted her
radiant visitor, whose entrance into the great, dark house was always
followed by a flood of sunshine, and whose departure marked the
setting in of night to the heart-hungry woman.In the first days of
their association the Beaubien could turn easily from the beautiful
girl to the group of cold, scheming men of the world who filled her
evenings and sat about her board.But as days melted into weeks, she
became dimly conscious of an effort attaching to the transition; and
the hour at length arrived when she fully realized that she was facing
the most momentous decision that had ever been evolved by her worldly
mode of living.But that was a matter of slow development through many
months.Hawley-Crowles trod the clouds.A week after Carmen
began the study of the organ she boldly ventured to accompany her one
day to the Beaubien citadel.She was graciously received, and departed
with the Beaubien's promise to return the call.Thereupon she set
about revising her own social list, and dropped several names which
she now felt could serve her no longer.Her week-end at Newport, just
prior to her visit to the Elwin school, had marked the close of the
gay season in the city, and New York had entered fully upon its summer
_siesta_.Even the theaters and concert halls were closed, and the
metropolis was nodding its weary head dully and sinking into
somnolence.The
summer interim would give her time to further her plans and prepare
the girl for her social _debut_ in the early winter."And Milady Ames
will be mentioned in the papers next day as assisting at the
function--the cat!"she muttered savagely, as she laid aside her
revised list of social desirables.But in preparing Carmen that summer for her subsequent entry into
polite society Mrs.Hawley-Crowles soon realized that she had
assumed a task of generous proportions.In the first place,
despite all efforts, the girl could not be brought to a proper
sense of money values.Her eyes were ever gaping in astonishment at
what Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her sister regarded as the most moderate
of expenditures, and it was only when the Beaubien herself mildly
hinted to them that ingenuousness was one of the girl's greatest
social assets, that they learned to smile indulgently at her wonder,
even while inwardly pitying her dense ignorance and lack of
sophistication.A second source of trial to her guardians was her delicate sense of
honor; and it was this that one day nearly sufficed to wreck their
standing with the fashionable Mrs.Gannette of Riverside Drive, a
pompous, bepowdered, curled and scented dame, anaemic of mind, but
tremendously aristocratic, and of scarcely inferior social dignity to
that of the envied Mrs.Gannette moved into the
neighborhood where dwelt the ambitious Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, the latter
was taken by a mutual acquaintance to call upon her, and was
immediately received into the worldly old lady's good graces.And it
so happened that, after the gay season had closed that summer, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her sister to an informal
afternoon of bridge, and especially requested that they bring their
young ward, whose beauty and wonderful story were, through the
discreet maneuvers of her guardians, beginning to be talked about.Hawley-Crowles had been inducting Carmen
into the mysteries of the game; but with indifferent success, for the
girl's thoughts invariably were elsewhere engaged.On this particular
afternoon Carmen was lost in contemplation of the gorgeous dress, the
lavish display of jewelry, and the general inanity of conversation;
and her score was pitiably low.The following morning, to her great
astonishment, she received a bill from the practical Mrs.Gannette for
ten dollars to cover her losses at the game.For a long time the
bewildered girl mused over it.Then she called the chauffeur and
despatched him to the Gannette mansion with the money necessary to
meet the gambling debt, and three dollars additional to pay for the
refreshments she had eaten, accompanying it with a polite little note
of explanation.The result was an explosion that nearly lifted the asphalt from the
Drive; and Carmen, covered with tears and confusion, was given to
understand by the irate Mrs.Hawley-Crowles that her conduct was as
reprehensible as if she had attacked the eminent Mrs.Whereupon the sorrowing Carmen packed her effects and prepared to
depart from the presence of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, to the terrified
consternation of the latter, who alternately prostrated herself before
the girl and the offended Mrs.Gannette, and at length, after many
days of perspiring effort and voluminous explanation, succeeded in
restoring peace.When the Beaubien, who had become the girl's confidante, learned the
story, she laughed till her sides ached.And then her lips set, and
her face grew terribly hard, and she muttered, "Fools!"But she smiled
again as she gathered the penitent girl in her arms, and kissed her."You will learn many things, dearie, before you are through with New
York.And," she added, her brow again clouding, "you _will_ be through
with it--some day!"That evening she repeated the story at her table, and Gannette, who
happened to be present, swore between roars of laughter that he would
use it as a club over his wife, should she ever again trap him in any
of his numerous indiscretions.Again, the girl's odd views of life and its meaning which, despite her
efforts, she could not refrain from voicing now and then, caused the
worldly Mrs.Hawley-Crowles much consternation.Carmen tried
desperately to be discreet.Even Harris advised her to listen much,
but say little; and she strove hard to obey.But she would forget and
hurl the newspapers from her with exclamations of horror over their
red-inked depictions of mortal frailty--she would flatly refuse to
discuss crime or disease--and she would comment disparagingly at too
frequent intervals on the littleness of human aims and the emptiness
of the peacock-life which she saw manifested about her."I don't
understand--I can't," she would say, when she was alone with the
Beaubien."Why, with the wonderful opportunities which you rich people
have, how can you--oh, how can you toss them aside for the frivolities
and littleness that you all seem to be striving for!It seems to me
you must be mad--_loco_!And I know you are, for you are simply
mesmerized!"Then the Beaubien would smile knowingly and take her in her arms."We
shall see," she would often say, "we shall see."Thus the summer months sped swiftly past, with Carmen ever looking and
listening, receiving, sifting, in, but not of, the new world into
which she had been cast.In a sense her existence was as narrowly
routined as ever it had been in Simiti, for her days were spent at the
great organ, with frequent rides in the automobile through the parks
and boulevards for variation; and her evenings were jealously guarded
by Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, whose policy was to keep the girl in seclusion
until the advent of her formal introduction to the world of
fashionable society, when her associates would be selected only from
the narrow circle of moneyed or titled people with whom alone she
might mingle.To permit her to form promiscuous acquaintances now
might prove fatal to the scheming woman's cherished plans, and was a
risk that could not be entertained.And Carmen, suppressing her
wonder, and striving incessantly to curb her ready tongue, accepted
her environment as the unreal expression of the human mind, and
submitted--and waited.CHAPTER 10

The chill blasts had begun to swoop down from the frozen North, and
summer had gathered her dainty robes about her and fled shivering
before them.Hawley-Crowles stood at a window and gazed with
unseeing eyes at the withered leaves tossing in the wind.Carmen's sixteenth birthday was past by some months; the gay season
was at hand; and the day was speeding toward her which she had set for
the girl's formal _debut_.Already, through informal calls and
gatherings, she had made her charming and submissive ward known to
most of her own city acquaintances and the members of her particular
set.The fresh, beautiful girl's winning personality; her frank,
ingenuous manner; her evident sincerity and her naive remarks, which
now only gave hints of her radical views, had opened every heart wide
to her, and before the advent of the social season her wonderful story
was on everybody's tongue.There remained now only the part which the
woman had planned for the Beaubien, but which, thus far, she had found
neither the courage nor the opportunity to suggest to that influential
woman.Gazing out into the deserted street, she stamped her ample foot
in sheer vexation.The Beaubien had absorbed Carmen; had been
politely affable to her and her sister; had called twice during the
summer; and had said nothing.The
hint must come from the other side; and Mrs.Hawley-Crowles could have
wept with chagrin as she reflected gloomily on her own timorous
spirit.But as she stood in dejection before the window a vague idea flitted
into her brain, and she clutched at it desperately.Carmen had spoken
of the frequent calls of a certain Monsignor Lafelle at the Beaubien
mansion, although the girl had never met him."Old Gaspard de Beaubien was a
French Catholic."Nothing--except--why, to be sure,
the girl came from a Catholic country, and therefore was a Catholic!That was worth developing a little
further."Let us see," she reflected, "Kathleen Ames is coming out
this winter, too.Candidate for her mother's
social position, of course.The Reverend Darius Borwell, D.D., L.L.D., and any other D. that will
keep him glued to his ten-thousand-dollar salary, hooked them early in
the game.Now suppose--suppose Lafelle should tell the Beaubien
that--that there's--no, that won't do!But suppose I tell him that
here's a chance for him to back a Catholic against a Protestant for
the highest social honors in New York--Carmen versus Kathleen--what
would he say?I'm just as good a Catholic as Protestant.And Catholic, Methodist, or Hard-shell
Baptist, as suited his needs.Suppose I should tip
it off to Lafelle that I'm smitten with the pious intention of
donating an altar to Holy Saints Cathedral in memory of my late,
unlamented consort--what then?Yes,
it's not a bad idea at all."And thus it was that a few days later Mrs.Hawley-Crowles timed it so
carefully that she chanced to call on the Beaubien with Carmen shortly
after Monsignor Lafelle's car had pulled up at the same door.It was
the merest accident, too, that Carmen led her puffing guardian
directly into the morning room, where sat the Beaubien and Monsignor
in earnest conversation.Hawley-Crowles would have retired at
once, stammering apologies, and reprimanding Carmen for her assumption
of liberties in another's house; but the Beaubien was grace and
cordiality itself, and she insisted on retaining her three callers and
making them mutually acquainted.Hawley-Crowles found it easy to take
the contemplated plunge.Therefore she smiled triumphantly when, a
week later, Monsignor Lafelle alighted at her own door, in response to
a summons on matters pertaining to the Church."But, Madam," replied the holy man, after carefully listening to her
announcement, "I can only refer the matter to the Bishop.I am not
connected with this diocese.But I
shall be most pleased to lay it before him, with my endorsement.""As you say, Monsignor," sweetly responded the gracious Mrs."I sought your advice because I had met you through my
dear friend, Madam Beaubien.""It has been a great pleasure to know you and to be of service to you,
Madam," said Monsignor, rising to depart."But," he added with a
tender smile, "a pleasure that would be enhanced were you to become
one of us."Hawley-Crowles knew that at last the time had come."A moment,
please, Monsignor," she said, her heart beating quickly.It concerns my ward, the young girl
whom you met at Madam Beaubien's.""And just
budding into still more beautiful womanhood."Then she threw herself precipitately into her
topic, as if she feared further delay would result in the evaporation
of her boldness."Monsignor, it is, as you say, unfortunate that I
profess no religious convictions; and yet, as I have told you, I find
that as the years pass I lean ever more strongly toward your Church.Now you will pardon me when I say that I am sure it is the avowed
intention to make America dominantly Catholic that brings you to this
country to work toward that end--is it not so?"The man's handsome face lighted up pleasantly, but he did not reply."Now, Monsignor, I am going to be terribly frank; and if you
disapprove of what I suggest, we will both forget that the matter was
ever under discussion.To begin with, I heartily endorse your
missionary efforts in this godless country of ours.Nothing but the
strong arm of the Catholic Church, it seems to me, can check our
headlong plunge into ruin.But, Monsignor, you do not always work
where your labors are most needed.You may control political--"

"My dear lady," interrupted the man, holding up a hand and shaking his
head in gentle demurral, "the Catholic Church is not in politics.""But it is in society--or should be!""And
if the Catholic Church is to be supreme in America it must work from
the top down, as well as from the lower levels upward.At present our
wealthiest, most influential social set is absolutely domineered by a
Protestant--and under the influence of a Presbyterian minister at
that!Monsignor Lafelle's eyes twinkled, as he listened politely.But he
only stroked the white hair that crowned his shapely head, and
waited."Monsignor," continued the now thoroughly heated Mrs.Hawley-Crowles,
"why do not the women of your Church constitute our society leaders?Why do you not recognize the desirability of forcing your people into
every avenue of human activity?And would you resent a suggestion from
me as to how in one instance this might be accomplished?""Certainly not, Madam," replied Monsignor, with an expression of
wonder on his face."You are laughing at me, I do believe!"she exclaimed, catching the
glint in his gray eyes."Pardon me, dear lady, I really am deeply interested."Well, at any rate I have your promise to forget this conversation if
you do not approve of it," she said quizzically.He nodded his head to inspire her confidence; and she continued:

"Very well, now to the point.My ward, the little Inca princess, is
coming out shortly.I want her to have the _entree_ into the very best
society, into the most fashionable and exclusive set, as befitting her
rank."She stopped and awaited the effect of her words.Monsignor studied her for a moment, and then broke into a genial
laugh."There is nothing reprehensible in your wish, Madam," he said."Our social system, however imperfect, nevertheless exists,
and--dominant Catholic influence might improve it."Why, I really see nothing that I can do," he replied slowly.Hawley-Crowles was becoming exasperated with his apparent
dullness."You can do much," she retorted in a tone tinctured with
impatience."Since I have made you my Father Confessor to-day, I am
going to tell you that I intend to start a social war that will rip
this city wide open.It is going to be war in which Catholic is pitted
against Protestant.For a moment her blunt question startled him, and he stared at her
uncomprehendingly; but he quickly recovered his poise and replied
calmly, "Neither, Madam; it remains quite neutral.""Pardon me if I say it; not at all."she murmured, her eagerness subsiding."Then I've made an awful
mistake!""No," he amended gently, "you have made a good friend.And, as such, I
again urge you first to respect the leaning which you mentioned a
moment ago and become actively affiliated with our Church here in New
York."Certainly I will consider it," she responded, brightening with hope."And I will go so far as to say that I have long had it in mind.""Then, Madam, when that is accomplished, we may discuss the less
important matter of your ward's entrance into society--is it not so?"Hawley-Crowles rose, completely discomfited."But the girl,
Monsignor, is already a Catholic--comes from a Catholic country.It is
she whom I am pitting against the Protestant.""You are cruel," she retorted, affecting an air of injured innocence
as she stood before him with downcast eyes."But--if you--"

"Madam," said Monsignor, "plainly, what is it that you wish me to
do?"The sudden propounding of the question drew an equally sudden but less
thoughtful response."Tell the Beau--Madam Beaubien that you wish my ward to be received
into the best society, and for the reasons I have given you."And is my influence with Madam Beaubien, and hers with the members of
fashionable society, sufficient to effect that?"he asked, an odd look
coming into his eyes."She has but to say the word to J. Wilton Ames, and his wife will
receive us both," said the woman, carried away by her eagerness."And
that means strong Catholic influence in New York's most aristocratic
set!""Monsignor," continued the woman eagerly, "will your Church receive an
altar from me in memory of my late husband?"Then, slowly, and in a low, earnest tone, "It
would receive such a gift from one of the faith.When may we expect
you to become a communicant?"The woman paled, and her heart suddenly chilled.She had wondered how
far she might go with this clever churchman, and now she knew that she
had gone too far.But to retract--to have him relate this conversation
and her retraction to the Beaubien--were fatal!She had set her
trap--and walked into it.Then,
raising her eyes and meeting his searching glance, she murmured
feebly, "Whenever you say, Monsignor."When the man had departed, which he did immediately, the plotting
woman threw herself upon the davenport and wept with rage."Belle,"
she wailed, as her wondering sister entered the room, "I'm going to
join the Catholic Church!But I'd go through Sheol to beat that Ames
outfit!"CHAPTER 11


MONSIGNOR LAFELLE made another afternoon call on the Beaubien a few
days later.That lady, fresh from her bath, scented, powdered, and
charming in a loose, flowing Mandarin robe, received him graciously."But I can give you only a moment, Monsignor," she said, waving him to
a chair, while she stooped and tenderly took up the two spaniels."I
have a dinner to-night, and so shall not listen unless you have
something fresh and really worth while to offer.""My dear Madam," said he, bowing low before he sank into the great
leather armchair, "you are charming, and the Church is justly proud of
you.""Tut, tut, my friend," she returned, knitting her brows."That may be
fresh, I admit, but not worth listening to.And if you persist in that
vein I shall be obliged to have William set you into the street.""I can not apologize for voicing the truth, dear Madam," he replied,
as his eyes roved admiringly over her comely figure."The Church has
never ceased to claim you, however far you may have wandered from her.I am leaving for Canada shortly on a mission of
some importance.May I not take with me the consoling assurance that
you have at last heard and yielded to the call of the tender Mother,
who has never ceased to yearn for her beautiful, wayward daughter?""There," she said gently, "I thought
that was it.No, Monsignor, no," shaking her head."When only a wild,
thoughtless girl I became a Catholic in order that I might marry
Gaspard de Beaubien.The priest urged; and I--<DW30>!But
the past eighteen years have confirmed me in some views; and one is
that I shall gain nothing, either here or hereafter, by renewing my
allegiance to the Church of Rome."Monsignor sighed, and stroked his abundant white hair."I learned this morning," he said musingly, "that my
recent labors with the Dowager Duchess of Altern in England have not
been vain.She has become a communicant of Holy Church.""The Duchess of Altern--sister of Mrs.Why, she was a high Anglican--"

"Only a degree below the true Church, Madam.Her action is but
anticipatory of a sweeping return of the entire Anglican Church to the
true fold.And I learn further," he went on, "that the Duchess will
spend the winter in New York with her sister.Which means, of course,
an unusually gay season here, does it not?"The Beaubien quickly recovered from her astonishment."Well,
Monsignor," she laughed, "for once you really are interesting.Ames herself will be the next
convert?But one of your most intimate friends will
become a communicant of Holy Saints next Sunday."The Beaubien set the spaniels down
on the floor."Now, my dear Monsignor, you are positively refreshing."Am I not right when I insist that you have
wandered far, dear Madam?It is not 'he,' but'she,' your dear friend,
Mrs.The Beaubien's mouth opened wide and she sat suddenly upright and
gazed blankly at her raconteur.The man went on, apparently oblivious
of the effect his information had produced."Her beautiful ward, who
is to make her bow to society this winter, is one of us by birth.""Then you have been at work on Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her ward, have
you?"said the Beaubien severely, and there was a threatening note in
her voice."Why," returned Monsignor easily, "the lady sent for me to express her
desire to become affiliated with the Church.And I
have had no conversation with the girl, I assure you."Then:

"Will you tell me why, Monsignor, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles takes this
unusual step?"Is it unusual, Madam, for a woman who has seen much of the
world to turn from it to the solace and promise of the Church?"Hawley-Crowles it
is, decidedly."Monsignor, I do not.And by this time you
do, too.She is the last woman in the world to turn from it.""But the question you have just propounded reflects seriously upon
both the Church and me--"

"Bah!"interjected the Beaubien, her eyes flashing."Wait," she
commanded imperiously, as he rose."I have a few things to say to you,
since this is to be your last call.""Madam, not the last, I hope.For I shall not cease to plead the cause
of the Church to you--"

"Surely, Monsignor, that is your business.You are welcome in my
house at any time, and particularly when you have such delightful
scraps of gossip as these which you have brought to-day.But, a word
before you go, lest you become indiscreet on your return.Hawley-Crowles to any extent you wish, but let her ward
alone--_absolutely_!The cold, even tone in which the woman said this left no doubt in the
man's mind of her meaning.She was not trifling with him now, he knew.In her low-voiced words he found no trace of banter, of sophistry, nor
of aught that he might in any wise misinterpret."Now, Monsignor, I have some influence in New York, as you may
possibly know.Will you admit that I can do much for or against you?Drop your mask, therefore, and tell me frankly just what has induced
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to unite with your Church."The man knew he was pitting his own against a master mind.He
hesitated and weighed well his words before replying."Madam," said he
at length, with a note of reproach, "you misjudge the lady, the
Church, and me, its humble servant.Hawley-Crowles, I speak truly when I say that doubtless she
has been greatly influenced by love for her late husband."The Beaubien half rose from her chair."Jim Crowles--that raw,
Irish boob, who was holding down a job on the police force until Ames
found he could make a convenient tool of him!The man who was
Gannette's cat's-paw in the Fall River franchise steal!Now,
Monsignor, would you have me believe you devoid of all sense?""But," ejaculated the man, now becoming exasperated, and for the
moment so losing his self-control as to make wretched use of his
facts, "she is erecting an altar in Holy Saints as a memorial to
him!"Monsignor Lafelle again made as if to rise.He felt that he was guilty
of a miserable _faux pas_."Madam, I regret that I must be leaving.But the hour--"

"Stay, Monsignor!"The Beaubien roused up and laid a detaining hand
upon his arm."Our versatile friend, what other projects has she in
hand?"Why, really, I can not say--beyond the fact that the girl is to be
introduced to society this winter."Going to make a try for the Ames set?""That, I believe, Madam, would be useless without your aid."Hawley-Crowles say so, Monsignor?"demanded the woman,
leaning forward eagerly."Why, I believe I am not abusing her confidence when I say that she
intimated as much," he said, watching her closely and sparring now
with better judgment.Ames as New York's
fashionable society leader--"

"There is no such position as leader in New York society, Monsignor,"
interrupted the Beaubien coldly."There are sets and cliques, and
Mrs.Ames happens to be prominent in the one which at present
foolishly imagines it constitutes the upper stratum.Hawley-Crowles, with nothing but a tarnished name and a large bank
account to recommend her, now wishes to break into that clique and
attain social leadership, does she?Then the woman's eyes narrowed and grew hard.Leaning closer to
the churchman, she rested the tip of her finger on his knee."So, Monsignor," she said, with cold precision, "this is Mrs.Hawley-Crowles's method of renouncing the world, is it?And she would use both you and me, eh?And you are her ambassador
at the court of the Beaubien?Very well, then, she shall use us.But you and I will first make this compact, my dear Monsignor:
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles shall be taken into the so-called 'Ames set,'
and you shall cease importuning me to return to your Church, and
what is more, shall promise to have no conversation on church
matters with her ward, the young girl.If you do not agree to
this, Monsignor, I shall set in motion forces that will make your
return to New York quite undesirable."When she concluded, she
looked long and steadily into his eyes.Monsignor got slowly to his feet.he exclaimed in a hoarse
whisper, "my astonishment--"

"There," she said calmly, as she rose and took his hand, "please omit
the dramatics, Monsignor.And now you must go, for to-night I
entertain, and I have already given you more time than I intended.But, Monsignor, do you in future work with or against me?"Why, Madam," he replied quickly, "we could never be the latter!""And you always respect the wishes of a friend, especially if she is a
lady, do you not?""Always, Madam," he returned after a moment's hesitation, as he bowed
low over her hand.And, Monsignor," she added, when he reached the door,
"I shall be pleased to attend the dedication of the Hawley-Crowles
altar."When Monsignor's car glided away from her door the Beaubien's face
grew dark, and her eyes drew to narrow slits."So," she reflected, as
she entered the elevator to mount to her dressing room, "that is her
game, is it?The poor, fat simpleton has no interest in either the
girl or myself, other than to use us as stepping-stones.She forgets
that a stone sometimes turns under the foot.She entered her room and rang for her maid.Turning to the pier glass,
she threw on the electric light and scrutinized her features narrowly."It's going," she murmured, "fast!Oh, what a farce life is--what a howling, mocking farce!No--that little girl--if it is possible
for me to love, I love her.""I wonder what it is she does to me.I'm
hypnotized, I guess.Anyhow, I'm different when I'm with her.And to
think that Hawley-Crowles would sacrifice the child--humph!But, if
the girl is made of the right stuff--and I know she is--she will stand
up under it and be stronger for the experience.She has got something
that will make her stand!I once asked her what she had that I didn't,
and now I know--it is her religion, the religion that Borwell and
Lafelle and the whole kit of preachers and priests would corrupt if
they had half a chance!Very well, we'll see what it does under the
test.If it saves her, then I want it myself.But, as for that little
pin-headed Hawley-Crowles, she's already signed her own death-warrant.She shall get into the Ames set, yes.And I will use her, oh,
beautifully!to pay off certain old scores against Madam Ames--and
then I'll crush her like a dried leaf, the fat fool!"The Beaubien's position was, to say the least, peculiar, and one which
required infinite tact on her part to protect.It was for that reason
that the decorum which prevailed at her dinners was so rigidly
observed, and that, whatever the moral status of the man who sat at
her board, his conduct was required to be above reproach, on penalty
of immediate ejection from the circle of financial pirates, captains
of commercial jugglery, and political intriguers who made these feasts
opportunities for outlining their predatory campaigns against that
most anomalous of creatures, the common citizen.It was about this table, at whose head always sat the richly gowned
Beaubien, that the inner circle of financial kings had gathered almost
nightly for years to rig the market, determine the price of wheat or
cotton, and develop mendacious schemes of stock-jobbery whose golden
harvests they could calculate almost to a dollar before launching.As
the wealth of this clique of financial manipulators swelled beyond all
bounds, so increased their power, until at last it could be justly
said that, when Ames began to dominate the Stock Exchange, the
Beaubien practically controlled Wall Street--and, therefore, in a
sense, Washington itself.But always with a tenure of control
dubiously dependent upon the caprices of the men who continued to pay
homage to her personal charm and keen, powerful intellect.At the time of which we speak her power was at its zenith, and she
could with equal impunity decapitate the wealthiest, most aristocratic
society dame, or force the door of the most exclusive set for any
protegee who might have been kept long years knocking in vain, or
whose family name, perchance, headed a list of indictments for gross
peculations.At these unicameral meetings, held in the great, dark,
mahogany-wainscoted dining room of the Beaubien mansion, where a
single lamp of priceless workmanship threw a flood of light upon the
sumptuous table beneath and left the rest of the closely guarded room
shrouded in Stygian darkness, plans were laid and decrees adopted
which seated judges, silenced clergymen, elected senators, and
influenced presidents.There a muck-raking, hostile press was muffled.There business opposition was crushed and competition throttled.There
tax rates were determined and tariff schedules formulated.There
public opinion was disrupted, character assassinated, and the
death-warrant of every threatening reformer drawn and signed.In a
word, there Mammon, in the _role_ of business, organized and
unorganized, legitimate and piratical, sat enthroned, with wires
leading into every mart of the world, and into every avenue of human
endeavor, be it social, political, commercial, or religious.These
wires were gathered together into the hands of one man, the directing
genius of the group, J. Wilton Ames.Over him lay the shadow of the
Beaubien.An hour after the departure of Monsignor Lafelle the Beaubien, like a
radiant sun, descended to the library to greet her assembled guests.Some moments later the heavy doors of the great dining room swung
noiselessly open, and the lady proceeded unescorted to her position at
the head of the table.At her signal the half dozen men sat down, and
the butler immediately entered, followed by two serving men with the
cocktails and the first course.The chair at the far end of the table,
opposite the Beaubien, remained unoccupied."Ames is late to-night," observed the girthy Gannette, glancing toward
the vacant seat, and clumsily attempting to tuck his napkin into his
collar.The Beaubien looked sharply at him."Were you at the club this
afternoon, Mr.Gannette straightened up and became rigid.Pulling the napkin down
hastily, he replied in a thick voice, "Just a little game of
bridge--some old friends--back from Europe--"

The Beaubien turned to the butler.Gannette is not
drinking wine this evening."The butler bowed and removed the glasses
from that gentleman's place."Now, Lucile--" he began peevishly.The Beaubien held up a hand.Gannette glowered and sank down in his
chair like a swollen toad."May be Ames is trying to break into the C. and R. directors'
meeting," suggested Weston, himself a director in a dozen companies,
and a bank president besides."They tell me," said Fitch, "that for once Ames has been outwitted,
and that by a little bucket-shop broker named Ketchim."queried Kane, Board of Trade plunger, and the most
mettlesome speculator of the group."Why," explained Weston, "some months ago Ames tried to reach Ed.Stolz through Ketchim, the old man's nephew, and get control of C. and
R. But friend nephew dropped the portcullis just as Ames was dashing
across the drawbridge, and J. Wilton found himself outside, looking
through the bars.First time I've ever known that to happen.Now the
boys have got hold of it on 'Change, and Ames has been getting it from
every quarter.""Long time leaking out, seems to me," remarked Kane."But what's Ames
going to do about it?""He seems to have dropped the
matter.""I think you will find yourself mistaken," put in the Beaubien
evenly.queried Fitch, as all eyes turned upon the woman.Ames always gets what he goes
after, and he will secure control of C. and R.vigorously asserted Murdock, who had been an
interested listener."I have one thousand dollars that says he will," said the Beaubien,
calmly regarding the speaker.Murdock seemed taken back for the moment; but lost no time recovering
his poise.Drawing out his own book he wrote a check in the Beaubien's
name for the amount and sent it down the table to her.Fitch will hold the stakes," said the woman, handing him the two
slips of paper."And we will set a time limit of eighteen months.""By the way," remarked Peele, the only one of the group who had taken
no part in the preceding conversation, "I see by the evening paper
that there's been another accident in the Avon mills.Fellow named
Marcus caught in a machine and crushed all out of shape.That's the
third one down there this month.They'll force Ames to equip his mills
with safety devices if this keeps up.""Not while the yellow metal has any influence upon the Legislature,"
returned the Beaubien with a knowing smile."But," she added more
seriously, "that is not where the danger lies.The real source of
apprehension is in the possibility of a strike.And if war breaks out
among those Hungarians down there it will cost him more than to equip
all his mills now with safety devices."Gannette, who had been sulking in his chair, roused up."Speaking
of war," he growled, "has Ames, or any of you fellows, got a
finger in the muddle in South America?I've got interests down
there--concessions and the like--and by--!"He wandered off into
incoherent mutterings.The Beaubien gave a sharp command to the butler.cried Gannette, his apoplectic face becoming
more deeply purple, and his blear eyes leering angrily upon the calm
woman."I ain't a-goin' to stand this!I'm as sober
as any one here, an'--" William took the heavy man gently by the arm
and persuaded him to his feet.The other guests suppressed their
smiles and remained discreetly quiet."Have Henri take him to his club, William," said the Beaubien, rising.We will expect you Wednesday evening, and
we trust that we will not have to accept your excuses again."Gannette was led soddenly out.The Beaubien quietly resumed her seat.It was the second time the man had been dismissed from her table, and
the guests marveled that it did not mean the final loss of her favor.But she remained inscrutable; and the conversation quickly drifted
into new channels.A few moments later William returned and made a
quiet announcement:

"Mr.A huge presence emerged from the darkness into the light.The Beaubien
immediately rose and advanced to greet the newcomer.she
whispered, taking his hand.The man smiled down into her upturned, anxious face.His only reply
was a reassuring pressure of her hand.But she comprehended, and her
face brightened."Gentlemen," remarked Ames, taking the vacant chair, "the President's
message is out.I have been going over it with Hood--which accounts
for my tardiness," he added, nodding pleasantly to the Beaubien."Quoting from our chief executive's long list of innocent platitudes,
I may say that 'private monopoly is criminally unjust, wholly
indefensible, and not to be tolerated in a Republic founded upon the
premise of equal rights to all mankind.'"concurred Weston, holding up his glass and gazing
admiringly at the rich color of the wine."Quite my sentiments, too," murmured Fitch,
rolling his eyes upward and attempting with poor success to assume a
beatific expression."Furthermore," continued Ames, with mock gravity, "the interlocking of
corporation directorates must be prohibited by law; power must be
conferred upon the Interstate Commerce Commission to superintend the
financial management of railroads; holding-companies must cease to
exist; and corrective policies must be shaped, whereby so-called
'trusts' will be regulated and rendered innocuous."We are," said they all, in one voice."Carried," concluded Ames in a solemn tone.Then a burst of laughter
rose from the table; and even the inscrutable William smiled behind
his hand."But, seriously," said Weston, when the laughter had ceased, "I
believe we've got a President now who's going to do something, don't
you?""As long as the human mind
remains as it is there is nothing to fear, though Congress legislate
itself blue in the face.Reform is not to be made like a garment and
forced upon the people from the outside.Restrictive measures have not as yet, in all the history of
civilization, reformed a single criminal.""That we are puncture-proof," replied Ames with a light laugh."But what about your indictment in that cotton deal?Is Hood going to
find you law-proof there?""The case is settled," said Ames easily."I went into court this
morning and plead guilty to the indictment for conspiring to corner
the cotton market two years ago.I admitted that I violated the
Sherman law.The judge promptly fined me three thousand dollars, for
which I immediately wrote a check, leaving me still the winner by some
two million seven hundred thousand dollars on the deal, to say nothing
of compound interest on the three thousand for the past two years.You
see the beneficent effect of legislation, do you not?""By George, Ames, you certainly were stingy not to let us in on that!""Cotton belongs to me, gentlemen," replied Ames simply."Well," remarked Fitch, glancing about the table, "suppose we get down
to the business of the evening--if agreeable to our hostess," bowing
in the direction of the Beaubien."Has any one
anything new to offer?""There is a little
matter," he began, "that I have been revolving for some days.It occurred to
me some time ago that a franchise for a trolley line on that road
could be secured and ultimately sold for a round figure to the wealthy
residents whose estates lie along it, and who would give a million
dollars rather than have a line built there.After some preliminary
examination I got Hood to draft a bill providing for the building of
the road, and submitted it to Jacobson, Commissioner of Highways.He
reported that it would be the means of destroying the post road.I
convinced him, on the other hand, that it would be the means of lining
his purse with fifty thousand dollars.So he very naturally gave it
his endorsement.I then got in consultation with Senator Gossitch, and
had him arrange a meeting with the Governor, in Albany.I think," he
concluded, "that about five hundred thousand dollars will grease the
wheels all 'round.I've got the Governor on the hip in that Southern
Mexican deal, and he is at present eating out of my hand.I'll lay
this project on the table now, and you can take it up if you so
desire.""The scheme seems all right," commented Weston, after a short
meditation."Well, a net profit of half a million to split up among us would at
least provide for a yachting party next summer," remarked Ames
sententiously."And no work connected with it--in fact, the work has
been done.I shall want an additional five per cent for handling it."An animated discussion followed; and then Fitch offered a motion that
the group definitely take up the project.The Beaubien put the vote,
and it was carried without dissent."What about that potato scheme you were figuring on, Ames?"asked
Fitch at this juncture."I didn't get much encouragement from my
friends," he replied."I don't believe it," put in Weston emphatically."I have one million dollars that says it could," returned Ames calmly.Weston threw up his hands in token of surrender.he
exclaimed, scurrying for cover."Well," he said, "suppose we look into the scheme and
see if we don't want to handle it.It simply calls for a little
thought and work.He stopped and glanced at the Beaubien for approval.She nodded, and
he went on:

"I have lately been investigating the subject of various food supplies
other than wheat and corn as possible bases for speculation, and my
attention has been drawn strongly to a very humble one, potatoes."But Ames continued
unperturbed:

"I find that in some sections of the West potatoes are so plentiful at
times that they bring but twenty cents a bushel.My investigations
have covered a period of several months, and now I have in my
possession a large map of the United States with the potato sections,
prices, freight rates and all other necessary data indicated.My idea is to send agents into all these
sections next summer before the potatoes are turned up, and contract
for the entire crop at twenty-five cents a bushel.The agents will pay
the farmers cash, and agree to assume all expenses of digging,
packing, shipping, and so forth, allowing the farmer to take what he
needs for his own consumption.Needless to say, the potatoes will not
be removed from the fields, but will be allowed to rot in the ground.Those that do reach the market will sell for a dollar and a half in
New York and Chicago.""In other words," added Fitch, "you are simply figuring to corner the
market for the humble tuber, eh?""But--you say you have all the necessary data now?""All, even to the selection of a few of my agents.I can control
freight rates for what we may wish to ship.The rest of the crop will
be left to rot.And the
consumers will pay our price for what they must have.""And how much do you figure we shall
need to round the corner?""A million, cash in hand," replied Ames."Is this anything that the women can mix into?""You know they forced us to dump tons of our cold-storage stuff onto
the market two years ago.""That was when I controlled wheat," said Ames, "and was all tied up.It will be done so quietly
and thoroughly that it will all be over and the profits pocketed
before the women wake up to what we're doing.In this case there will
be nothing to store.And potatoes exposed in the field rot quickly,
you know."The rest of the group seemed to study the idea for some moments.Then
the practical Murdock inquired of Ames if he would agree to handle the
project, provided they took it up."Yes," assented Ames, "on a five per cent basis.And I am ready to put
agents in the field to-morrow.""Then, Madam Beaubien," said Fitch, "I move that we adopt the plan as
set forth by Mr.Ames, and commission him to handle it, calling upon
us equally for whatever funds he may need."A further brief discussion ensued; and then the resolution was
unanimously adopted."Say, Ames," queried Weston, with a glint of mischief in his eyes,
"will any of these potatoes be shipped over the C. and R.?"A laugh
went up around the table, in which Ames himself joined."Yes," he
said, "potatoes and cotton will both go over that road next summer,
and I shall fix the rebates."suggested Fitch, with a wink at
Murdock.Ames's mouth set grimly, and the smile left his face."Ketchim is
going to Sing Sing for that little deal," he returned in a low, cold
tone, so cold that even the Beaubien could not repress a little
shudder."I had him on Molino, but he trumped up a new company which
absorbed Molino and satisfied everybody, so I am blocked for the
present.But, mark me, I shall strip him of every dollar, and then put
him behind the bars before I've finished!"And no one sought to refute the man, for they knew he spoke truth.At midnight, while the cathedral chimes in the great hall clock were
sending their trembling message through the dark house, the Beaubien
rose, and the dinner was concluded.A few moments later the guests
were spinning in their cars to their various homes or clubs--all but
Ames.As he was preparing to leave, the Beaubien laid a hand on his
arm."Wait a moment, Wilton," she said."I have something important to
discuss with you."She led him into the morning room, where a fire was
blazing cheerily in the grate, and drew up a chair before it for him,
then nestled on the floor at his feet."I sent Gannette home this evening," she began, by way of introduction.I would drop him entirely, only you said--"

"We need him," interrupted Ames."I'll soil my hands by doing it; but it is for you.Now tell me," she
went on eagerly, "what about Colombia?Have you any further news from
Wenceslas?"The Church is
with the Government, and they will win--although your money may be
tied up for a few years.Still, you can't lose in the end."The woman sat for some moments gazing into the fire.Then:

"Lafelle was here again to-day.""Hold him, too," said Ames quickly."Looks as if I had made you a sort
of holding company, doesn't it?""But we
shall have good use for these fellows.""He gave me some very interesting news," she said; and then went on to
relate the conversation in detail.Ames laughed loudly as he
listened."And now, Wilton," said the Beaubien, a determined look
coming into her face, "you have always said that you never forgave me
for making you let Jim Crowles off, when you had him by the throat.Well, I'm going to give you a chance to get more than even.Jim's fat
widow is after your wife's scalp.I intend that she shall lose her own
in the chase.I've got my plans all laid, and I want your wife to meet
the lovely Mrs.Hawley-Crowles at the Fitch's next Thursday afternoon.It will be just a formal call--mutual introductions--and, later, an
invitation from Mrs.Meantime, I want you
to get Mrs.Hawley-Crowles involved in a financial way, and shear her
of every penny!"My dear," said he, taking her hand, "you are charming this
evening.she deprecated, although the smile she gave him
attested her pleasure in the compliment."Well," she continued
briskly, "if I'm so beautiful, you can't help loving me; and if you
love me, you will do what I ask."Really,
I've long since forgotten him.Do you realize that that was more than
ten years ago?""Please don't mention years, dear," she murmured, shuddering a little."Tell me, what can we do to teach this fat hussy a lesson?""Well," he suggested, laughing, "we might get Ketchim after her, to
sell her a wad of his worthless stocks; then when he goes down, as he
is going one of these days, we will hope that it will leave her on the
rocks of financial ruin, eh?""Why, among other innocent novelties, a scheme bearing the sonorous
title of Simiti Development Company, I am told by my brokers."Why--I've heard Carmen mention that name.I wonder--"

"Well, and who is Carmen?""My little friend--the one and only honest person I've ever dealt
with, excepting, of course, present company."And now where does this Carmen enter the
game?""Why, she's--surely you know about her!""Well, she is a little Colombian--"

"Colombian!"Came up with the engineers who
went down there for Ketchim to examine the Molino properties.She
lived all her life in a town called Simiti until she came up here."Ames leaned over and looked steadily into the fire."Never heard of
the place," he murmured dreamily."Well," said the Beaubien eagerly, "she's a--a wonderful child!I'm
different when I'm with her."He roused from his meditations and smiled down at the woman."Then I'd
advise you not to be with her much, for I prefer you as you are."Then the woman looked up at her
companion.The man started; then drew himself up and gave a little nervous laugh."Of you," he replied evasively, "always."She reached up and slapped his cheek tenderly."You were dreaming of
your awful business deals," she said."What have you in hand
now?--besides the revolution in Colombia, your mines, your mills, your
banks, your railroads and trolley lines, your wheat and potato
corners, your land concessions and cattle schemes, and--well, that's a
start, at least," she finished, pausing for breath.I'm buying every bale I can find, in Europe, Asia, and
the States.""But, Will, you've been caught in cotton before, you know.And I don't
believe you can get away with it again.Unless--"

"That's it--unless," he interrupted."And that's just the part I have
taken care of.The cotton schedule will go
through as I have it outlined.They
don't dare refuse to pass the measure.In a few
months the tariff on cotton products will be up.The new tariff-wall
sends the price of raw stuff soaring.I
was beaten on the last deal simply because of faulty weather
prognostications.I'll let you in, if you wish.But these other fellows have got
to stay out.""I haven't a penny to invest, Will," she replied mournfully."You got
me so terribly involved in this Colombian revolution.""Oh, well," he returned easily, "I'll lend you what you need, any
amount.And you can give me your advice and suggestions from time to
time.As for your Colombian investments, haven't I guaranteed them,
practically?""Not in writing," she said, looking up at him with a twinkle in her
eyes."No, certainly not," she returned, giving him a glance of admiration.Hawley-Crowles is going to be received into your
wife's set, and you are going to give her a good financial whipping?"Hawley-Crowles
shall go to the poor-house, if you say the word.But now, my dear,
have William order my car.Hawley-Crowles at Fitch's?"Yes, dear," murmured the Beaubien, reaching up and kissing him; "next
Thursday at three.Call me on the 'phone to-morrow."CHAPTER 12


The Ames building, a block from the Stock Exchange, was originally
only five stories in height.But as the Ames interests grew, floor
after floor was added, until, on the day that Mrs.Hawley-Crowles
pointed it out to Carmen from the window of her limousine, it had
reached, tower and all, a height of twenty-five stories, and was
increasing at an average rate of two additional a year.It was not its
size that aroused interest, overtopped as it was by many others, but
its uniqueness; for, though a hive of humming industry, it did not
house a single business that was not either owned outright or
controlled by J. Wilton Ames, from the lowly cigar stands in the
marble corridors to the great banking house of Ames and Company on the
second floor.The haberdashers, the shoe-shining booths, the soda
fountains, and the great commercial enterprises that dwelt about them,
each and all acknowledged fealty and paid homage to the man who
brooded over them in his magnificent offices on the twenty-fifth floor
in the tower above.It was not by any consensus of opinion among the financiers of New
York that Ames had assumed leadership, but by sheer force of what
was doubtless the most dominant character developed in recent
years by those peculiar forces which have produced the American
multimillionaire."And," he once added, when, despite his anger, he could
not but admire Ames's tactical blocking of his piratical move, which
the former's keen foresight had perceived threatened danger at
Washington, "it is not by any tacit agreement that we accept him,
but because he knows ten tricks to our one, that's all."To look at the man, now in his forty-fifth year, meant, generally, an
expression of admiration for his unusual physique, and a wholly
erroneous appraisal of his character.His build was that of a
gladiator.He stood six-feet-four in height, with Herculean shoulders
and arms, and a pair of legs that suggested nothing so much as the
great pillars which supported the facade of the Ames building.Those
arms and legs, and those great back-muscles, had sent his college
shell to victory every year that he had sat in the boat.They had won
every game on the gridiron in which he had participated as the
greatest "center" the college ever developed.For baseball he was a
bit too massive, much to his own disappointment, but the honors he
failed to secure there he won in the field events, and in the
surreptitiously staged boxing and wrestling bouts when, hidden away in
the cellar of some secret society hall, he would crush his opponents
with an ease and a peculiar glint of satisfaction in his gray eyes
that was grimly prophetic of days to come.His mental attitude toward
contests for superiority of whatever nature did not differ essentially
from that of the Roman gladiators: he entered them to win.If he fell,
well and good; he expected "thumbs down."If he won, his opponent need
look for no exhibition of generosity on his part.When his man lay
prone before him, he stooped and cut his throat.And he would have
loathed the one who forbore to do likewise with himself.In scholarship he might have won a place, had not the physical side of
his nature been so predominant, and his remarkable muscular strength
so great a prize to the various athletic coaches and directors.Ames
was first an animal; there was no stimulus as yet sufficiently strong
to arouse his latent spirituality.And yet his intellect was keen; and
to those studies to which he was by nature or inheritance especially
attracted, economics, banking, and all branches of finance, he brought
a power of concentration that was as stupendous as his physical
strength.His mental make-up was peculiar, in that it was the epitome
of energy--manifested at first only in brute force--and in that it was
wholly deficient in the sense of fear.Because of this his daring was
phenomenal.Immediately upon leaving college Ames became associated with his
father in the already great banking house of Ames and Company.But the
animality of his nature soon found the confinement irksome; his
father's greater conservatism hampered his now rapidly expanding
spirit of commercialism; and after a few years in the banking house he
withdrew and set up for himself.The father, while lacking the boy's
fearlessness, had long since recognized dominant qualities in him
which he himself did not possess, and he therefore confidently
acquiesced in his son's desire, and, in addition, gave him _carte
blanche_ in the matter of funds for his speculative enterprises.Four years later J. Wilton Ames, rich in his own name, already
becoming recognized as a power in the world of finance, with
diversified enterprises which reached into almost every country of the
globe, hastened home from a foreign land in response to a message
announcing the sudden death of his father.The devolving of his
parent's vast fortune upon himself--he was the sole heir--then
necessitated his permanent location in New York.And so, reluctantly
giving up his travels, he gathered his agents and lieutenants about
him, concentrating his interests as much as possible in the Ames
building, and settled down to the enjoyment of expanding his huge
fortune.A few months later he married, and the union amalgamated the
proud old Essex stock of Ames, whose forbears fought under the
Conqueror and were written in the Doomsday Book, to the wealthy and
aristocratic Van Heyse branch of old Amsterdam.To this union were
born a son and a daughter, twins.The interval between his graduation from college and the death of his
father was all but unknown to the cronies of his subsequent years in
New York.Though he had spent much of it in the metropolis, he had
been self-centered and absorbed, even lonely, while laying his plans
and developing the schemes which resulted in financial preeminence.With unlimited money at his disposal, he was unhampered in the choice
of his business clientele, and he formed it from every quarter of the
globe.Much of his time had been spent abroad, and he had become as
well known on the Paris bourse and the exchanges of Europe as in his
native land.Confident and successful from the outset; without any
trace of pride or touch of hauteur in his nature; as wholly lacking in
ethical development and in generosity as he was in fear; gradually
becoming more sociable and companionable, although still reticent of
certain periods of his past; his cunning and brutality increasing with
years; and his business sagacity and keen strategy becoming the talk
of the Street; with no need to raise his eyes beyond the low plane of
his material endeavors; he pursued his business partly for the
pleasure the game afforded him, partly for the power which his
accumulations bestowed upon him, and mostly because it served as an
adequate outlet for his tremendous, almost superhuman, driving energy.If he betrayed and debauched ideals, it was because he was utterly
incapable of rising to them, nor felt the stimulus to make the
attempt.If he achieved no noble purpose, it was because when he
glanced at the mass of humanity about him he looked through the lenses
of self.His glance fell always first upon J. Wilton Ames--and he
never looked beyond.The world had been created for him; the cosmos
but expressed his Ego.On the morning after his conversation with the Beaubien regarding the
social aspirations of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, the financier sat at his
rich mahogany desk on the top floor of the Ames building in earnest
discussion with his lawyer, Alonzo Hood.The top floor of the tower
was divided into eight rooms.Two of these constituted Ames's inner
_sanctum_; one was Hood's private office; and the rest were devoted
to clerks and stenographers.A telegrapher occupied an alcove
adjoining Hood's room, and handled confidential messages over
private wires to the principal cities in the country.A private
telephone connected Ames's desk with the Beaubien mansion.Private
lines ran to the Stock Exchange and to various other points
throughout the city.The telegraph and telephone companies gave his
messages preference over all others.At a word he would be placed in
almost instant communication with New Orleans, San Francisco, London,
Berlin, or Cairo.Private lines and speaking tubes ran to every room
or floor of the building where a company, firm, or individual was
doing business.At the office of the Telegraph Service up-town he
maintained messengers who carried none but his own despatches.In
the railroad yards his private car stood always in readiness; and in
the harbor his yacht was kept constantly under steam.A motor car
stood ever in waiting in the street below, close to the shaft of a
private automatic elevator, which ran through the building for his
use alone.This elevator also penetrated the restaurant in the
basement of the building, where a private room and a special waiter
were always at the man's disposal.A private room and special
attendant were maintained in the Turkish baths adjoining, and he
had his own personal suite and valet at his favorite club up-town.This morning he was at his desk, as usual, at eight o'clock.Before
him lay the various daily reports from his mines, his mills, his
railroads, and his bank.These disposed of, there followed a quick
survey of the day's appointments, arranged for him by his chief
secretary.As the latter entered, Ames was
absorbed in the legend of the stock ticker."C. and R. closed yesterday at twenty-six," he commented.Then,
swinging back in his chair, "What's Stolz doing?""For one thing, he has made Miss Fagin his private stenographer,"
replied Hood."Now we will begin to get real information," he
remarked."Tell Miss Fagin you will give her fifty dollars a week from
now on; but she is to deliver to you a carbon copy of every letter she
writes for Stolz.And I want those copies on my desk every morning
when I come down.Hood," he continued, abruptly turning the
conversation, "what have you dug up about Ketchim's new company?""Very little, sir," replied Hood with a trace of embarrassment."His
lawyer is a fledgeling named Cass, young, but wise enough not to talk.I called on him yesterday afternoon to have a little chat about the
old Molino company, representing that I was speaking for certain
stockholders.But he told me to bring the stockholders in and he would
talk with them personally."Ames laughed, while the lawyer grinned sheepishly."Is that the sort
of service you are rendering for a hundred-thousand-dollar salary?""Hood, I'm ashamed of you!""I can't blame you; I am ashamed of myself," replied the lawyer."Well," continued Ames good-naturedly, "leave Ketchim to me.I've got
three men now buying small amounts of stock in his various companies.I'll call for receiverships pretty soon, and we will see this time
that he doesn't refund the money.Now about other matters: the Albany
post trolley deal is to go through.Work up
the details and let me have them at once.Have you got the senate bill
drawn for Gossitch?"As it stands now, the repealing
section gives any city the right to grant saloon licenses of
indefinite length, instead of for one year."We want the bill so drawn that it will become
practically impossible to revoke a license.""As it now reads," said Hood, "it makes a saloon license assignable.That creates a property right that can hardly be revoked.""As I figure, it will create a value of some
twenty millions for those who own saloons in New York.And if the United States ever reaches the point
where it will have to buy the saloons in order to wipe them out, it
will face a very handsome little expenditure."Ames, a very large part of the stock of American brewing
companies is owned in Europe.How are you--"

"Nominally, it is.But for two years, and more, I have been quietly
gathering in brewing stock from abroad, and to-day I have some ten
millions in my own control, from actual purchases, options, and so
forth.I'm going to organize a holding company, when the time arrives,
and I figure that within the next year or so we will practically
control the production of beer and spirituous liquors in the United
States and Europe.The formation of that company will be a task worthy
of your genius, Hood.""It will be a pleasure to undertake it," replied Hood with animation.Ames, I got in touch with Senator Mall last evening
at the club, and he assures me that the senate committee have so
changed the phraseology of the tariff bill on cotton products that the
clause you wish retained will be continued with its meaning unaltered.In fact, the discrimination which the hosiery interests desire will be
fully observed.Your suggestion as to an ad valorem duty of fifty per
cent on hose valued at less than sixty-five cents a dozen pairs is
exceptionally clever, in view of the fact that there are none of less
than that value.""Triumphant Republicanism," he commented."And
right in the face of the President's message.Wire Mall that I will be
in Washington Thursday evening to advise with him further about it.Hood, we've got a fight on in regard to
the President's idea of granting permission in private suits to use
judgments and facts brought out and entered in government suits
against combinations.And the
regulation of security issues of railroads--preposterous!If Mall and Gossitch and Wells don't oppose
that in the Senate, I'll see that they are up before the lunacy
commission--and I have some influence with that body!""There is nothing to fear, I think," replied Hood reassuringly."An
important piece of business legislation like that will hardly go
through this session.And then we will have time to prepare to
frustrate it.The suggestion to place the New York Stock Exchange
under government supervision is a much more serious matter, I think.""See here, Hood," said Ames, leaning forward and laying a hand upon
that gentleman's knee, "when that happens, we'll have either a
Socialist president or a Catholic in the White House, with Rome
twitching the string.Then I shall move to my Venezuelan estates, take
the vow of poverty, and turn monk.""Which reminds me again that by your continued relations with Rome you
are doing much to promote just that state of affairs," returned the
lawyer sententiously."But I find the Catholic Church
convenient--indeed, necessary--for the promotion of certain plans.But I shall
abruptly sever my relations with that institution some day--when I am
through with it.At present I am milking the Church to the extent of a
brimming pail every year; and as long as the udder is full and
accessible I shall continue to tap it.I tapped the Presbyterian
Church, through Borwell, last year, if you remember."Willett, chief secretary to Ames, entered at that moment with the
morning mail, opened and sorted, and replies written to letters of
such nature as he could attend to without suggestions from his chief."By the way," remarked Hood when he saw the letters, "I had word from
Collins this morning that he had secured a signed statement from that
fellow Marcus, who was crushed in the Avon mills yesterday.Marcus
accepted the medical services of our physicians, and died in our
hospital.Just before he went off, his wife accepted a settlement of
one hundred dollars.Looked big to her, I guess, and was a bird in the
hand."That reminds me," said Ames, looking up from his mail; "we are going
to close the mills earlier this year on account of the cotton
shortage.""Four thousand hands idle for three months, I suppose.we just escaped disaster last year, you remember.""It will be more than three months this time," commented Ames with a
knowing look.Then--"Hood, I verily believe you are a coward."Ames," replied the latter slowly, "I certainly would
hesitate to do some of the things you do.Yet you seem to get away
with them.""Perk up, Hood," laughed Ames."I've got real work for you as soon as
I get control of C. and R. I'm going to put you in as president, at a
salary of one hundred thousand per annum.Then you are going to buy
the road for me for about two million dollars, and I'll reorganize and
sell to the stockholders for five millions, still retaining control.The road is only a scrap heap, but its control is the first step
toward the amalgamation of the trolley interests of New England.Laws
are going to be violated, Hood, both in actual letter and in spirit.It's up to you to get around the
Interstate Commerce Commission in any way you can, and buttress this
little monopoly against competition and reform-infected legislatures."We'll send Crabbe to the Senate," Ames coolly replied."You seem to forget that senators are now elected by the people, Mr.The people are New York City, Buffalo, and
Albany.And Tammany at present is in my pocket.Buffalo and Albany can be swept by the Catholic vote.And I have that
in the upper right hand drawer of my private file.The 'people' will
therefore elect to the Senate the man I choose.In fact, I prefer
direct election of senators over the former method, for the people are
greater fools _en masse_ than any State Legislature that ever
assembled."He took up another letter from the pile on his desk and glanced
through it."Protests against the way
you nullified the Glaze-Bassett red-light injunction bill.I really didn't think it was in you."said Hood, puffing a little with
pride.But for that, the passage of the bill would have wiped out the
whole red-light district, and quartered the rents I now get from my
shacks down there.Now next year we will be better prepared to fight
the bill.The press will be with us then--a little cheaper and a
trifle more degraded than it is to-day."Ames read it and handed
it to his lawyer."The _Proteus_ has reached the African Gold Coast at
last," he said.Then he threw back his head and laughed heartily."Do
you know, Hood, the _Proteus_ carried two missionaries, sent to the
frizzle-topped Zulus by Borwell and his outfit.Deutsch and Company
cable that they have arrived.""But," said Hood in some perplexity, "the cargo of the _Proteus_ was
rum!""Just so," roared Ames; "that's where the joke comes in.I make it a
point that every ship of mine that carries a missionary to a foreign
field shall also carry a cargo of rum.The combination is one that the
Zulu finds simply irresistible!""So," commented Hood, "the Church goes down to Egypt for help!""I carry the missionaries free on my rum
boats.Great saving to the Board of Foreign Missions, you know."Hood looked at the man before him in undisguised admiration of his
cunning."And did you likewise send missionaries to China with your
opium cargoes?""I once sent Borwell himself to Hongkong on a boat
loaded to the rails with opium.We had insisted on his taking a needed
vacation, and so packed him off to Europe.In Bombay I cabled him to
take the _Crotus_ to Hongkong, transportation free.That was my last
consignment of opium to China, for restrictions had already fallen
upon our very Christian England, and the opium traffic was killed.I
had plans laid to corner the entire opium business in India, and I'd
have cleaned up a hundred million out of it, but for the pressure of
public sentiment.However, we're going to educate John Chinaman to
substitute whiskey for opium.But now," glancing at the great electric
wall clock, "I've wasted enough time with you.By the way, do you know
why this Government withheld recognition of the Chinese Republic?""No," replied Hood, standing in anticipation."Thirty thousand chests of opium," returned Ames laconically."Ames and Company had advanced to the English banks of Shanghai and
Hongkong half this amount, loaned on the opium.That necessitated a
few plain words from me to the President, and a quick trip from
Washington to London afterwards to interview his most Christian
British Majesty.A very pleasant and profitable trip, Hood, very!Hood threw his chief another look of intense admiration, and left the
room."Get Lafelle here some time to-day when I have a vacant hour,"
commanded Ames."Cable to acting-Bishop Wenceslas, of Cartagena, and
ask him if an American mining company is registered there under the
name of Simiti Development Company, and what properties they have and
where located.Tell him to cable reply, and follow with detailed
letter."He leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes."The Congregation of
the Sacred Index has laid the ban on--what's the name of the book?"He
drew out a card-index drawer and selected a card, which he tossed to
the secretary.He seemed to
muse a while, then went on slowly."Carlos Madero, of Mexico, is in
New York.Learn where he is staying, and arrange an interview for me.Wire Senator Wells, Washington, that the bill for a Children's Bureau
must not be taken from the table.Wire the Sequana Coal
Company that I want their report to-morrow, without fail.Wire
Collins, at Avon, to tell the Spinners' Union I have nothing to
discuss with them.As Hood was chief of the Ames legal department, and Willett the chief
of his army of secretaries, so Hodson was the captain of his force of
brokers, a keen, sagacious trader, whose knowledge of the market and
whose ability in the matter of stock trading was almost uncanny."What's your selection for to-day, Hodson?"asked Ames, as the man
entered.Hodson laid on his desk three lists of suggested deals on the
exchanges of New York, London, and Paris.Ames glanced over them
hurriedly, drawing his pencil through certain that did not meet his
approval, and substituting others in which for particular reasons he
wished to trade that morning."What's your reason for thinking I ought
to buy Public Utilities?""They have the letting of the Hudson river tunnel contract," replied
Hodson.Ames studied the broker's face a moment.Then his own brightened, as
he began to divine the man's reason.he ejaculated, "you
think there's quicksand along the proposed route?""I know it," said Hodson calmly."Pick up ten thousand shares, if you can get them," returned Ames
quickly.Then--"I'm going to attend a meeting of the Council of
American Grain Exchanges at two to-day.I want you to be just outside
the door."Ames concluded, "I guess that's all.I'm at the bank at ten; at the Board of Trade at ten-thirty; Stock
Exchange at eleven; and lunch at Rector's at twelve sharp, returning
here immediately afterward."Hodson again bowed, and left the office to undertake his various
commissions.For the next half hour Ames pored over the morning's quota of letters
and messages, making frequent notes, and often turning to the
telephone at his hand.Then he summoned a stenographer and rapidly
dictated a number of replies."In my next vacant hour, following the one devoted to Lafelle, I want
to see Reverend Darius Borwell," he directed."Also," he continued,
"wire Strunz that I want a meeting of the Brewers' Union called at the
earliest possible date.By the way, ask Lafelle if he can spend the
night with me on board the _Cossack_, and if so, notify Captain
McCall.Here is a bundle of
requests for charity, for contributions to hospitals, orphan asylums,
and various homes.'Phone to the
City Assessor to come over whenever you can arrange an hour and go
over my schedule with me.By the way, tell Hood to take steps at once
to foreclose on the Bradley estate.Did you find out where Ketchim
does his banking?""Yes, sir," replied the secretary, "the Commercial State.""Very well, get the president, Mr.A few moments later Ames had purchased from the Commercial State bank
its note against the Ketchim Realty Company for ten thousand dollars."I thought Ketchim would be borrowing again," he chuckled, when he had
completed the transaction."His brains are composed of a disastrous
mixture of hypocrisy and greed.I've thrown another hook into him
now."At nine forty-five Ames left his private office and descended in his
elevator to the banking house on the second floor.He entered the
directors' room with a determined carriage, nodding pleasantly to his
associates.Taking his seat as chairman, he promptly called the
meeting to order.Some preliminary business occupied the first few minutes, and then
Ames announced:

"Gentlemen, when the State of New York offered the public sixty
millions of four per cent bonds last week, and I advised you to take
them at a premium of six per cent, you objected.I overruled you, and
the bank bought the bonds.Within forty-eight hours they were resold
at a premium of seven per cent, and the bank cleared six hundred
thousand.Now let me suggest that the
psychology of this transaction is worth your study.A commodity is a
drug on the market at one dollar, until somebody is willing to pay a
dollar and a half for it.Then a lot of people will want it, until
somebody else offers a bid of two.Then the price will soar, and the
number of those who covet the article and scramble for it will
increase proportionably.A murmur of admiration rose from the directors."I think," said one,
"that we had better send Mr.Ames to Washington to confer with the
President in regard to the proposed currency legislation.""That is already arranged," put in Ames."I meet the President next
Thursday for a conference on this matter.""Why, in that case," returned Ames with a knowing smile, "I think we
had better give him a little lesson to take out of office with
him--one that will ruin his second-term hopes--and then close our
bank."From the bank, the Board of Trade, the Stock Exchange, and his
luncheon with Senator Gossitch, Ames returned to his office for the
private interviews which his chief secretary had arranged.Then
followed further consultations with Hood over the daily, weekly, and
monthly reports which Ames required from all the various commercial,
financial, and mining enterprises in which he was interested; further
discussions of plans and schemes; further receipt and transmission of
cable, telegraphic, and telephone messages; and meetings with his
heads of departments, his captains, lieutenants, and minor officers,
to listen to their reports and suggestions, and to deliver his quick,
decisive commands, admonitions, and advice.From eight in the morning
until, as was his wont, Ames closed his desk and entered his private
elevator at five-thirty in the evening, his office flashed with the
superenergy of the man, with his intense activity, his decisive words,
and his stupendous endeavors, materialistic, absorptive, ruthless
endeavors.If one should ask what his day really amounted to, we can
but point to these incessant endeavors and their results in augmenting
his already vast material interests and his colossal fortune, a
fortune which Hood believed ran well over a hundred millions, and
which Ames himself knew multiplied that figure by five or ten.And the
fortune was increasing at a frightful pace, for he gave nothing, but
continually drew to himself, always and ever drawing, accumulating,
amassing, and absorbing, and for himself alone.Snapping his desk shut, he held a brief conversation over the wire
with the Beaubien, then descended to his waiting car and was driven
hastily to his yacht, the _Cossack_, where Monsignor Lafelle awaited
as his guest.It was one of the few pleasures which Ames allowed
himself during the warm months, to drop his multifarious interests and
spend the night aboard the _Cossack_, generally alone, rocking gently
on the restless billows, so typical of his own heaving spirit, as the
beautiful craft steamed noiselessly to and fro along the coast, well
beyond the roar of the huge _arena_ where human beings, formed of
dust, yet fatuously believing themselves made in the image of infinite
Spirit, strive and sweat, curse and slay, in the struggle to prove
their doubtful right to live.CHAPTER 13


The _Cossack_, with its great turbines purring like a sleeping kitten,
and its twin screws turning lazily, almost imperceptibly in the dark
waters, moved through the frosty night like a cloud brooding over the
deep.Yet it was a cloud of tremendous potentiality, enwrapping a
spirit of energy incarnate.From far aloft its burning eye pierced a
channel of light through the murky darkness ahead.In its wake it drew
a swell of sparkling phosphorescence, which it carelessly tossed off
on either side as a Calif might throw handfuls of glittering coins to
his fawning beggars.From somewhere in the structure above, the
crackling, hissing wireless mechanism was thrusting its invisible
hands out into the night and catching the fleeting messages that were
borne on the intangible pulsations of the mysterious ether.From time
to time these messages were given form and body, and despatched to the
luxurious suite below, where, in the dazzling sheen of silver and cut
glass, spread out over richest napery, and glowing beneath a torrent
of white light, sat the gigantic being whose will directed the
movements of this floating palace."You see, Lafelle, I look upon religion with the eye of the
cold-blooded business man, without the slightest trace of sentimentalism.From the business standpoint, the Protestant Church is a dead failure.It doesn't get results that are in any way commensurate with its
investment.But your Church is a success--from the point of dollars and
cents.In fact, in the matter of forming and maintaining a monopoly, I
take off my hat to the Vatican.Every day I learn something of value by studying your methods of
operating upon the public.And so you see why I take such pleasure in
talking with really astute churchmen like yourself."Monsignor Lafelle studied the man without replying, uncertain just
what interpretation to put upon the remark.The Japanese servant was
clearing away the remnants of the meal, having first lighted the
cigars of the master and guest."Now," continued Ames, leaning back in his luxurious chair and musing
over his cigar, "the purgatory idea is one of the cleverest schemes
ever foisted upon the unthinking masses, and it has proved a veritable
Klondike.if I could think up and put over a thing like that I'd
consider myself really possessed of brains."Ames," he replied adroitly, "you
do not know your Bible."I don't suppose I ever in my life read a whole
chapter in the book.I can't swallow such stuff, Lafelle--utterly
unreasonable, wholly inconsistent with facts and natural laws, as we
know and are able to observe them.Even as a child I never had any
use for fairy-tales, or wonder-stories.I always wanted facts,
tangible, concrete, irrefutable facts, not hypotheses.The Protestant
churches hand out a mess of incoherent guesswork, based on as many
interpretations of the Bible as there are human minds sufficiently
interested to interpret it, and then wax hot and angry when
hard-headed business men like myself refuse to subscribe to it.If they had anything tangible to
offer, it would be different.But I go to church for the looks of
the thing, and for business reasons; and then stick pins into myself
to keep awake while I listen to pedagogical Borwell tell what he
doesn't know about God and man.Then at the close of the service I
drop a five-dollar bill into the plate for the entertainment, and
go away with the feeling that I didn't get my money's worth.From a
business point of view, a Protestant church service is worth about
twenty-five cents for the music, and five cents for the privilege of
sleeping on a soft cushion.So you see I lose four dollars and
seventy cents every time I attend.You Catholic fellows, with your
ceremonial and legerdemain, give a much better entertainment.Besides, I like to hear your priests soak it to their cowering
flocks.""I shall have to class you with the incorrigibles," he
said with a rueful air."I am sorry you take such a harsh attitude
toward us.We are really more spiritual--"

Ames interrupted with a roar of laughter."Why, Lafelle, you old fraud, I look upon your
Church as a huge business institution, a gigantic trust, as mercenary
and merciless as Steel, Oil, or Tobacco!Why, you and I are in the
same business, that of making money!And I'd like to borrow some of
your methods.Only, you've got it over me, for you
hurl the weight of centuries of authority upon the poor, trembling
public; and I have to beat them down with clubs of my own making.Moreover, the law protects you in all your pious methods; while I have
to hire expensive legal talent to get around it.""You seem to be fairly successful, even at that," retorted Lafelle.Then, too politic to draw his host into an acrimonious argument that
might end in straining their now cordial and mutually helpful
friendship, he observed, looking at his cigar: "May I ask what you pay
for these?--for only an inexhaustible bank reserve can warrant their
like."He had struck the right chord, and Ames softened at once."These," he
said, tenderly regarding the thick, black weed in his fingers, "are
grown exclusively for me on my own plantation in Colombia.They cost
me about one dollar and sixty-eight cents each, laid down at my door
in New York.I searched the world over before I found the only spot
where such tobacco could be grown."continued Lafelle, lifting his glass of sparkling
champagne."On a little hillside, scarcely an acre in extent, in Granada, Spain,"
replied Ames."I have my own wine press and bottling plant there."Lafelle could not conceal his admiration for this man of luxury."And
does your exclusiveness extend also to your tea and coffee?""I grow tea for my table in both China and
Ceylon.And I have exclusive coffee plantations in Java and Brazil.But I'm now negotiating for one in Colombia, for I think that, without
doubt, the finest coffee in the world is grown there, although it
never gets beyond the coast line.""_Fortuna non deo_," murmured the churchman; "you man of chance and
destiny!""My friend," said he, "I have always insisted
that I possessed but a modicum of brains; but I am a gambler.With ordinary judgment and horse-sense, I take risks that
no so-called sane man would consider.The curse of the world is
fear--the chief instrument that you employ to hold the masses to your
churchly system.I know that as long as a
business opponent has fear to contend with, I am his master.Fear is
at the root of every ailment of mind, body, or environment.I repeat,
I know not the meaning of the word.Hence my position in the business
world.Hence, also, my freedom from the limitations of superstition,
religious or otherwise."Yes," replied Lafelle, drawing a long sigh, "in a sense I do.But you
greatly err, my friend, in deprecating your own powerful intellect.I
know of no brain but yours that could have put South Ohio Oil from one
hundred and fifty dollars up to over two thousand a share.I had a few
shares of that stock myself."Sorry I didn't know about it," he said.I didn't own a dollar's worth of South Ohio.Oh,
yes," he added, as he saw Lafelle's eyes widening in surprise, "I
pushed the market up until a certain lady, whom you and I both know,
thought it unwise to go further, and then I sprung the sudden
discovery of Colombian oil fields on them; and the market crashed
like a burst balloon.The lady cleared some two millions on the rig.No, I didn't have a drop of Colombian oil to grease the chute.It was
American nerve, that's all.""If you had lived in the Middle Ages you'd
have been burnt for possessing a devil!""On the contrary," quickly amended Ames, his eyes twinkling, "I'd have
been made a Cardinal."Both men laughed over the retort; and then Ames summoned the valet to
set in motion the great electrical pipe-organ, and to bring the
whiskey and soda.For the next hour the two men gave themselves up to the supreme luxury
of their magnificent environment, the stimulation of their beverage
and cigars, and the soothing effect of the soft music, combined with
the gentle movement of the boat.Then Ames took his guest into the
smoking room proper, and drew up chairs before a small table, on which
were various papers and writing materials."Now," he began, "referring to your telephone message of this morning,
what is it that you want me to do for you?Is it the old question of
establishing a nunciature at Washington?"Lafelle had been impatiently awaiting this moment.He therefore
plunged eagerly into his subject.Ames," said he, "I know you to
have great influence at the Capital.In the interests of humanity, I
ask you to use that influence to prevent the passage of the
immigration bill which provides for a literacy test."There was no need of this request; for, in the
interests, not of humanity, but of his own steamship companies, he
intended that there should be no restriction imposed upon immigration.But the Church was again playing into his hands, coming to him for
favors.And the Church always paid heavily for his support.he exclaimed with an assumption of interest, "so you ask me to
impugn my own patriotism!""I don't quite understand," he said."Why," Ames explained, "how long do you figure it will take, with
unrestricted immigration, for the Catholics to so outnumber the
Protestants in the United States as to establish their religion by law
and force it into the schools?""But your Constitution provides toleration for all
religions!""And the Constitution is quite flexible, and wholly subject to
amendment, is it not?"Lafelle flared out in unrestrained anger."What a bugaboo you
Protestants make of Roman Catholicism!"Why,
one would think that we Catholics were all anarchists!Are we such a
menace, such a curse to your Republican institutions?Do you ever stop
to realize what the Church has done for civilization, and for your
own country?And where, think you, would art and learning be now but
for her?Have you any adequate idea what the Church is doing
to-day for the poor, for the oppressed?You Protestants,
a thousand times more intolerant than we, treat us as if we were
Hindoo pariahs!This whole country is suffering from the delirium of
Roman Catholic-phobia!"There, my friend, calm yourself," soothed Ames, laying a hand on the
irate churchman's arm."And please do not class me with the
Protestants, for I am not one of them.You Catholic fellows have made
admirable gains in the past few years, and your steady encroachments
have netted you about ninety per cent of all the political offices in
and about Washington, so you have no complaint, even if the Church
isn't in politics.Meantime, his brain was working
rapidly."By the way, Lafelle," he said, abruptly resuming the
conversation, "you know all about church laws and customs, running way
back to mediaeval times.Can't you dig up some old provision whereby I
can block a fellow who claims to own a gold mine down in Colombia?If
you can, I'll see that the President vetoes every obnoxious
immigration bill that's introduced this term."Lafelle roused from his sulk and gulped down his wrath.Ames went on
to express his desire for vengeance upon one obscure Philip O. Ketchim,
broker, promoter, church elder, and Sunday school superintendent.Then at length Ames rose and rang for his valet."My God, Lafelle, the
idea's a corker!""From a book entitled 'Confessions of a Roman
Catholic Priest,' written anonymously, but, they say, by a young
attache of the Vatican who was insane at the time.However, he was apparently well informed on matters Colombian.""The law of _'en manos muertas'_," replied Lafelle."Well," exclaimed Ames, "again I take off my hat to your churchly
system!And now," he continued eagerly, "cable the Pope at once.I'll
have the operator send your code ashore by wireless, and the message
will go to Rome to-night.Tell the old man you've got influence at
work in Washington that is--well, more than strong, and that the
prospects for defeating the immigration bill are excellent."Lafelle arose and stood for a moment looking about the room."Before I
retire, my friend," he said, "I would like to express again the
admiration which the tasteful luxury of this smoking room has aroused
in me, and to ask, if I may, whether those stained-glass windows up
there are merely fanciful portraits?"Ames quickly glanced up at the faces of the beautiful women portrayed
in the rectangular glass windows which lined the room just below the
ceiling.They were exquisitely painted, in vivid colors, and so set as
to be illuminated during the day by sunlight, and at night by strong
electric lamps behind them."Because," returned Lafelle, "if I mistake not, I have seen a portrait
similar to that one," pointing up at one of the windows, where a sad,
wistful face of rare loveliness looked down upon them.In his complete absorption he had not noticed the
effect of his query upon Ames."I do not know," he replied slowly."London--Paris--Berlin--no, not there.And yet, it was in Europe, I am
sure."In the--Royal Gallery--at Madrid!""Yes," continued Lafelle confidently, still studying the portrait, "I
am certain of it.But," turning abruptly upon Ames, "you may have
known the original?""I assure you I never had that
pleasure," he said lightly."These art windows were set in by the
designer of the yacht.Adds much to the
general effect, don't you think?By the way, if a portrait similar to
that one hangs in the Royal Gallery at Madrid, you might try to learn
the identity of the original for me.It's quite interesting to feel
that one may have the picture of some bewitching member of royalty
hanging in his own apartments.By all means try to learn who the lady
is--unless you know."He stopped and searched the churchman's face.But--that picture
has haunted me from the day I first saw it in the Royal Gallery."Crafts, of 'Storrs and Crafts,'" replied Ames.Lafelle moved thoughtfully toward the door.The valet appeared at that
moment."Show Monsignor to his stateroom," commanded Ames."Good night,
Monsignor, good night.Remember, we dock at seven-thirty, sharp."Returning to the table, Ames sat down and rapidly composed a message
for his wireless operator to send across the dark waters to the city,
and thence to acting-Bishop Wenceslas, in Cartagena.This done, he
extinguished all the lights in the room excepting those which
illuminated the stained-glass windows above.Drawing his chair up in
front of the one which had stirred Lafelle's query, he sat before it
far into the morning, in absorbed contemplation, searching the sad
features of the beautiful face, pondering, revolving, sometimes
murmuring aloud, sometimes passing a hand across his brow, as if he
would erase from a relentless memory an impression made long since and
worn ever deeper by the recurrent thought of many years.CHAPTER 14


Almost within the brief period of a year, the barefoot, calico-clad
Carmen had been ejected from unknown Simiti and dropped into the midst
of the pyrotechnical society life of the great New World metropolis.Only an unusual interplay of mental forces could have brought about
such an odd result.But that it was a very logical outcome of the
reaction upon one another of human ambitions, fears, lust, and greed,
operating through the types of mind among which her life had been
cast, those who have followed our story thus far can have no doubt.The cusp of the upward-sweeping curve had been reached through the
insane eagerness of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to outdo her wealthy society
rivals in an arrogant display of dress, living, and vain, luxurious
entertaining, and the acquisition of the empty honor attaching to
social leadership.The coveted prize was now all but within the
shallow woman's grasp.she knew not that when her itching
fingers closed about it the golden bauble would crumble to ashes.The program as outlined by the Beaubien had been faithfully followed.Hawley-Crowles--whom, of course, she
had long desired to know more intimately--and an interchange of calls
had ensued, succeeded by a grand reception at the Ames mansion, the
first of the social season.Hawley-Crowles floated, as
upon a cloud, attired in a French gown which cost fifteen hundred
dollars, and shoes on her disproportioned feet for which she had
rejoiced to pay thirty dollars each, made as they had been from
specially selected imported leather, dyed to match her rich robe.It
was true, her pleasure had not been wholly unalloyed, for she had been
conscious of a trace of superciliousness on the part of some of the
gorgeous birds of paradise, twittering and hopping in their hampering
skirts about the Ames parlors, and pecking, with milk-fed content, at
the rare cakes and ices.But she only held her empty head the higher,
and fluttered about the more ostentatiously and clumsily, while
anticipating the effect which her charming and talented ward would
produce when she should make her bow to these same vain, haughty
devotees of the cult of gold.And she had wisely planned that Carmen's
_debut_ should follow that of Kathleen Ames, that it might eclipse her
rival's in its wanton display of magnificence.On the heels of the Ames reception surged the full flood of the
winter's social orgy.Early in November Kathleen Ames was duly
presented.The occasion was made one of such stupendous display that
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles first gasped, then shivered with apprehension,
lest she be unable to outdo it.She went home from it in a somewhat
chastened frame of mind, and sat down at her _escritoire_ to make
calculations.Could she on her meager annual income of one hundred and
fifty thousand hope to meet the Ames millions?She had already allowed
that her wardrobe would cost not less than twenty-five thousand
dollars a year, to say nothing of the additional expense of properly
dressing Carmen.But she now saw that this amount was hopelessly
inadequate.She therefore increased the figure to seventy-five
thousand.Could she maintain her
city home, entertain in the style now demanded by her social position,
and spend her summers at Newport, as she had planned?No, her income would not suffice; she would be obliged to
draw on the principal until Carmen could be married off to some
millionaire, or until her own father died.if he would only
terminate his useless existence soon!But, in lieu of that delayed desideratum, some expedient must be
devised at once.That obscure, retiring
woman was annually making her millions.A tip now and then from her, a
word of advice regarding the market, and her own limited income would
expand accordingly.She had not seen the Beaubien since becoming a
member of Holy Saints.But on that day, and again, two months later,
when the splendid altar to the late lamented and patriotic citizen,
the Honorable James Hawley-Crowles, was dedicated, she had marked the
woman, heavily veiled, sitting alone in the rear of the great church.She had shuddered as she
thought the tall, black-robed figure typified an ominous shadow
falling athwart her own foolish existence.But there was no doubt of Carmen's hold on the strange, tarnished
woman.And so, smothering her doubts and pocketing her pride, she
again sought the Beaubien, ostensibly in regard to Carmen's
forthcoming _debut_; and then, very adroitly and off-handedly, she
brought up the subject of investments, alleging that the added burden
of the young girl now rendered it necessary to increase the rate of
interest which her securities were yielding.The Beaubien proved herself the soul of candor and generosity.Not
only did she point out to Mrs.Hawley-Crowles how her modest income
might be quadrupled, but she even offered, in such a way as to make it
utterly impossible for that lady to take offense, to lend her whatever
amount she might need, at any time, to further Carmen's social
conquest.And during the conversation she announced that she herself
was acting on a suggestion dropped by the great financier, Ames, and
was buying certain stocks now being offered by a coming power in world
finance, Mr.Hawley-Crowles had heard of this man!Was he not
promoting a company in which her sister's husband, and the girl
herself, were interested?And if such investments were good enough for
a magnate of Ames's standing, they certainly were good enough for her.Indeed, why had she not thought of
this before!She would get Carmen to hypothecate her own interest in
this new company, if necessary.That interest of itself was worth a
fortune.Hawley-Crowles and Carmen so desired, the
Beaubien would advance them whatever they might need on that
security alone.Or, she would take the personal notes of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles--"For, you know, my dear," she said sweetly, "when
your father passes away you are going to be very well off, indeed, and
I can afford to discount that inevitable event somewhat, can I
not?"Hawley-Crowles soared into the empyrean, and this
self-absorbed woman, who never in her life had earned the equivalent
of a single day's food, launched the sweet, white-souled girl of
the tropics upon the oozy waters of New York society with such
_eclat_ that the Sunday newspapers devoted a whole page, profusely
illustrated, to the gorgeous event and dilated with much extravagance
of expression upon the charms of the little Inca princess, and
upon the very important and gratifying fact that the three hundred
fashionable guests present displayed jewels to the value of not less
than ten million dollars.The function took the form of a musicale, in which Carmen's rich
voice was first made known to the _beau monde_.The girl instantly
swept her auditors from their feet.The splendid pipe-organ, which
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles had hurriedly installed for the occasion,
became a thing inspired under her deft touch.It seemed in that
garish display of worldliness to voice her soul's purity, its
wonder, its astonishment, its lament over the vacuities of this
highest type of human society, its ominous threats of thundered
denunciation on the day when her tongue should be loosed and the
present mesmeric spell broken--for she was under a spell, even
that of this new world of tinsel and material veneer.Gannette wept on Carmen's shoulder, and went
home vowing that she would be a better woman and cut out her night-cap
of Scotch-and-soda.Others crowded about the girl and showered their
fulsome praise upon her.Ames and her daughter
Kathleen.They stared at the lovely _debutante_ with wonder and
chagrin written legibly upon their bepowdered visages.And before the
close of the function Kathleen had become so angrily jealous that she
was grossly rude to Carmen when she bade her good night.For her own
feeble light had been drowned in the powerful radiance of the girl
from Simiti.And from that moment the assassination of the character
of the little Inca princess was decreed.But, what with incessant striving to adapt herself to her environment,
that she might search its farthest nook and angle; what with ceaseless
efforts to check her almost momentary impulse to cry out against the
vulgar display of modernity and the vicious inequity of privilege
which she saw on every hand; what with her purity of thought; her rare
ideals and selfless motives; her boundless love for humanity; and her
passionate desire to so live her "message" that all the world might
see and light their lamps at the torch of her burning love for God and
her fellow-men, Carmen found her days a paradox, in that they were
literally full of emptiness.After her _debut_, event followed event
in the social life of the now thoroughly gay metropolis, and the poor
child found herself hustled home from one function, only to change her
attire and hurry again, weary of spirit, into the waiting car, to be
whisked off to another equally vapid.It seemed to the bewildered girl
that she would never learn what was _de rigueur_; what conventions
must be observed at one social event, but amended at another.Her
tight gowns and limb-hampering skirts typified the soul-limitation of
her tinsel, environment; her high-heeled shoes were exquisite torture;
and her corsets, which her French maid drew until the poor girl gasped
for air, seemed to her the cruellest device ever fashioned by the
vacuous, enslaved human mind.Frequently she changed her clothing
completely three and four times a day to meet her social demands.Night became day; and she had to learn to sleep until noon.She found
no time for study; none even for reading.And conversation, such as
was indulged under the Hawley-Crowles roof, was confined to insipid
society happenings, with frequent sprinklings of racy items anent
divorce, scandal, murder, or the debauch of manhood.From this she
drew more and more aloof and became daily quieter.It was seldom, too, that she could escape from the jaded circle of
society revelers long enough to spend a quiet hour with the Beaubien.But when she could, she would open the reservoirs of her soul and give
full vent to her pent-up emotions."Oh," she would often exclaim, as
she sat at the feet of the Beaubien in the quiet of the darkened music
room, and gazed into the crackling fire, "how can they--how can
they!"Then the Beaubien would pat her soft, glowing cheek and murmur, "Wait,
dearie, wait."And the tired girl would sigh and close her eyes and
dream of the quiet of little Simiti and of the dear ones there from
whom she now heard no word, and yet whom she might not seek, because
of the war which raged about her lowly birthplace.The gay season was hardly a month advanced when Mrs.Ames angrily
admitted to herself that her own crown was in gravest danger.The
South American girl--and because of her, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her
blase sister--had completely captured New York's conspicuous circle.Hawley-Crowles apparently did not lack for funds, but entertained
with a display of reckless disregard for expense, and a carelessness
of critical comment, that stirred the city to its depths and aroused
expressions of wonder and admiration on every hand.The newspapers
were full of her and her charming ward.Surely, if the girl's social
prestige continued to soar, the Ames family soon would be relegated to
the social "has-beens."Ames and her haughty daughter held
many a serious conference over their dubious prospects.Night after night, when the Beaubien's dinner
guests had dispersed, he would linger to discuss the social war now in
full progress, and to exchange with her witty comments on the
successes of the combatants.One night he announced, "Lafelle is in
England; and when he returns he is coming by way of the West Indies.I
shall cable him to stop for a week at Cartagena, to see Wenceslas on a
little matter of business for me."Hawley-Crowles has become
nicely enmeshed in his net," she returned."The altar to friend Jim is
a beauty.Also, I hear that she is going to finance Ketchim's mining
company in Colombia.""I learned to-day that Ketchim's engineer, Harris,
has returned to the States.Couldn't get up the Magdalena river, on
account of the fighting.There will be nothing doing there for a year
yet.""Just as well," commented the Beaubien.Then abruptly--"By the way, I
now hold Mrs.Hawley-Crowles's notes to the amount of two hundred and
fifty thousand dollars.I want you to buy them from me and be ready to
turn the screws when I tell you."he exclaimed, pinching her
cheek.I'll take them off your hands to-morrow.And by the
way, I must meet this Carmen.""You let her alone," said the Beaubien quickly in a low voice.*       *       *       *       *

The inauguration of the Grand Opera season opened to Mrs.Hawley-Crowles
another avenue for her astonishing social activities.With rare
shrewdness she had contrived to outwit Mrs.Ames and secure the center
box in the "golden horseshoe" at the Metropolitan.There, like a gaudy
garden spider in its glittering web, she sat on the opening night,
with her rapt _protegee_ at her side, and sent her insolent challenge
broadcast.Multimillionaires and their haughty, full-toileted dames were
ranged on either side of her, brewers and packers, distillers and
patent medicine concoctors, railroad magnates and Board of Trade
plungers, some under indictment, others under the shadow of death,
all under the mesmeric charm of gold.In the box at her left sat the
Ames family, with their newly arrived guests, the Dowager Duchess of
Altern and her son.Ames was smiling
and affable when she exchanged calls with the gorgeous occupants of
the Hawley-Crowles box."So chawmed to meet you," murmured the heir of Altern, a callow youth
of twenty-three, bowing over the dainty, gloved hand of Carmen.Then,
as he adjusted his monocle and fixed his jaded eyes upon the fresh
young girl, "Bah Jove!"The gigantic form of Ames wedged in between the young man and Carmen."I've heard a lot about you," he said genially, in a heavy voice that
harmonized well with his huge frame; "but we haven't had an
opportunity to get acquainted until to-night."For some moments he stood holding her hand and looking steadily at
her.The girl gazed up at him with her trustful brown eyes alight, and
a smile playing about her mouth.While she chatted brightly Ames held her hand and laughed at her
frank, often witty, remarks.But then a curious, eager look came into
his face, and he became quiet and reflective.He seemed unable to take
his eyes from her.And when the girl gently drew her hand from his he
laughed again, nervously."I--I know something about Colombia," he said, "and speak the language
a bit.We'll have to get together often, so's I can brush up."Hawley-Crowles and her sister for the
first time--"Oh, so glad to see you both!Camorso's in fine voice
to-night, eh?"He wheeled about and stood again looking at Carmen, until she blushed
under his close gaze and turned her head away.But throughout the evening, whenever the girl looked in the
direction of the Ames family, she met the steady, piercing gaze of the
man's keen gray eyes.And they seemed to her like sharp steel points,
cutting into the portals of her soul.Night after night during the long season Carmen sat in the box and
studied the operas that were produced on the boards before her
wondering gaze.Hawley-Crowles was with her.And
generally, too, the young heir of Altern was there, occupying the
chair next to the girl--which was quite as the solicitous Mrs."Aw--deucedly fine show to-night, Miss Carmen," the youth ventured one
evening, as he took his accustomed place close to her."The music is always beautiful," the girl responded."But the play,
like most of Grand Opera, is drawn from the darkest side of human
life.It is a sordid picture of licentiousness and cruelty.Only for
its setting in wonderful music, Grand Opera is generally such a
depiction of sex-passion, of lust and murder, that it would not be
permitted on the stage.A few years from now people will be horrified
to remember that the preceding generation reveled in such blood
scenes--just as we now speak with horror of the gladiatorial contests
in ancient Rome.""But--aw--Miss Carmen," he
hazarded, "we must be true to life, you know!"Having delivered
himself of this oracular statement, the youth adjusted his monocle and
settled back as if he had given finality to a weighty argument."You voice the cant of the modern
writer, 'true lo life.'True to the horrible, human sense of life,
that looks no higher than the lust of blood, and is satisfied with it,
I admit.True to the unreal, temporal sense of existence, that is here
to-day, and to-morrow has gone out in the agony of self-imposed
suffering and death.True to that awful, false sense of life which we
must put off if we would ever rise into the consciousness of _real_
life, I grant you.But the production of these horrors on the stage,
even in a framework of marvelous music, serves only to hold before us
the awful models from which we must turn if we would hew out a better
existence.Are you the better for seeing an exhibition of wanton
murder on the stage, even though the participants wondrously sing
their words of vengeance and passion?""But--aw--they serve as warnings; they show us the things we ought not
to do, don't you know.""The sculptor who would chisel a beautiful form, does he
set before him the misshapen body of a hunchback, in order that he may
see what not to carve?""And we who would transform the
human sense of life into one of freedom from evil, can we build a
perfect structure with such grewsome models as this before us?You
don't see it now," she sighed; "you are in the world, and of it; and
the world is deeply under the mesmeric belief of evil as a stern
reality.But the day is coming when our musicians and authors will
turn from such base material as this to nobler themes--themes which
will excite our wonder and admiration, and stimulate the desire for
purity of thought and deed--themes that will be beacon lights, and
true guides.Hawley-Crowles frowned heavily as she listened to this
conversation, and she drew a sigh of relief when Carmen, sensing the
futility of any attempt to impress her thought upon the young man,
turned to topics which he could discuss with some degree of
intelligence.Late in the evening Ames dropped in and came directly to the
Hawley-Crowles box.He brought a huge box of imported candy and a
gorgeous bouquet of orchids, which he presented to Carmen.Hawley-Crowles beamed upon him like the effulgent midday sun."Kathleen wants you, Reggy," Ames abruptly announced to the young man,
whose lips were molding into a pout.His huge bulk loomed over the younger man like a
mountain as he took him by the shoulders and turned him toward the
exit.protested the youth, with a vain show
of resistance.Ames said nothing; but his domineering personality forced the boy out
of the box and into the corridor.Then he took the seat which his evicted nephew
had vacated, and bent over Carmen.With a final hopeless survey of the
situation, Reginald turned and descended to the cloak room, muttering
dire but futile threats against his irresistible relative.Ames's manner unconsciously assumed an air of
patronage."This is the first real opportunity I've had to talk with
you.Tell me, what do you think of New York?""Well," she began uncertainly, "since I have
thawed out, or perhaps have become more accustomed to the cold, I have
begun to make mental notes.But they
are not yet classified, and so I can hardly answer your question, Mr.But I am sure of one thing, and that is that for the first few
months I was here I was too cold to even think!""Yes," he agreed, "the change from the tropics was
somewhat abrupt."It is like awaking from a deep sleep," answered Carmen meditatively."In Simiti we dream our lives away.In New York all is action; loud
words; harsh commands; hurry; rush; endeavor, terrible, materialistic
endeavor!Every person I see seems to be going somewhere.He may not
know where he is going--but he is on the way.He may not know why he
is going--but he must not be stopped.He has so few years to live; and
he must pile up money before he goes.He must own an automobile; he
must do certain things which his more fortunate neighbor does, before
his little flame of life goes out and darkness falls upon him.I
sometimes think that people here are trying to get away from
themselves, but they don't know it.I think they come to the opera
because they crave any sort of diversion that will make them forget
themselves for a few moments, don't you?"well, I can't say," was Ames's meaningless reply, as he sat
regarding the girl curiously."And," she continued, as if pleased to have an auditor who at least
pretended to understand her, "the thing that now strikes me most
forcibly is the great confusion that prevails here in everything, in
your government, in your laws, in your business, in your society, and,
in particular, in your religion.Why, in that you have hundreds of
sects claiming a monopoly of truth; you have hundreds of churches,
hundreds of religious or theological beliefs, hundreds of differing
concepts of God--but you get nowhere!Why, it has come to such a pass
that, if Jesus were to appear physically on earth to-day, I am sure he
would be evicted from his own Church!""Well, yes, I guess that's so," commented Ames, quite at sea in such
conversation."But we solid business men have found that religious
emotion never gets a man anywhere.Makes a man
effeminate, and utterly unfits him for business.I wouldn't have a man
in my employ who was a religious enthusiast.""But Jesus was a religious enthusiast," she protested."I doubt if there ever was such a person," he answered dryly."Why, the Bible--"

"Is the most unfortunate and most misunderstood piece of literature
ever written," he interrupted."And the Church, well, I regard it as
the greatest fraud ever perpetrated upon the human race.""You mean that to apply to every church?"But their thoughts were running in widely divergent
channels.The conversational topic of the moment had no interest
whatsoever for the man.But this brilliant, sparkling girl--there was
something in those dark eyes, that soft voice, that brown hair--by
what anomaly did this beautiful creature come out of desolate,
mediaeval Simiti?Ames, you do not know what religion is.""It is that which binds us to God."No, he knew not the meaning of the word.His thought
broke restraint and flew wildly back--but he caught it, and rudely
forced it into its wonted channel.But, did he love his fellow-men?What would that profit him in dollars and cents?The thought brought a cynical laugh to
his lips.Carmen looked up at him wonderingly."You will have to, you
know," she said quixotically.Then she reached out a hand and laid it on his.He looked down at it,
so soft, so white, so small, and he contrasted it with the huge, hairy
bulk of his own.He felt it, felt
himself yielding.He was beginning to look beyond the beautiful
features, the rare grace and charm of physical personality, which had
at first attracted only the baser qualities of his nature, and was
seeing glimpses of a spiritual something which lay back of all
that--infinitely more beautiful, unspeakably richer, divine, sacred,
untouchable."Of course you will attend the Charity Ball, Mr.Hawley-Crowles jarred upon his ear like a shrill discord."But I shall be represented by my family.Hawley-Crowles, taking the query to
herself."That is, if my French dressmaker does not fail me.She
arched her brows at him as she propounded this innocent question."I'll tell you what it is this year," he sagely
replied.He gave a sententious nod of
his head."I overheard Kathleen and her mother discussing plans.And--do you want to know next season's innovation?He stopped and laughed heartily at his own treasonable
deceit.Hawley-Crowles eagerly, as she drew her
chair closer."One condition," replied Ames, holding up a thick finger."Well, I want to get better acquainted with your charming ward," he
whispered."Of course; and I want you to know her better." wigs," said Ames, with a knowing look.Hawley-Crowles settled back with a smile of supreme satisfaction.She would boldly anticipate next season at the coming Charity Ball.Then, leaning over toward Ames, she laid her fan upon his arm."Can't
you manage to come and see us some time, my sister and Carmen?"Just call me up a little in advance."The blare of trumpets and the crash of drums drew their attention
again to the stage.A business
associate in a distant box had beckoned him.Hawley-Crowles
dismissed him reluctantly; then turned her wandering attention to the
play.But Carmen sat shrouded in thoughts that were not stimulated by the
puppet-show before her.The tenor shrieked out his tender passion, and
the tubby soprano sank into his inadequate arms with languishing
sighs.Carmen heeded not their stage amours.She saw in the glare
before her the care-lined face of the priest of Simiti; she saw the
grim features and set jaw of her beloved, black-faced Rosendo, as he
led her through the dripping jungle; she saw Anita's blind, helpless
babe; she saw the little newsboy of Cartagena; and her heart welled
with a great love for them all; and she buried her face in her hands
and wept softly.CHAPTER 15

"Wait, my little princess, wait," the Beaubien had said, when Carmen,
her eyes flowing and her lips quivering, had again thrown herself into
that strange woman's arms and poured out her heart's surcease."I want to go back to Simiti, to Padre Jose, to my home," wailed the
girl."I don't understand the ways and the thoughts of these people.They don't know God--they don't know what love is--they don't know
anything but money, and clothes, and sin, and death.When I am with
them I gasp, I choke--"

"Yes, dearest, I understand," murmured the woman softly, as she
stroked the brown head nestling upon her shoulder.And many even of the 'four hundred' are suffering from the
same disease; but they would die rather than admit it.To no one could the attraction which had drawn Carmen and the Beaubien
together seem stranger, more inexplicable, than to that lone woman
herself.And both acknowledged it, nor
would have had it otherwise.To Carmen, the Beaubien was a sympathetic
confidante and a wise counselor.The girl knew nothing of the woman's
past or present life.She tried to see in her only the reality which
she sought in every individual--the reality which she felt that Jesus
must have seen clearly back of every frail mortal concept of humanity.And in doing this, who knows?--she may have transformed the sordid,
soiled woman of the world into something more than a broken semblance
of the image of God.To the Beaubien, this rare child, the symbol of
love, of purity, had become a divine talisman, touching a dead soul
into a sense of life before unknown.If Carmen leaned upon her, she,
on the other hand, bent daily closer to the beautiful girl; opened her
slowly warming heart daily wider to her; twined her lonely arms daily
closer about the radiant creature who had come so unexpectedly into
her empty, sinful life."But, mother dear"--the Beaubien had long since begged Carmen always
to address her thus when they were sharing alone these hours of
confidence--"they will not listen to my message!They laugh and jest
about real things!"And yet you tell me that the Bible says wise men
laughed at the great teacher, Jesus."And his message--oh, mother dearest, his message would have
helped them so, if they had only accepted it!It would have changed
their lives, healed their diseases, and saved them from death.And my
message"--her lip quivered--"my message is only his--it is the message
of love.But--I am so out of place among them.Their talk is so coarse, so
low and degraded.They don't
know what miserable failures they all are.Hawley-Crowles--"

The Beaubien's jaw set.--she will not let me speak of God in her house.She told me to keep
my views to myself and never voice them to her friends.And she says I
must marry either a millionaire or a foreign noble."And become a snobbish expatriate!Marry a decadent count, and
then shake the dust of this democratic country from your feet forever!Go to London or Paris or Vienna, and wear tiaras and coronets, and
speak of disgraceful, boorish America in hushed whispers!She forgets that the tarnished name she bears was
dragged up out of the ruck of the impecunious by me when I received
Jim Crowles into my house!And that I gave him what little gloss he
was able to take on!""Mother dear--I would leave them--only, they need love, oh, so much!"The Beaubien strained her to her bosom."They need you, dearie; they
little realize how they need you!I, myself, did not know until you
came to me.There, I didn't mean to let those tears get away from
me."She laughed softly as Carmen looked up anxiously into her face."Now come," she went on brightly, "we must plan for the Charity
Ball."A look of pain swept over the girl's face.The Beaubien bent and
kissed her."You will not leave society
voluntarily.They
will light their own lamps at yours--or they will thrust you from
their doors.And then," she muttered, as her teeth snapped together,
"you will come to me."Close on the heels of the opera season followed the Charity Ball, the
Horse Show, and the Fashion Show in rapid succession, with numberless
receptions, formal parties, and nondescript social junketings
interspersed.During these fleeting hours of splash and glitter Mrs.Hawley-Crowles trod the air with the sang-froid and exhilaration of an
expert aviator.Backed by the Beaubien millions, and with the
wonderful South American girl always at her right hand, the
worldly ambitious woman swept everything before her, cut a social
swath far wider than the glowering Mrs.Ames had ever attempted, and
marched straight to the goal of social leadership, almost without
interference.She had apparently achieved other successes, too, of
the first importance.She had secured the assistance of Ames himself
in matters pertaining to her finances; and the Beaubien was
actively cooeperating with her in the social advancement of Carmen.It is true, she gasped whenever her thought wandered to her notes
which the Beaubien held, notes which demanded every penny of her
principal as collateral.And she often meditated very soberly over
the large sums which she had put into the purchase of Simiti stock,
at the whispered suggestions of Ames, and under the irresistibly
pious and persuasive eloquence of Philip O. Ketchim, now president
of that flourishing but as yet non-productive company.But then, one
day, an idea occurred to her, and she forthwith summoned Carmen into
the library."You see, my dear," she said, after expounding to the girl certain of
her thoughts anent the famous mine, "I do not want Mr.Ketchim to have
any claim upon you for the expense which he incurred on account of
your six months in the Elwin school.That thought, as well as others
relating to your complete protection, makes it seem advisable that you
transfer to me your share in the mine, or in the Simiti company.See,
I give you a receipt for the same, showing that you have done this as
part payment for the great expense to which I have been put in
introducing you to society and in providing for your wants here.It is
merely formal, of course.And it keeps your share still in our
family, of which you are and always will be a member; but yet removes
all liability from you.Of course, you know nothing about business
matters, and so you must trust me implicitly.Which I am sure you do,
in view of what I have done for you, don't you, dear?"Of course Carmen did; and of course she unhesitatingly transferred her
claim on La Libertad to the worthy Mrs.Whereupon the
good woman tenderly kissed the innocent child, and clasped a string of
rich pearls about the slender, white neck.And Carmen later told the
Beaubien, who said nothing, but frowned darkly as she repeated the
tidings over her private wire to J. Wilton Ames.But that priest of
finance only chuckled and exclaimed: "Excellent, my dear!By the way, I had a cable from Lafelle this morning, from
Cartagena.But the
Beaubien hung up the receiver with a presentiment that everything was
far from right, despite his bland assurance.And she regretted
bitterly now that she had not warned Carmen against this very thing.The Charity Ball that season was doubtless the most brilliant function
of its kind ever held among a people who deny the impossible.The
newspapers had long vied with one another in their advertisements and
predictions; they afterward strove mightily to outdo themselves in
their vivid descriptions of the gorgeous _fete_.The decorative
effects far excelled anything ever attempted in the name of
"practical" charity.The display of gowns had never before been even
closely approximated.The scintillations from jewels whose value
mounted into millions was like the continuous flash of the electric
spark.And the huge assemblage embraced the very cream of the
nobility, the aristocracy, the rich and exclusive caste of a great
people whose Constitution is founded on the equality of men, and who
are wont to gather thus annually for a few hours to parade their
material vestments and divert their dispirited mentalities under the
guise of benefaction to a class for whom they rarely hold a loving
thought.Hawley-Crowles had planned and executed a _coup_.Ames had subscribed the munificent sum of twenty-five thousand
dollars to charity a week before the ball.Hawley-Crowles had
waited for this.Then she gloated as she telephoned to the various
newspaper offices that her subscription would be fifty thousand.Did
she give a new note to the Beaubien for this amount?That she
did--and she obtained the money on the condition that the little Inca
princess should lead the grand march.Hawley-Crowles
knew that she must gracefully yield first place to the South American
girl; and yet she contrived to score a triumph in apparent defeat.Ames and her daughter Kathleen at the
last moment refused to attend the function, alleging fatigue from a
season unusually exacting.Hawley-Crowles had
previously secured the languid young Duke of Altern as a partner for
Carmen--and then was most agreeably thwarted by Ames himself, who,
learning that his wife and daughter would not attend, abruptly
announced that he himself would lead the march with Carmen.Was it not quite proper that the city's leading man of
finance should, in the absence of his wife and daughter, and with
their full and gratuitous permission--nay, at their urgent request, so
it was told--lead with this fair young damsel, this tropical flower,
who, as rumor had it, was doubtless a descendant of the royal dwellers
in ancient Cuzco?"Quite proper, _O tempora, O mores_!"murmured one Amos A. Hitt,
erstwhile Presbyterian divine, explorer, and gentleman of leisure, as
he settled back in his armchair in the fashionable Weltmore apartments
and exhaled a long stream of tobacco smoke through his wide nostrils."And, if I can procure a ticket, I shall give myself the pleasure of
witnessing this sacred spectacle, produced under the deceptive mask of
charity," he added.In vain the Beaubien labored with Ames when she learned of his
intention--though she said nothing to Carmen.Ames had yielded to her
previously expressed wish that he refrain from calling at the
Hawley-Crowles mansion, or attempting to force his attentions upon the
young girl.But in this matter he remained characteristically
obdurate.For the angry
Beaubien, striving to shield the innocent girl, had vented her
abundant wrath upon the affable Ames, and had concluded her
denunciation with a hint of possible exposure of certain dark facts of
which she was sole custodian.Ames smiled, bowed, and courteously
kissed her hand, as he left her stormy presence; but he did not yield.Through the perfumed air and the garish light tore the crashing notes
of the great band.The loud hum of voices ceased, and all eyes turned
to the leaders of the grand march, as they stepped forth at one end of
the great auditorium.Then an involuntary murmur arose from the
multitude--a murmur of admiration, of astonishment, of envy.The
gigantic form of Ames stood like a towering pillar, the embodiment of
potential force, the epitome of human power, physical and mental.His
massive shoulders were thrown back as if in haughty defiance of
comment, critical or commendatory.The smile which flitted about his
strong, clean-shaven face bespoke the same caution as the gentle
uplifting of a tiger's paw--behind it lay all that was humanly
terrible, cunning, heartless, and yet, in a sense, fascinating.His
thick, brown hair, scarcely touched with gray, lay about his great
head like a lion's mane.He raised a hand and gently pushed it back
over the lofty brow.Then he bent and offered an arm to the slender
wisp of a girl at his side.murmured a tall, angular man in the crowd."I don't know, Hitt," replied the friend addressed."But they say she
belongs to the Inca race."The graceful girl moving by the side of her giant escort seemed like a
slender ray of light, a radiant, elfish form, transparent, intangible,
gliding softly along with a huge, black shadow.She was simply clad,
all in white.About her neck hung a string of pearls, and at her waist
she wore the rare orchids which Ames had sent her that afternoon.No one marked the pure simplicity of her attire.The absence of sparkling jewels and resplendent raiment evoked no
comment.The multitude saw but her wonderful face; her big eyes,
uplifted in trustful innocence to the massive form at her side; her
rich brown hair, which glittered like string-gold in the strong light
that fell in torrents upon it.There's a nimbus about her head!""I could almost believe it," whispered that gentleman, straining his
long neck as she passed before him.Immediately behind Carmen and Ames strode the enraptured Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who saw not, neither heard, and who longed for no
further taste of heaven than this stupendous triumph which she had won
for herself and the girl.Her heavy, unshapely form was squeezed into
a marvelous costume of gold brocade.A double ballet ruffle of stiff
white tulle encircled it about the hips as a drapery.The bodice was
of heavy gold net.A pleated band of pale moire, in a delicate shade
of pink, crossed the left shoulder and was caught at the waist in a
large rose bow, ambassadorial style.A double necklace of diamonds,
one bearing a great pendant of emeralds, and the other an alternation
of emeralds and diamonds, encircled her short, thick neck.A diamond
coronet fitted well around her wonderful amber- wig--for, true
to her determination, she had anticipated the now _passee_ Mrs.Ames
and had boldly launched the innovation of  wigs among the smart
set.An ivory, hand-painted fan, of great value, dangled from her
thick wrist.And, as she lifted her skirts to an unnecessary height,
the gaping people caught the glitter of a row of diamonds in each
high, gilded heel.At her side the young Duke of Altern shuffled, his long, thin body
curved like a kangaroo, and his monocle bent superciliously upon the
mass of common clay about him."Aw, beastly crush, ye know," he
murmured from time to time to the unhearing dame at his right.And
then, as she replied not, he fell to wondering if she fully realized
who he was.Around and across the great hall the gorgeous pageant swept.The
big-mouthed horns bellowed forth their noisy harmony.In the distant
corridors great illuminated fountains softly plashed.At the tables
beyond, sedulous, touting waiters were hurriedly extracting corks from
frosted bottle necks.The rare porcelain and cut glass shone and
glittered in rainbow tints.The revelers waxed increasingly merry and
care-free as they lightly discussed poverty over rich viands and
sparkling Burgundy.Still further beyond, the massive oak doors, with
their leaded-glass panes, shut out the dark night and the bitter
blasts of winter.And they shut out, too, another, but none the less
unreal, externalization of the mortal thought which has found
expression in a social system "too wicked for a smile.""God, no--I'd get arrested!The frail, hungry woman who stood before the great doors clutched her
wretched shawl closer about her thin shoulders.Her teeth chattered as
she stood shivering in the chill wind.At the corner of the building the cold blast almost swept her off her
feet.A man, dirty and unkempt, who had been waiting in an alley, ran
out and seized her."I say, Jude, ain't ye goin' in?Git arrested--ye'd spend the night in
a warm cell, an' that's better'n our bunk, ain't it?""I'm goin' to French Lucy's," the woman whispered hoarsely.Ye've lost yer looks, Jude, an' ol' Lucy ain't a-goin' to take
ye in.We gotta snipe somepin quick--or starve!Look, we'll go down to
Mike's place, an' then come back here when it's out, and ye kin pinch
a string, or somepin, eh?For a moment she stood listening
to the music from within.A sob shook her, and she began to cough
violently.The man took her arm, not unkindly; and together they moved
away into the night.*       *       *       *       *

"Well, little girl, at last we are alone.He had, late in the evening,
secured seats well hidden behind a mass of palms, and thither had led
Carmen.Ever see
anything like this in Simiti?"She was
glad to get away for a moment from the crowd, from the confusion, and
from the unwelcome attentions of the now thoroughly smitten young Duke
of Altern."No," she finally made answer, "I didn't know there were such things
in the world."A new toy--one that would last a long time."Yes," he went on genially, "I'll wager there's millions of dollars'
worth of jewelry here to-night.""And are the people going to sell it and give the
money to the poor?""But--this is a--a charity--"

"Oh, I see.No, it's the money derived from the sale of
tickets that goes to the poor.""But--aren't you interested in the poor?""Of course, of course," he hastened to assure her, in his easy casual
tone.For a long time the girl sat reflecting, while he studied her,
speculating eagerly on her next remark.Then it came abruptly:

"Mr.Ames, I have thought a great deal about it, and I think you
people by your charity, such as this, only make more charity
necessary.Why don't you do away with poverty altogether?"Well, that's quite impossible, you know.'The poor
ye have always with you', eh?She was
deeply serious, for charity to her meant love, and love was all in
all."No," she finally replied, shaking her head, "you do _not_ know your
Bible.It is the poor thought that you have always with you, the
thought of separation from good.And that thought becomes manifested
outwardly in what is called poverty."He regarded her quizzically, while a smile played about his mouth."Why don't you get at the very root of the trouble, and destroy the
poverty-thought, the thought that there can be any separation from
God, who is infinite good?""Well, my dear girl, as for me, I don't know anything about God.As
for you, well, you are very innocent in worldly matters.Poverty, like
death, is inevitable, you know.""Well, well," he returned brightly, "that's good news!Then there is
no such thing as 'the survival of the fittest,' and the weak needn't
necessarily sink, eh?"Ames, that
you have survived as one of the fittest?"Well, now--what would you say about that?""I should say decidedly no," was the blunt reply.A dark shade crossed his face, and he bit his lip.People did not
generally talk thus to him.And yet--this wisp of a girl!how beautiful, as she sat there
beside him, her head erect, and her face delicately flushed.He
reached over and took her hand."You are the kind," she went on, "who give money to the poor, and then
take it away from them again.All the money which these rich people
here to-night are giving to charity has been wrested from the poor.And you give only a part of it back to them, at that.This Ball is
just a show, a show of dress and jewels.Why, it only sets an example
which makes others unhappy, envious, and discontented."My dear little girl," he said in a patronizing tone, "don't you think
you are assuming a great deal?I'm sure I'm not half so bad as you
paint me.""Well, the money you give away has got to come from
some source, hasn't it?And you manipulate the stock market and put
through wheat corners and all that, and catch the poor people and take
their money from them!But your idea of charity makes
me pity you.Up here I find a man can pile up hundreds of millions by
stifling competition, by debauching legislatures, by piracy and
legalized theft, and then give a tenth of it to found a university,
and so atone for his crimes.Oh, I know a lot
about such things!I've been studying and thinking a great deal since
I came to the United States."And there was a touch of
aspersion in his voice."I've come with a message," she replied eagerly."Well," he said sharply, "let me warn and advise you: don't join the
ranks of the muck-rakers, as most ambitious reformers with messages
do.I can tear down as easily as you or
anybody else.But to build something better is entirely another
matter.""Well, what is it, if I may
ask?"Well, perhaps that's so," he said, bending toward her and
again attempting to take her hand."I guess," she said, drawing back quickly, "you don't know what love
is, do you?""Of course I will," she said brightly.And you'll have to do just as I tell you," holding up an admonitory
finger."I'm yours to command, little woman," he returned in mock seriousness."Well," she began very softly, "you must first learn that love is just
as much a principle as the Binomial Theorem in algebra.And you must apply it just as you would apply any
principle, to everything."You sweet little thing," he murmured absently, gazing down into her
glowing face.I
wonder--I wonder if you really are a daughter of the Incas.""Yes," she said, "I am a
princess."You look like--I wonder--pshaw!"And--do you know?--I wish I might
be your prince."But then her bright
smile faded, and she looked off wistfully down the long corridor."I'll send him a challenge
to-night!""No," she murmured gently, "you can't.And,
oh, he was so good to me!He made me leave that country on account of
the war."This innocent girl little knew that one of
the instigators of that bloody revolution sat there beside her.Then a
new thought flashed into his brain."What is the full name of this
priest?""Jose--Jose de Rincon," she whispered reverently.Jose de Rincon--of Simiti--whom Wenceslas had made the scapegoat of
the revolution!And who, according to a
recent report from Wenceslas, had been arrested and--

"A--a--where did you say this--this Jose was, little girl?"You know, he never was a priest at heart.But, though he saw the
truth, in part, he was not able to prove it enough to set himself
free; and so when I came away he stayed behind to work out his
problem.And he will work it all out," she mused abstractedly, looking
off into the distance; "he will work it all out and come--to me.I
am--I am working with him, now--and for him.And--" her voice dropped
to a whisper, "I love him, oh, so much!"His mouth opened; then shut again with a
sharp snap.That beautiful creature now belonged to him, and to none
other!Were there other claimants, he would crush them without mercy!As for this apostate priest, Jose--humph!if he still lived he should
rot the rest of his days in the reeking dungeons of San Fernando!"When he comes to me," she said softly, "we are
going to give ourselves to the whole world.""And--perhaps--perhaps, by that time, you will be--be--"

"Well?"snapped the man, irritated by the return of her thought to
himself.Perhaps by that time you will--you will love everybody," she
murmured."Perhaps you won't go on piling up big mountains of money
that you can't use, and that you won't let anybody else use.""You will know then that Jesus founded his great empire on love.Your
empire, you know, is human business.But you will find that such
empires crumble and fall."Say," he exclaimed, turning full upon her and seeming to bear her
down by his tremendous personality, "you young and inexperienced
reformers might learn a few things, too, if your prejudices could be
surmounted.Has it ever occurred to you that we men of business think
not so much about accumulating money as about achieving success?Do
you suppose you could understand that money-making is but a side issue
with us?""Yes," the girl went on, as if in quiet soliloquy, "I suppose you
are--a tremendous worldly success.And this Ball--it is a splendid
success, too.Thousands of dollars will be raised for the poor.And
then, next year, the same thing will have to be done again.Your
charities cost you hundreds of millions every year up here.And,
meantime, you rich men will go right on making more money at the
expense of your fellow-men--and you will give a little of it to the
poor when the next Charity Ball comes around.It's like a circle,
isn't it?"she said, smiling queerly up at him."It has no end, you
know."Ames had now decided to swallow his annoyance and meet the girl with
the lance of frivolity."Yes, I guess that's so," he began."But of
course you will admit that the world is slowly getting better, and
that world-progress must of necessity be gradual.We can't reform all
in a minute, can we?""I don't know how fast you might reform if you
really, sincerely tried.And if
you, a great, big, powerful man, with the most wonderful opportunities
in the world, should really try to be a success, why--well, I'm sure
you'd make very rapid progress, and help others like you by setting
such a great example.For you are a wonderful man--you really are."Ames looked at her long and quizzically.Then
he took her hand, this time without resistance."Tell me, little girl--although I know there can be no doubt of
it--are you a success?"he ejaculated, "would
you mind telling me just why?"She smiled up at him, and her sweet trustfulness drew his sagging
heartstrings suddenly taut."Because," she said simply, "I strive every moment to 'acquire that
mind which was in Christ Jesus.'"From amusement to wonder, to irritation, to
anger, then to astonishment, and a final approximation to something
akin to reverent awe had been the swift course of the man's emotions
as he sat in this secluded nook beside this strange girl.The
poisoned arrows of his worldly thought had broken one by one against
the shield of her protecting faith.His badinage had returned to
confound himself.The desire to possess had utterly fled before the
conviction that such thought was as wildly impossible as iniquitous.Then he suddenly became conscious that the little body beside him had
drawn closer--that it was pressing against him--that a little hand had
stolen gently into his--and that a soft voice, soft as the summer
winds that sigh among the roses, was floating to his ears."To be really great is to be like that wonderful man, Jesus.It is to
know that through him the great Christ-principle worked and did those
things which the world will not accept, because it thinks them
miracles.It is to know that God is love, and to act that knowledge.It is to know that love is the Christ-principle, and that it will
destroy every error, every discord, everything that is unlike itself.It is to yield your present false sense of happiness and good to the
true sense of God as infinite good.It is to bring every thought into
captivity to this Christ-principle, love.It is to stop looking at
evil as a reality.It is to let go your hold on it, and let it fade
away before the wonderful truth that God is everywhere, and that there
isn't anything apart from Him.*       *       *       *       *

How long they sat in the quiet that followed, neither knew.Then the
man suffered himself to be led silently back to the ball room again.And when he had recovered and restored his worldly self, the bright
little image was no longer at his side."Stand here, Jude, an' when they begins to come out to their gasoline
carts grab anything ye can, an' git.The shivering woman crept closer to the curb, and the man slouched
back against the wall close to the exit from which the revelers would
soon emerge.A distant clock over a jeweler's window chimed the hour
of four.A moment later the door opened, and a lackey came out and
loudly called the number of the Hawley-Crowles car.That ecstatically
happy woman, with Carmen and the obsequious young Duke of Altern,
appeared behind him in the flood of light.As the big car drew softly up, the wretched creature whom the man had
called Jude darted from behind it and plunged full at Carmen.But the
girl had seen her coming, and she met her with outstretched arm.The
glare from the open door fell full upon them.With a quick movement the girl
tore the string of pearls from her neck and thrust it into Jude's
hand.The latter turned swiftly and darted into the blackness of the
street.Then Carmen hurriedly entered the car, followed by her
stupefied companions.It had all been done in a moment of time.Hawley-Crowles, when she had recovered her
composure sufficiently to speak.And the Duke of Altern rubbed his weak eyes
and tried hard to think.Hawley-Crowles sought her bed that morning the east was
red with the winter sun."The loss of the pearls is bad enough," she
exclaimed in conclusion, glowering over the young girl who sat before
her, "for I paid a good three thousand for the string!But, in
addition, to scandalize me before the world--oh, how could you?And
this unspeakable Jude--and that awful house--heavens, girl!Who would
believe your story if it should get out?"The worried woman's face was
bathed in cold perspiration."But--she saved me from--from that place," protested the harassed
Carmen."She was poor and cold--I could see that.Why should I have
things that I don't need when others are starving?"Hawley-Crowles shook her weary head in despair.Reed, who had sat fixing the girl with her cold eyes throughout the
stormy interview following their return from the ball, now offered a
suggestion."The thing to do is to telephone immediately to all the
newspapers, and say that her beads were stolen last night.""But they weren't stolen," asserted the girl."I gave them to her--"

"Go to your room!"Hawley-Crowles, at the limit of her
endurance."And never, under any circumstances, speak of this affair
to any one--never!"The social crown, which had rested none too securely upon the gilded
wig of the dynamic Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, had been given a jolt that set
it tottering.*       *       *       *       *

It was very clear to Mrs.J. Wilton Ames after the Charity Ball that
she was engaged in a warfare to the death, and with the most
relentless of enemies.Nothing short of the miraculous could now
dethrone the detested Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her beautiful,
mysterious ward.She dolefully acknowledged to herself and to the
sulking Kathleen that she had been asleep, that she had let her foot
slip, and that her own husband's conduct in leading the grand march
with Carmen bade fair to give the _coup de grace_ to a social prestige
which for many weeks had been decidedly on the wane."Mamma, we'll have to think up some new stunts," said the dejected
Kathleen over the teacups the noon following the ball."Why, they've
even broken into the front page of the newspapers with a fake jewelry
theft!Look, they pretend that the little minx was robbed of her
string of pearls last night on leaving the hall.Ames's lip curled in disdain as she read the news item."An Inca
princess, indeed!Why doesn't
somebody take the trouble to investigate her?They'd probably find her
an outcast.""Couldn't papa look her up?"She had no wish to discuss her husband, after
the affair of the previous evening.And, even in disregard of that,
she would not have gone to him with the matter.For she and her
consort, though living under the same roof, nevertheless saw each
other but seldom.At times they met in the household elevator; and for
the sake of appearances they managed to dine together with Kathleen in
a strained, unnatural way two or three times a week, at which times no
mention was ever made of the son who had been driven from the parental
roof.There were no exchanges of confidences or affection, and Mrs.Ames knew but little of the working of his mentality.She was wholly
under the dominance of her masterful husband, merely an accessory to
his mode of existence.He used her, as he did countless others, to
buttress a certain side of his very complex life.As for assistance in
determining Carmen's status, there was none to be obtained from him,
strongly attracted by the young girl as he had already shown himself
to be.Indeed, she might be grateful if the attachment did not lead to
far unhappier consequences!"Larry Beers said yesterday that he had something new," she replied
irrelevantly to Kathleen's question."He has in tow a Persian dervish,
who sticks knives through his mouth, and drinks melted lead, and bites
red-hot pokers, and a lot of such things.Larry says he's the most
wonderful he's ever seen, and I'm going to have him and a real Hindu
_swami_ for next Wednesday evening."New York's conspicuous set indeed would have languished often but for
the social buffoonery of the clever Larry Beers, who devised new
diversions and stimulating mental condiments for the jaded brains of
that gilded cult.His table ballets, his bizarre parlor circuses, his
cunningly devised fads in which he set forth his own inimitable
antics, won him the motley and the cap and bells of this tinseled
court, and forced him well out into the glare of publicity, which was
what he so much desired.And by that much it made him as dangerous as any stupid anarchist who
toils by candle-light over his crude bombs.For by it he taught the
great mass of citizenship who still retained their simple ideals of
reason and respect that there existed a social caste, worshipers of
the golden calf, to whom the simple, humdrum virtues were quite
unendurable, and who, utterly devoid of conscience, would quaff
champagne and dance on the raw, quivering hearts of their fellow-men
with glee, if thereby their jaded appetites for novelty and
entertainment might be for the moment appeased.And so Larry Beers brought his _swami_ and dervish to the Ames
mansion, and caused his hostess to be well advertised in the
newspapers the following day.And he caused the eyes of Carmen to
bulge, and her thought to swell with wonder, as she gazed.And he
caused the bepowdered nose of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles to stand a bit
closer to the perpendicular, while she sat devising schemes to cast a
shade over this clumsy entertainment.The chief result was that, a week later, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, still
running true to form, retorted with a superb imitation of the French
_Bal de l'Opera_, once so notable under the Empire.The Beaubien had
furnished the inspiring idea--and the hard cash."Why do I continue
to lend her money and take her notes?I don't--I don't seem to feel that way now.Or is it because I hate that Ames woman so?I wonder if I do still
hate her?At any rate I'm glad to see Carmen oust the proud hussy from
her place.It's worth all I've spent, even if I burn the notes I hold
against Jim Crowles's widow."And often after that, when at night the Beaubien had sought her bed,
she would lie for hours in the dim light meditating, wondering.I'm not the same woman I was when she came into my life.Oh,
God bless her--if there is a God!"The mock _Bal de l'Opera_ was a magnificent _fete_.All the members of
the smart set were present, and many appeared in costumes representing
flowers, birds, and vegetables.Carmen went as a white rose; and her
great natural beauty, set off by an exquisite costume, made her the
fairest flower of the whole garden.The Duke of Altern, costumed as a
long carrot, fawned in her wake throughout the evening.The tubbily
girthy Gannette, dressed to represent a cabbage, opposed her every
step as he bobbed before her, showering his viscous compliments upon
the graceful creature.Kathleen Ames appeared as a bluebird; and she
would have picked the fair white rose to pieces if she could, so
wildly jealous did she become at the sight of Carmen's further
triumph.About midnight, when the revelry was at its height, a door at the end
of the hall swung open, and a strong searchlight was turned full upon
it.The orchestra burst into the wailing dead march from _Saul_, and
out through the glare of light stalked the giant form of J. Wilton
Ames, gowned in dead black to represent a King Vulture, and with a
blood-red fez surmounting his cruel mask.As he stepped out upon the
platform which had been constructed to represent the famous bridge in
"_Sumurun_," and strode toward the main floor, a murmur involuntarily
rose from the assemblage.It was a murmur of awe, of horror, of fear.The "_monstrum horrendum_" of Poe was descending upon them in the garb
which alone could fully typify the character of the man!When he
reached the end of the bridge the huge creature stopped and distended
his enormous sable wings.cried Gannette, as he thought of his tremendous financial
obligations to Ames.Carmen shuddered and turned away from the awful spectacle."I want to
go," she said to the petrified Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, who had known
nothing of this feature of the program.Straight to the trembling, white-clad girl the great, black vulture
stalked.The revelers fell away from him on either side as he
approached.Carmen turned again and watched him come.A light came into her eyes, and a smile
wreathed her mouth.And when Ames reached her and extended his huge,
black wings again, she walked straight into them with a look of joy
upon her beautiful face.Then the wings closed and completely hid the
fair, white form from the gaping crowd.For a few moments dead silence reigned throughout the hall.Then the
orchestra crashed, the vulture's wings slowly opened, and the girl,
who would have gone to the stake with the same incomprehensible smile,
stepped out.The black monster turned and strode silently, ominously,
back to the end of the hall, crossed the bridge, and disappeared
through the door which opened at his approach.said the shaken Gannette to his perspiring wife.That girl's done for; and Ames has taken this
way to publicly announce the fact!There was another astonished watcher in the audience that evening.It
was the eminent Monsignor Lafelle, recently back from Europe by way of
the West Indies.And after the episode just related, he approached
Carmen and Mrs."A very clever, if startling, performance," he commented; "and with
two superb actors, Mr.Ames and our little friend here," bowing over
Carmen's hand."I am _so_ glad you could accept our invitation, Monsignor.I haven't got my breath yet," panted the steaming Mrs."Do take us, Monsignor, to the refectory.A few moments later, over their iced drinks, Lafelle was relating
vivid incidents of his recent travels, and odd bits of news from
Cartagena."No, Miss Carmen," he said, in reply to her anxious
inquiries, "I did not meet the persons you have mentioned.And as for
getting up the Magdalena river, it would have been quite impossible.Dismiss from your mind all thought of going down there now.And the
little town of Simiti which you mention, I doubt not it is quite shut
off from the world by the war."Carmen turned aside that he might not see the tears which welled into
her eyes."Your entertainment, Madam," continued Lafelle, addressing the now
recovered Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "is superb, as have been all of your
social projects this winter, I learn.The thought which you expressed
to me some months ago regarding Catholic activity in social matters
certainly was well founded.I perceive that our Protestant rivals have
all but retired from the field."Hawley-Crowles swelled with pride.Carmen regarded the churchman
with wonder."And have you not found a sense of peace, of satisfaction and comfort,
since you united with the true Church?""Are you not
at last at rest?""Quite so," sighed the lady, though the sigh was scarcely one of
unalloyed relief."And our little friend here--can she still
remain an alien, now that she has some knowledge of her indebtedness
to the Church?""Why--"

It was now Lafelle's turn to sigh, as he directed himself again to
Mrs."She does not see, Madam, that it was by the
ladder of Holy Church that she mounted to her present enviable social
height.""But--what--what do you mean?""May I not come and explain it to her?"Then he suddenly
thought of his last conversation with the Beaubien.But he shrugged
his shoulders, and a defiant look sat upon his features.Hawley-Crowles dared not refuse the request.She knew she was now
too deeply enmeshed for resistance, and that Lafelle's control over
her was complete--unless she dared to face social and financial ruin.And under that thought she paled and grew faint, for it raised the
curtain upon chaos and black night."Would it be convenient for me to call to-morrow afternoon?"Hawley-Crowles in a scarcely audible
voice."By the way," Lafelle said, suddenly turning the conversation, "how,
may I ask, is our friend, Madam Beaubien?"Hawley-Crowles again trembled slightly."I--I have not seen her
much of late, Monsignor," she said feebly."A strong and very liberal-minded woman," returned Lafelle with
emphasis."I trust, as your spiritual adviser, Madam, I may express
the hope that you are in no way influenced by her."cried Carmen, who had bounded to her feet, her eyes ablaze,
"Madam Beaubien is a noble woman!"Lafelle grasped her hand and drew her back into her
chair.Madam Beaubien is a very dear
friend of ours, and we greatly admire her strength of character.She
certainly does not require your defense!A few moments later he rose and offered his arms to his companions to
lead them back to the hall.Delivering Carmen into the charge of the
eagerly waiting Duke of Altern, Lafelle remarked, as he took leave of
Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, "I trust you will permit me to talk with your
beautiful ward to-morrow afternoon--alone."And when the lady
interpreted the significance of his look, her heart beat rapidly, as
she bowed her acknowledgment of abject submission.ejaculated the young Duke, clutching Carmen."Ye know, I
was deucedly afraid you had gone home, or that Uncle Wilton had you.Ye know, I think I'm jealous of him!"Carmen laughed merrily at the fellow.His grotesque costume made him
appear still more ridiculous."It's nothing to laugh at, Miss Carmen!It's a bally bore to have a
regular mountain like him always getting in the way; and to-night I
just made up my mind I wouldn't stand it any longer, bah Jove!He fixed his monocle savagely in his eye and strode rapidly toward
the refreshment hall.She heard his murmur of
gratification when his gaze lighted upon the chairs and table which
he had evidently arranged previously in anticipation of this
_tete-a-tete_."Ye know," he finally began, after they were seated and he had sat
some minutes staring at the girl, "ye know, you're deucedly clevah,
Miss Carmen!I told mother so to-day, and this time she had to agree.And that about your being an Inca princess--ye know, I could see that
from the very first day I met you.Mighty romantic, and all that,
don't ye know!"replied the girl, her thought drifting back to distant
Simiti."And all about that mine you own in South America--and Mrs.Hawley-Crowles making you her heiress--and all that--bah Jove!It's--it's romantic, I tell you!"His head continued to nod emphasis
to his thought long after he finished speaking."Ye know," he finally resumed, drawing a gold-crested case from a
pocket and lighting a monogrammed cigarette, "a fellow can always tell
another who is--well, who belongs to the aristocracy.Ames, ye
know, said she had some suspicions about you.But I could see right
off that it was because she was jealous.Mother and I knew what you
were the minute we clapped eyes on you.That's because we belong to
the nobility, ye know.""Bah Jove, Miss Carmen, I'm going to say it!""Mother wanted me to marry Lord Cragmont's filly; but, bah Jove, I
say, I'm going to marry you!"Carmen now heard, and she quickly sat up, her eyes wide and staring.You're a princess, ye know,
and so you're in our class.I'm not one of the kind that hands out a
title to the red-nosed daughter of any American pork packer just to
get her money.The girl I marry has got to be my equal.""It's all right for you to have money, of course.I won't marry a
pauper, even if she's a duchess.But you and I, Miss Carmen, are just
suited to each other--wealth and nobility on each side.I've got
thirty thousand good British acres in my own right, bah Jove!"By now Carmen had fully recovered from her surprise.She reflected a
moment, then determined to meet the absurd youth with the spirit of
levity which his audacity merited."But, Reginald," she said in mock
seriousness, "though your father was a duke, how about your mother?Was she not just an ordinary American girl, a sister of plain Mrs.Now on my side--"

"Now, Miss Carmen," cried the boy petulantly, "can't you see that, by
marrying my father, my mother became ennobled?Bah Jove, you don't
understand!he whispered, leaning far over the table toward her."Then we've simply _got_ to marry!""But," protested the girl, "in my country people love those whom they
marry.I haven't heard a word of that from you."It was
love that made me offer you my name and title!""My dear Reginald, you don't love me.You are madly in love, it is true; but it is
with the young Duke of Altern.""See here, you can't talk to me that way, ye know!""Bah Jove, I'm offering to make you a duchess--and I love you, too,
though you may not think it!""Of course you love me, Reginald," said Carmen in gentle reply, now
relinquishing her spirit of badinage; "and I love you.But I do not
wish to marry you."The young man started under the shock and stared at her in utter lack
of comprehension.Was it possible that this unknown girl was refusing
him, a duke?"A--a--I don't get you, Miss Carmen," he stammered."Come," she said, rising and holding out a hand."Let's not talk about
this any more.I do love you, Reginald,
but not in the way that perhaps you would like.I love the real _you_;
not the vain, foolish, self-adoring human concept, called the Duke of
Altern.And the love I feel for you will help you, oh, far more than
if I married you!"I--I expected we'd be engaged--I told mother--"

"Very well, Reginald, we are engaged.Engaged in handling this little
problem that has presented itself to you.And I will help
you to solve it in the right way.Reginald dear, I
didn't mean to treat your proposal so lightly.We're just awfully good friends, aren't we?And I do
love you, more than you think."Leaving the bewildered youth in the hall, Carmen fell afoul of the
very conservative Mrs.Gannette, whose husband, suffering from a sense
of nausea since the appearance of Ames as a King Vulture, had some
moments before summoned his car and driven to his favorite club to
flood his apprehensions with Scotch high-balls.Gannette, shaking a finger at
Carmen."I saw you with Reginald just now.Tell me, dear, when shall we be able to call you the Duchess
of Altern?Carmen's spirits sank, as, without reply, she submitted to the banal
boredom of this blustering dame's society gabble.Gannette hooked
her arm into the girl's and led her to a divan."It's a great affair,
isn't it?"she panted, settling her round, unshapely form out over the
seat.Thought that was better adapted to my shape.But when
I got the cloth form around me, do you know, I couldn't get through
the door!And my unlovely pig of a husband said if I came looking like
that he'd get a divorce."The corpulent dame shook and wheezed with
the expression of her abundant merriment."Well," she continued, "it wasn't his threat that hindered me,
goodness knows!A divorce would be a relief, after living forty years
with him!Speaking of divorce,
he's just got one.Billy Patterson
dared him to exchange wives with him one evening when they were having
a little too much gaiety at the Worley home, and the doctor took the
dare.Kate Worley gets an alimony of
fifty thousand per.Why, he has a
practice of not less than two hundred and fifty thousand a year!""I supposed," murmured Carmen, "that amount of money is a measure of
his ability, a proof of his great usefulness."John moved to the kitchen."He's simply in with the
wealthy, that's all.Carmen glanced at the pale, slender woman across the hall, seated
alone, and wearing a look of utter weariness."I'd like to meet her," she said, suddenly drawn by the woman's mute
appeal for sympathy."She's going to be
dropped.Hawley-Crowles was thinking of to invite her to-night!Her estate is
being handled by Ames and Company, and J. Wilton says there won't be
much left when it's settled--

"My goodness!"she exclaimed, abruptly flitting to another topic.Look at her skirt--flounced at the knees, and
full in the back so's to give a bustle effect.I wish I could wear
togs cut that way--

"They say, my dear," the garrulous old worldling prattled on, "that
next season's styles will be very ultra.Hats
small and round, like the heads of butterflies.Waists and jackets
very full and quite loose in the back and shoulders, so's to give the
appearance of wings.Belts, but no drawing in at the waist.Skirts
plaited, plaits opening wide at the knees and coming close together
again at the ankle, so's to look like the body of a butterfly.Then
butterfly bows sprinkled all over.""Oh dear," she
lamented, "I'd give anything if I had a decent shape!I'd like to wear
those shimmering, flowing, transparent summer things over silk tights.I'd look like a potato busted wide open.Now you can
wear those X-ray dresses all right--

"Say, Kathleen Ames has a new French gown to wear to the Dog Show.Skirt slit clear to the knee, with diamond garter around the leg just
below.Carmen heard little of this vapid talk, as she sat studying the pale
woman across the hall.She had resolved to meet her just as soon as
the loquacious Mrs.But that
genial old gossip gave no present evidence of a desire to change."I'm _so_ glad you're going to marry young Altern," she said, again
swerving the course of her conversation."He's got a fine old ruined
castle somewhere in England, and seems to have wads of money, though I
hear that everything is mortgaged to Ames.Still, his bare title is worth something to an American girl.And you'll do a lot for his family.You know--but
don't breathe a word of this!--his mother never was recognized
socially in England, and she finally had to give up the fight.For a
while Ames backed her, but it wouldn't do.His millions couldn't buy
her the court entree, and she just had to quit.That's why she's over
here now.The old Duke--he was lots older than she--died a couple of
years ago.Ran through everything and drank himself to death.Before
and since that happy event the Duchess did everything under the
heavens to get a bid to court.She gave millions to charity and to
entertainments.You're
a princess, royal Inca, and such like.So you see what you're expected to do for the Altern crowd--

"Dear!catching her breath and switching quickly to another
theme, "have you heard about the Hairton scandal?You see, young Sidney Ames--"

Carmen's patience had touched its limit.she
begged, holding out a hand.Gannette raised her lorgnette and looked at the girl.The scandal's about Ames's son, you know.The
reason he doesn't go in society.You see--"

"My dear Mrs.Gannette," Carmen looked up at her with a beseeching
smile."You wouldn't deliberately give me poison to drink, would
you?"blustered that garrulous lady in astonishment."Then why do you poison my mind with such conversation?""You sit there pouring into my mentality thought after thought that is
deadly poisonous, don't you know it?""You don't mean to harm me, I know," pleaded the girl."But if you
only understood mental laws you would know that every thought entering
one's mind tends to become manifested in some way.Thoughts of
disease, disaster, death, scandal--all tend to become externalized in
discordant ways, either on the body, or in the environment.You don't
want any such things manifested to me, do you?But you might just as
well hand me poison to drink as to sit there and pour such deadly
conversation into me."Gannette slowly drew herself up with the hauteur of a grandee."I do not want to listen to these unreal
things which concern only the human mind," she said earnestly."Nor
should you, if you are truly aristocratic, for aristocracy is of the
thought.I am not going to marry Reginald.But one's thought--that alone is one's claim to _real_
aristocracy.I know I have offended you, but only because I refuse to
let you poison me.She left the divan and the petrified dame, and hurriedly mingled with
the crowd on the floor.Gannette, when she again found
herself.Carmen went directly to the pale woman, still sitting alone, who had
been one of the objects of Mrs.The
woman glanced up as she saw the girl approaching, and a look of wonder
came into her eyes."I am Carmen Ariza," she said simply.The woman roused up and tried to appear composed."Will you ride with me to-morrow?""Then we can talk
all we want to, with nobody to overhear.she
abruptly added, unable longer to withstand the appeal which issued
mutely from the lusterless eyes before her."I am poverty-stricken," returned the woman sadly."But I will give you money," Carmen quickly replied."My dear child," said the woman, "I haven't anything but money.That
is why I am poverty-stricken."the girl exclaimed, sinking into a chair at her side."Well,"
she added, brightening, "now you have me!And will you call me up,
first thing in the morning, and arrange to ride with me?"Yes," she murmured, "I will--gladly."In the small hours of the morning there were several heads tossing in
stubborn wakefulness on their pillows in various New York mansions.CHAPTER 17


On the morning following Mrs.Hawley-Crowles's very successful
imitation of the _Bal de l'Opera_, Monsignor Lafelle paid an early
call to the Ames _sanctum_.And the latter gentleman deemed the visit
of sufficient importance to devote a full hour to his caller.When the
churchman rose to take his leave he reiterated:

"Our friend Wenceslas will undertake the matter for you, Mr.Ames, but
on the conditions which I have named.But Rome must be communicated
with, and the substance of her replies must be sent from Cartagena to
you, and your letters forwarded to her.That might take us into early
summer.Ketchim's engineers will
make any further attempt before that time to enter Colombia.Harris is in Denver, at his old home, you
tell me.So we need look for no immediate move from them.""Quite satisfactory, Lafelle," returned Ames genially."In future, if
I can be of service to you, I am yours to command.Willett will
hand you a check covering your traveling expenses on my behalf."When the door closed after Lafelle, Ames leaned back in his chair and
gave himself up to a moment's reflection."I wonder," he mused, "I
wonder if the fellow has something up his sleeve that he didn't show
me?I'm going to drop him after this trap is
sprung.He's got Jim Crowles's widow all tied up, too.if he begins work on that girl I'll--"

He was interrupted by the ringing of the telephone bell.shouted Ames, "you say the girl insulted your
wife last evening?I don't believe she could--Yes, yes, I mean, I
don't think she meant to--certainly not, no aspersion whatever
intended--What?the girl will have to apologize?--Well!well--No,
not in a thousand years!--Yes, I'll back her!And if your society
isn't good enough for her--and I don't think it is--why, I'll form
a little coterie all by myself!""I want a dozen brokers watching Gannette now until I call them off,"
he commanded."I want you to take personal charge of them."Lucile
already has Gannette pretty well wound up in his Venezuelan
speculations--and they are going to smash--Lafelle has fixed that.And
I've bought her notes against Mrs.Hawley-Crowles for about a
million--which I have reinvested for her in Colombia.She'll
feed out of my hand now!La Libertad is mine when the trap falls.So
is C. and R. And that little upstart, Ketchim, goes to Sing Sing!"He turned to the morning paper that lay upon his desk."I don't like
the way the Colombian revolution drags," he mused."But certainly it
can't last much longer.And then--then--"

His thoughts wandered off into devious channels."So Jose de Rincon
is--well!But--where on earth did
that girl come from?There's a lot of experience coming to
her.And then she'll drop a few of her pious notions.Lucile says--but
Lucile is getting on my nerves!"*       *       *       *       *

Monsignor Lafelle found Mrs.Hawley-Crowles and her ward awaiting him
when his car drove up at two that afternoon.Carmen had not left the
house during the morning, for Elizabeth Wall had telephoned early that
a slight indisposition would necessitate postponement of the
contemplated ride."Well," reflected Carmen, as she turned from the 'phone, "one who
knows that God is everywhere can never be disappointed, for all good
is ever present."And then she set about preparing for the expected
call of Monsignor Lafelle.When that dignitary entered the parlor Mrs.Hawley-Crowles graciously
welcomed him, and then excused herself."I will leave her with you,
Monsignor," she said, indicating Carmen, and secretly glad to escape a
presence which she greatly feared.Lafelle bowed, and then waved
Carmen to a seat."I have come to-day, Miss Carmen," he began easily, "on a mission of
vastest importance as concerning your welfare.I have talked with the acting-Bishop there, who, it seems,
is not wholly unacquainted with you.""Then," cried Carmen eagerly, "you know where Padre Jose is?And the
others--"

"No," replied Lafelle."I regret to say I know nothing of their
present whereabouts."I have long since done that," said Carmen softly."It is of yourself that I wish to speak," continued Lafelle."I have
come to offer you the consolation, the joy, and the protection of the
Church.Hawley-Crowles, has found peace
with us.Will you longer delay taking a step toward which you are by
race, by national custom, and by your Saviour admonished?I have come
to invite you to publicly confess your allegiance to the Church of
Rome.Hawley-Crowles, is one
of us.And you, my
daughter, now need the Church," he added with suggestive emphasis.Hawley-Crowles had hinted the probable
mission of the churchman, and the girl was prepared."I thank you, Monsignor," she replied simply."My child, it is quite
necessary!""But I have my salvation, ever present."My dear child, do not lean upon your pretty theories in the hope that
they will open the door of heaven for you.There is no salvation
outside of the Church.""Monsignor," said Carmen gently, "such talk is very foolish.Can you
prove to me that your Church ever sent any one to heaven?Have you any
but a very mediaeval and material concept of heaven?It is the consciousness of good only, without a trace of
materiality or evil.And I enter into that consciousness by means of
the Christ-principle, which Jesus gave to the world.It is very
simple, is it not?And it makes all your pomp and ceremony, and your
penance and rites quite unnecessary."He had certain suspicions, but he was not
ready to voice them.Carmen went on:

"Monsignor, I love my fellow-men, oh, _so_ much!I want to see every
one work out his salvation, as Jesus bade us all do, and without any
hindrance from others.And I ask but that same privilege from every
one, yourself included.Let me work out my salvation as my Father has
directed.""I have no wish to hinder you, child.On
the contrary, I offer you the assistance and infallible guidance of
the Church.Beginning nineteen
centuries ago, when we were divinely appointed custodian of the
world's morals, our history has been a glorious one.We have in that
time changed a pagan world into one that fears God and follows His
Christ.""But for nineteen hundred years, Monsignor, the various so-called
Christian sects of the world have been persecuting and slaying one
another over their foolish beliefs, basing their religious theories
upon their interpretations of the Bible.Surely that is not a glorious
history!"You unwittingly argue directly for our cause, my child.The
result which you have just cited proves conclusively that the
Scriptures can not be correctly interpreted by every one.That is
perfectly patent to you, I see.Thus you acknowledge the necessity of
an infallible guide.That is to be found only in the spiritual
Fathers, and in the Pope, the holy Head of the Church of Rome, the
present Vicegerent of Christ on earth.""Then your interpretation of the Bible is the only correct one?""And you Catholics are the only true followers of Christ?"Come, Monsignor, I will get my coat and hat.he asked in amazement, as he slowly got to
his feet."Jesus said: 'He that believeth on
me, the works that I do shall he do also.'I am going to take you over
to the home of old Maggie, our cook's mother.You will
heal her, for you are a true follower of Christ.""Well--but, hasn't she a doctor?""Yes, but he can't help her.You should be able to do the works
which he did.You can change the wafer and wine into the flesh and
blood of Jesus.How much easier, then, and vastly more practical, to
cure a sick woman!Wait, I will be back in a minute.""But, you impetuous child, I shall go on no such foolish errand as
that!""If the woman were dying or dead, and you were
summoned, you would go, would you not?"And if she were dying you would put holy oil on her, and pray--but it
wouldn't make her well.And if she were dead, you would say Masses for
the repose of her soul.Monsignor, did it never occur to you that the
great works which you claim to do are all done behind the veil of
death?You can do but little for mankind here; but you pretend to do
much after they have passed beyond the grave.Is it quite fair to the
poor and ignorant, I ask, to work that way?Did it never strike you as
remarkable and very consistent that Jesus, whenever he launched a
great truth, immediately ratified it by some great sign, some sign
which the world now calls a miracle?The Gospels are full of such
instances, where he first taught, then came down and immediately
healed some one, thus at once putting his teaching to the proof.Your Church has taught and thundered and denounced
for ages, but what has it proved?You teach the so-called practical Christianity which makes a reality
of evil and an eternal necessity of hospitals and orphan asylums.If
you did his works the people would be so uplifted that these things
would be wiped out.Your Church has had nineteen hundred years in
which to learn to do the works which he did.Now come over to Maggie's
with me and prove that you are a true follower and believer, and that
the Church has given you the right sort of practical instruction!"Gradually the girl's voice waxed stronger while she delivered this
polemic.Slowly the churchman's face darkened, as he moved backward
and sank into his chair."Now, Monsignor, having scolded you well," the girl continued, smiling
as she sat down again, "I will apologize.But you needed the
scolding--you know you did!And nearly all who profess the name of
Christ need the same.Monsignor, I love you all, and every one,
whether Catholic or Protestant, or whatever his creed.But that does
not blind my eyes to your great need, and to your obstinate refusal to
make any effort to meet that need."A cynical look came into the man's face."May I ask, Miss Carmen, if
you consider yourself a true follower and believer?""Monsignor," she quickly replied, rising and facing him, "you hope by
that adroit question to confound me.Listen: when I was a child my purity of thought was such that I knew
no evil.I could not see sickness or
death as anything more than unreal shadows.And that wonderful
clearness of vision and purity of thought made me a channel for the
operation of the Christ-principle, God himself.And thereby the sick
were healed in my little home town.Then, little by little, after my
beloved teacher, Jose, came to me, I lost ground in my struggle to
keep the vision clear.They did not mean to, but he and my dearest
padre Rosendo and others held their beliefs of evil as a reality so
constantly before me that the vision became obscured, and the
spirituality alloyed.The unreal forces of evil seemed to concentrate
upon me.I know why now, for the greatest good always stirs up the
greatest amount of evil--the highest truth always has the lowest lie
as its opposite and opponent.I see now, as never before, the
unreality of evil.I see now, as never before, the marvelous truth
which Jesus tried, oh, _so_ hard, to impress upon the dull minds of
his people, the truth which you refuse to see.And ceaselessly I am
now striving to acquire 'that mind,' that spiritual consciousness,
which was in him.I have been
wonderfully shielded, led, and cared for.And I shall heal, some day,
as he did.I shall regain my former spirituality, for it has never
really been lost.But, Monsignor, do not ask me to come into your
Church and allow my brightening vision to become blurred by your very
inadequate concept of God--a God who is moved by the petitions of
Saints and Virgin and mortal men.Unless," she added,
brightening, "you will let me teach your Church what I know."You see," she
said, "your Church requires absolute submission to its age-worn
authority.According to you, I have nothing to give.Very well, if
your Church can receive nothing from me, and yet can give me nothing
more than its impossible beliefs, undemonstrable this side of the
grave, at least--then we must consider that a gulf is fixed between
us."Oh, Monsignor," she pleaded, after a moment's silence, "you see, do
you not?When Jesus said that he gave his disciples power over all
evil, did he not mean likewise over all physical action, and over
every physical condition?But did he mean that they alone should have
such power?No, he meant that every
one who followed him and strove ceaselessly for spirituality of
thought should acquire that spirituality, and thereby cleanse himself
of false beliefs, and make room for the Christ-principle to operate,
even to the healing of the sick, to the raising of those mesmerized by
the belief of death as a power and reality, and to the dematerializing
of the whole material concept of the heavens and earth.Can't you, a
churchman, see it?And can't you see how shallow your views are?Don't
you know that even the physical body is but a part of the human,
material concept, and therefore a part of the 'one lie' about God, who
is Spirit?"But now his time had come to speak in
rebuttal.And yet, he would make no attempt to assail her convictions.He knew well that she would not yield--at least, to-day."Miss Carmen," he said gently, "the Church is ever doing beneficent
deeds which do not come to light, and for which she receives no praise
from men.Hawley-Crowles's elevation to social
leadership came through her.There is also a rumor that the Church
afforded you an asylum on your first night in this city, when, if
ever, you needed aid.The Church shielded and cared for you even in
Simiti.Indeed, what has she not done for you?"Monsignor," replied Carmen, "I am not unmindful of the care always
bestowed upon me.But my gratitude is to my
God, who has worked through many channels to bless me.Leave it there, and fear not that I shall prove ungrateful
to Him, to whom my every thought is consecrated."Then he spoke low and earnestly, while he held
his gaze fixed upon the girl's bright eyes."Miss Carmen, if you knew
that the Church now afforded you the only refuge from the dangers that
threaten, you would turn to her as a frightened child to its mother.""I fear nothing, Monsignor," replied the girl, her face alight with a
smile of complete confidence."I am not the kind who may be driven by
fear into acceptance of undemonstrable, unfounded theological beliefs.Fear has always been a terrible weapon in the hands of those who have
sought to force their opinions upon their fellow-men.But it is
powerless to influence me.Indeed, according to the Bible
allegory, it began in the very garden of Eden, when poor, deceived
Adam confessed to God that he was afraid.If God was infinite then, as
you admit you believe Him to be now, who or what made Adam afraid?For, 'God hath not given us
the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.'"But, surely, Miss Carmen, you will not stubbornly close your eyes to
threatening evil?""Monsignor, I close my eyes to all that is unlike God.I know nothing but Him and His perfect manifestation."The picture which he and the
young girl formed was one of rare beauty and interest: he, weighted
with years, white of hair, but rugged of form, with strikingly
handsome features and kindly eyes--she, a child, delicate, almost
wraith-like, glowing with a beauty that was not of earth, and, though
untutored in the wiles of men, still holding at bay the sagacious
representative of a crushing weight of authority which reached far
back through the centuries, even to the Greek and Latin Fathers who
put their still unbroken seal upon the strange elaborations which they
wove out of the simple words of the Nazarene.When the churchman again looked up and felt himself engulfed in the
boundless love which emanated from that radiant, smiling girl, there
surged up within him a mighty impulse to go to her, to clasp her in
his arms, to fall at her feet and pray for even a mite of her own rare
spirituality.The purpose which he had that morning formulated died
within him; the final card which he would have thrown lay crushed in
his hand."The people believe you a child of the ancient Incas," he said slowly,
taking her hand."What if I should say that I know better?""I would say that you were right, Monsignor," she replied gently,
looking up into his face with a sweet smile."Then you admit the identity of your father?"The man bent for a moment over the little white hand, and then
immediately left the house.CHAPTER 18

Monsignor Lafelle in his interview with Carmen had thrown out a hint
of certain rumors regarding her; but the days passed, and the girl
awoke not to their significance.Then, one morning, her attention was
attracted by a newspaper report of the farewell address of a young
priest about to leave his flock.When she opened the paper and caught
sight of the news item she gave a little cry, and immediately forgot
all else in her absorption in the closing words:

  "--and I have known no other ambition since the day that little
  waif from a distant land strayed into my life, lighting the dead
  lamp of my faith with the torch of her own flaming spirituality.She said she had a message for the people up here.Would to God
  she might know that her message had borne fruit!"The newspaper slipped from the girl's hands to the floor.Her eyes,
big and shining, stared straight before her."And I will lead the
blind by a way that they know not--" she murmured.It was Miss Wall, ready now for the postponed
ride.Carmen clapped her hands and sang for joy as she summoned the
car and made her preparations."We'll go over to his church," she said
aloud.She hurried back to the newspaper to get the
address of the church from which he had spoken the preceding day."They will know where he is," she said happily."Oh, isn't it just
wonderful!"A few minutes later, with Miss Wall at her side, she was speeding to
the distant suburb where the little church was located."We are going to find a priest," she said simply."Oh, you mustn't ask
me any questions!Hawley-Crowles doesn't like to have me talk
about certain things, and so I can't tell you."But the happy, smiling countenance
disarmed suspicion."Now tell me," Carmen went on, "tell me about yourself.I'm a
missionary, you know," she added, thinking of Father Waite.Well, are you trying to convert the society world?""Yes, by Christianity--not by what the missionaries are now teaching
in the name of Christianity.I'll tell you all about it some day.Now
tell me, why are you unhappy?Why is your life pitched in such a minor
key?Perhaps, together, we can change it to a major."Miss Wall could not help joining in the merry laugh."I am unhappy," she said, "because I have arrived
nowhere."Carmen looked at her inquiringly."Well," she said, "that shows you
are on the wrong track, doesn't it?""I'm tired of life--tired of everything, everybody!"Miss Wall sank
back into the cushions with her lips pursed and her brow wrinkled."No, you are not tired of life," said Carmen quietly; "for you do not
know what life is.""No, I suppose not," replied the weary woman."Oh, don't mention that name, nor quote Scripture to me!"cried the
woman, throwing up her hands in exasperation."I've had that stuff
preached at me until it turned my stomach!I hope you are not an
emotional, weepy religionist."Padre Jose used to say--"

"Who's he?"demanded Miss Wall, somewhat curtly."Oh, he is a priest--"

"A priest!do you constantly associate with priests, and talk
religion?""Well," she responded, "I've had a good deal
to do with both.""Tell me something about your
life," she said."Surely I am a princess," returned Carmen, laughing merrily."Listen;
I will tell you about big, glorious Simiti, and the wonderful castle I
lived in there, and about my Prime Minister, Don Rosendo, and--well,
listen, and then judge for yourself if I am not of royal extraction!"Laughing again up into the mystified face of Miss Wall, the
enthusiastic girl began to tell about her former life in far-off
Guamoco.As she listened, the woman's eyes grew wide with interest.At times
she voiced her astonishment in sudden exclamations.And when the girl
concluded her brief recital, she bent upon the sparkling face a look
of mingled wonder and admiration.After going through all
that, how can you be so happy now?And with all your kin down there in
that awful war!"Don't you think I am a princess now?"Carmen asked, smiling up at
her."And--you don't want to know what it was that kept me through it all,
and that is still guiding me?"The bright, animated face looked so
eagerly, so lovingly, into the world-scarred features of her
companion."Not if you are going to talk religion.Tell me, who is this priest
you are seeking to-day, and why have you come to see him?"He is the one who found me--when I got lost--and took
me to my friends."The big car whirled around a corner and stopped before a dingy little
church edifice surmounted by a weather-beaten cross.On the steps of a
modest frame house adjoining stood a man.Carmen threw wide the door of the car and sprang out.A light came into the startled man's eyes.Then he
stepped back, that he might better see her.More than a year had
passed since he had taken her, so oddly garbed, and clinging tightly
to his hand, into the Ketchim office.And in that time, he thought,
she had been transformed into a vision of heavenly beauty.And
with that she threw her arms about him and kissed him loudly on both
cheeks.The man and Miss Wall gave vent to exclamations of astonishment.He
 violently; Miss Wall sat with mouth agape.pursued the girl, again grasping his
hands."An angel from heaven could not be more
welcome," he said.But his voice was low, and the note of sadness was
prominent."Well, I am an angel from heaven," said the laughing, artless girl.But,
whoever I am, I am, oh, so glad to see you again!I--" she looked
about carefully--"I read your sermon in the newspaper this morning."Yes, I meant you," he softly answered."Come with me now," said the eager girl."Impossible," he replied, shaking his head."Then, will you come and see me?""Why have
you never been to see me?Didn't you know I was still in the city?""I used to see your name in the papers, often.And I have followed your career with great interest.But--you moved in
a circle--from which I--well, it was hardly possible for me to come to
see you, you know--"

"It was!""But, never mind, you are coming now.Here," drawing a card from her bag, "this is the address of Madam
Beaubien.Will you come there to-morrow afternoon, at two, and talk
with me?"He looked at the card which she thrust into his hand, and then at the
richly-gowned girl before him.But he
nodded his head slowly."Tell me," she whispered, "how is Sister Katie?"Ah, if the girl could have known how that great-hearted old soul had
mourned her "little bairn" these many months."I will go to see her," said Carmen."But first you will come to me
to-morrow."She beamed upon him as she clasped his hands again.Then
she entered the car, and sat waving her hand back at him as long as he
could see her.It would be difficult to say which of the two, Miss Wall or Father
Waite, was the more startled by this abrupt and lively _rencontre_.But to Carmen, as she sat back in the car absorbed in thought, it had
been a perfectly natural meeting between two warm friends."You haven't anything but money, and
fine clothes, and automobiles, and jewels, you think.asked the wondering woman, marveling at this strange
girl who went about embracing people so promiscuously.The woman's lip trembled slightly when she heard this, but she did not
reply."And I'm going to love you," the girl continued.You're
tired of society gabble and gossip; you're tired of spending on
yourself the money you never earned; you're not a bit of use to
anybody, are you?You're a sort of tragedy, aren't
you?There are just lots of them in high society, just as
weary as you.And they lack the very
greatest thing in all of life, the very thing that no amount of money
will buy, just love!they don't realize that, in
order to get, they must give.In order to be loved, they must
themselves love.Now you start right in and love the whole world, love
everybody, big and little.And, as you love people, try to see only
their perfection.Never look at a bad trait, nor a blemish of any
sort.In a week's time you will be a new woman.""I have _always_ done it," replied Carmen."I don't know anything but
love.I never knew what it was to hate or revile.I never could see
what there was that deserved hatred or loathing.I don't see anything
but good--everywhere.""I--I don't mind your talking
that way to me," she whispered."But I just couldn't bear to listen to
any more religion."Love is the
tie that binds all together and all to God.Why, Miss Wall--"

"Call me Elizabeth, please," interrupted the woman."Well then, Elizabeth," she said softly, "all creeds have got to merge
into just one, some day, and, instead of saying 'I believe,' everybody
will say 'I understand and I love.'Why, the very person who loved
more than anybody else ever did was the one who saw God most clearly!He knew that if we would see God--good everywhere--we would just
simply _have_ to love, for God _is_ love!"Do you love me, Carmen, because you pity me?""God's children are not to be
pitied--and I see in people only His children.""Well, why, then, do you love me?"The girl replied quickly: "God is love."And now," she continued cheerily, "we are going to work together,
aren't we?And then you are
going to see just what is right for you to do--what work you are to
take up--what interests you are to have."Tell me, Carmen, why are you in society?What keeps you there, in an
atmosphere so unsuited to your spiritual life?""But--"

"Well, Elizabeth dear, every step I take is ordained by Him, who is my
life.I leave everything to Him, and then
keep myself out of the way.If He wishes to use me elsewhere, He will
remove me from society.How could this girl, who, in her
few brief years, had passed through fire and flood, still love the
hand that guided her!CHAPTER 19


To the great horde of starving European nobility the daughters of
American millionaires have dropped as heavenly manna.It was but dire
necessity that forced low the bars of social caste to the transoceanic
traffic between fortune and title.Hawley-Crowles might ever aspire to the purchase of a
decrepit dukedom had never entered her thought.A tottering earldom
was likewise beyond her purchasing power.She had contented herself
that Carmen should some day barter her rare culture, her charm, and
her unrivaled beauty, for the more lowly title of an impecunious count
or baron.But to what heights of ecstasy did her little soul rise when
the young Duke of Altern made it known to her that he would honor her
beautiful ward with his own glorious name--in exchange for La Libertad
and other good and valuable considerations, receipt of which would be
duly acknowledged."I--aw--have spoken to her, ye know, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles," that worthy
young cad announced one afternoon, as he sat alone with the successful
society leader in the warm glow of her living room.she said we were engaged, ye know--really!Said we were awfully good
friends, ye know, and all that.For Reginald had done much thinking of late--and his creditors were
restless.Hawley-Crowles,
beaming like a full-blown sunflower.Only--ye know, she'll have to be--coached a bit, ye
know--told who we are--our ancestral history, and all that.Why, she just couldn't help loving you!""No--aw--no, of course--that is--aw--she has excellent
prospects--financial, I mean, eh?Mines, and all that, ye know--eh?""Why, she owns the grandest gold mine in all South America!I--aw--I never was so attracted to a girl in all me
blooming life!You will--a--speak to her, eh?"Never fear, Reginald" she's yours.Certainly not--not when she knows about our family.And--aw--mother will talk with you--that is, about the details.She'll
arrange them, ye know.And the haughty mother of the young Duke did call shortly thereafter
to consult in regard to her son's matrimonial desires.The nerve-racking
round of balls, receptions, and other society functions was quite
forgotten by the elated Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, whose ears tingled
deliciously under the pompous boastings of the Dowager Lady Altern.Hawley-Crowles was convinced, after a
half hour's conversation with this proud mother, that the royal house
of Brunswick was but an impudent counterfeit!Reed, who had
hastily appraised it, had said that there was a mountain of gold there,
only awaiting Yankee enterprise.There was proof positive
that she was an Inca princess.Hawley-Crowles was so honored
by the deep interest which the young Duke manifested in the wonderful
girl!And she would undertake negotiations with her at once.Hawley-Crowles had to plan very carefully.She was terribly
in debt; yet she had resources.The Beaubien was inexhaustible.Ames,
too, might be depended upon.And La Libertad--well, there was Mr.Philip O. Ketchim to reckon with.So she forthwith summoned him to a
consultation.But, ere her talk with that prince of finance, another bit of good
fortune fell into the lady's spacious lap.Reed had written that he
was doing poorly with his western mining ventures, and would have to
raise money at once.He therefore offered to sell his interest in the
Simiti Company.Moreover, he wanted his wife to come to him and make
her home in California, where he doubtless would spend some years.Hawley-Crowles offered him twenty-five thousand dollars for his
Simiti interest; of which offer Reed wired his immediate acceptance.Then the lady packed her rueful sister Westward Ho!and laid her newly
acquired stock before the Beaubien for a large loan.That was but a
day before Ketchim called."Madam," said that suave gentleman, smiling piously, "you are a
genius.Our ability to announce the Duke of Altern as our largest
stockholder will result in a boom in the sales of Simiti stock.The
Lord has greatly prospered our humble endeavors.Er--might I ask,
Madam, if you would condescend to meet my wife some afternoon?We are
rapidly acquiring some standing in a financial way, and Mrs.Ketchim
would like to know you and some of the more desirable members of your
set, if it might be arranged."Hawley-Crowles beamed her joy.She drew herself up with a regnant
air.The people were coming to her, their social queen, for
recognition!"And there's my Uncle Ted, you know, Madam.He's president of the C.
and R."Hawley-Crowles nodded and looked wise."Possibly we can arrange
it," she said.What is Joplin
Zinc doing?"The lady wondered, for Joplin Zinc was not yet in operation, according
to the latest report.*       *       *       *       *

Meantime, while Mrs.Hawley-Crowles was still laying her plans to herd
the young girl into the mortgaged dukedom of Altern, Father Waite kept
his appointment, and called at the Beaubien mansion on the afternoon
Carmen had set.He was warmly received by the girl herself, who had
been watching for his coming."Now," she began like a bubbling fountain, when they were seated in
the music room, "where's Jude?Why, I haven't the slightest idea to whom you refer," returned
the puzzled man."The woman who took me to the Sister Superior," explained Carmen."Well," said the girl confidently, "I saw her, but she got away from
me.But I shall find her--it is right that I should.Now tell me, what
are you going to do?"Earn my living some way," he replied meditatively."You have lots of friends who will help you?""I am an apostate, you know.""Well, that means that you're free.The chains have dropped, haven't
they?""You are not dazed, nor confused!Why, you're like a prisoner coming
out of his dungeon into the bright sunlight.You're only blinking,
that's all.And, as for confusion--well, if I would admit it to be
true I could point to a terrible state of it!Just think, a duke wants
to marry me; Mrs.Hawley-Crowles is determined that he shall; I am an
Inca princess, and yet I don't know who I am; my own people apparently
are swallowed up by the war in Colombia; and I am in an environment
here in New York in which I have to fight every moment to keep myself
from flying all to pieces!But I guess God intends to keep me here for
the present.Oh, yes, and Monsignor Lafelle insists that I am a
Catholic and that I must join his Church.""Is Monsignor Lafelle working with
Madam Beaubien, your friend?"Hawley-Crowles--"

"Was it through him that she became a communicant?"Ames's sister, the Dowager Duchess, in England.The young Duke is also
going to join the faith, I learn.He stopped suddenly and
looked searchingly at her.At that moment a maid entered, bearing a card.Close on her heels
followed the subject of their conversation, Monsignor himself.As he entered, Carmen rose hastily to greet him.Then, as he straightened up, his glance fell upon Father Waite.For a moment the two men stood
eying each other sharply.Then Lafelle looked from Father Waite to
Carmen quizzically."I beg your pardon," he said, "I was not aware
that you had a caller.Madam Beaubien, is she at home?"murmured Lafelle, looking significantly from the girl to Father
Waite, while a smile curled his lips.He bowed again, and turned toward the exit.She had caught the
churchman's insinuating glance and instantly read its meaning."Monsignor Lafelle, you will remain!"The churchman's brows arched with surprise, but he came back and stood
by the chair which she indicated."And first," went on the girl, standing before him like an incarnate
Nemesis, her face flushed and her eyes snapping, "you will hear from
me a quotation from the Scripture, on which you assume to be
authority: 'As a man thinketh in his heart, so _is_ he!'"Finally a bland
smile spread over his features, and he sat down."Now, Monsignor Lafelle," she continued severely, "you have urged me
to unite with your Church.When you asked me to subscribe to your
beliefs I looked first at them, and then at you, their product.You
have come here this afternoon to plead with me again.The thoughts
which you accepted when you saw Father Waite here alone with me, are
they a reflection of love, which thinketh no evil?Or do they reflect
the intolerance, the bigotry, the hatred of the carnal mind?You told
me that your Church would not let me teach it.Think you I will let it
or you teach me?"Father Waite sat amazed at the girl's stinging rebuke.When she
concluded he rose to go.You have left the Church
of which Monsignor Lafelle is a part.Either you have done that
Church, and him, a great injustice--or he does ignorant or wilful
wrong in insisting that I unite with it.""My dear child," said Lafelle gently, now recovered and wholly on his
guard, "your impetuosity gets the better of your judgment.This is no
occasion for a theological discussion, nor are you sufficiently
informed to bear a part in such.As for myself, you unintentionally do
me great wrong.As I have repeatedly told you, I seek only your
eternal welfare.Else would I not labor with you as I do.""Is my eternal welfare dependent upon
acceptance of the Church's doctrines?""No," he said, in a scarcely audible voice.A cynical look came into Lafelle's eyes.But he replied affably: "When
preachers fall out, the devil falls in.Waite, comes
quite consistently from one who has impudently tossed aside
authority.""My authority, Monsignor," returned the ex-priest in a low tone, "is
Jesus Christ, who said: 'Love thy neighbor as thyself.'"murmured Lafelle; "then it was love that prompted you to abandon
your little flock?""I left my pulpit, Monsignor, because I had nothing to give my people.I no longer believe the dogmas of the Church.And I refused longer to
take the poor people's money to support an institution so politically
religious as I believe your Church to be.I could no longer take their
money to purchase the release of their loved ones from an imagined
purgatory--a place for which there is not the slightest Scriptural
warrant--"

"You mistake, sir!""Very well, Monsignor," replied Father Waite; "grant, then, that there
is such Scriptural warrant; I would nevertheless know that the
existence of purgatory was wholly incompatible with the reign of an
infinite God of love.And, knowing that, I have ceased to extort gifts
of money from the ignorance of the living and the ghastly terrors of
the dying--"

"And so deceive yourself that you are doing a righteous act in
removing their greatest consolation," the churchman again interrupted,
a sneer curving his lip.The consolation which the stupifying drug affords, yes!Ah, Monsignor, as I looked down into the faces of my poor people, week
after week, I knew that no sacerdotal intervention was needed to remit
their sins, for their sins were but their unsolved problems of life.Oh, the poor, grief-stricken mothers who bent their tear-stained eyes
upon me as I preached the 'authority' of the Fathers!Well I knew
that, when I told them from my pulpit that their deceased infants, if
baptized, went straight to heaven, they blindly, madly accepted my
words!And when I went further and told them that their dead babes had
joined the ranks of the blessed, and could thenceforth be prayed to,
could I wonder that they rejoiced and eagerly grasped the false
message of cheer?They believed because they wanted it to be so.And
yet those utterances of mine, based upon the accepted doctrine of
Holy Church, were but narcotics, lulling those poor, afflicted minds
into a false sense of rest and security, and checking all further
human progress.""It is to be regretted," he said
coldly, "that such narrowness of view should be permitted to impede
the salvation of souls.""Ah, how many souls
have I not saved!--and yet I know not whether they or I be really
saved!From misery,
disease, suffering in this life?Ah, my friend, saved only from the torments of a hell and a purgatory
constructed in the fertile minds of busy theologians!""Some other day, perhaps--when it may be
more convenient for us both--and you are alone--"

Carmen laughed."Don't quit the field, Monsignor--unless you surrender
abjectly.And you were quite
indiscreet, if you will recall.""You write my faults in brass," he gently
lamented."When you publish my virtues, if you find that I am
possessed of any, I fear you will write them in water.""Your virtues should advertise themselves,
Monsignor.""Ah, then do you not see in me the virtue of desiring your welfare
above all else, my child?""And the welfare of this great country, which you have come here to
assist in making dominantly Catholic, is it not so, Monsignor?"Then he smiled genially back at the girl."It is an ambition which I am not ashamed to own," he returned
gently."But, Monsignor," Carmen continued earnestly, "are you not aware of
the inevitable failure of your mission?Do you not know that mediaeval
theology comports not with modern progress?""True, my child," replied the churchman."And more, that our
so-called modern progress--modernism, free-thinking, liberty of
conscience, and the consequent terrible extravagance of beliefs and
false creeds--constitutes the greatest menace now confronting this
fair land."Monsignor," said Carmen, "in the Middle Ages the Church was supreme.Emperors and kings bowed in submission before her.Would you be willing, for the sake of Church
supremacy to-day, to return to the state of society and civilization
then obtaining?"I point you to Mexico, Cuba, the Philippines, South America, all
Catholic now or formerly, and I ask if you attribute not their
oppression, their ignorance, their low morals and stunted manhood, to
the dominance of churchly doctrines, which oppose freedom of
conscience and press and speech, and make learning the privilege of
the clergy and the rich?""It is an old argument, child," deprecated Lafelle."May I not point
to France, on the contrary?""She has all but driven the Church from her borders.""And England, though Anglican,
calls herself Catholic.Germany is
forsaking Luther, as she sees the old light shining still undimmed."The latter read in her glance an
invitation further to voice his own convictions."Monsignor doubtless misreads the signs of the times," he said slowly."The hour has struck for the ancient and materialistic theories
enunciated with such assumption of authority by ignorant, often
blindly bigoted theologians, to be laid aside.The religion of our
fathers, which is our present-day evangelical theology, was derived
from the traditions of the early churchmen.They put their seal upon
it; and we blindly accept it as authority, despite the glaring,
irrefutable fact that it is utterly undemonstrable.Why do the people
continue to be deceived by it?only because of its mesmeric
promise of immortality beyond the grave."Monsignor bowed stiffly in the direction of Father Waite."Fortunately,
your willingness to plunge the Christian world into chaos will fail of
concrete results," he said coldly."I but voice the sentiments of millions, Monsignor.For them, too, the
time has come to put by forever the paraphernalia of images, candles,
and all the trinkets used in the pagan ceremonial which has so
quenched our spirituality, and to seek the undivided garment of the
Christ.""The world to-day, Monsignor, stands at the door of a new era, an era
which promises a grander concept of God and religion, the tie which
binds all to Him, than has ever before been known.And we are at
last beginning to work with true scientific precision and system.As
in chemistry, mathematics, and the physical sciences, so in matters
religious, we are beginning to _prove_ our working hypotheses.And so
a new spiritual enlightenment is come.People are awaking to a dim
perception of the meaning of spiritual life, as exemplified in Jesus
Christ.And they are vaguely beginning to see that it is possible to
every one.The abandonment of superstition, religious and other, has
resulted in such a sudden expansion of the human mind that the most
marvelous material progress the world has ever witnessed has come
swiftly upon us, and we live more intensely in a single hour to-day
than our fathers lived in weeks before us.Oh, yes, we are already
growing tired of materiality.But, Monsignor, let not the Church boast itself that the
acceptance of her mediaeval dogmas will meet the world's great need.That need will be met, I think, only as we more and more clearly
perceive the tremendous import of the mission of Jesus, and learn how
to grasp and apply the marvelous Christ-principle which he used and
told us we should likewise employ to work out our salvation."During Father Waite's earnest talk Lafelle sat with his eyes fixed
upon Carmen.When the ex-priest concluded, the churchman ignored him
and vouchsafed no reply.said the girl, after waiting some moments in
expectation.Then, nodding his shapely head, he said in
a pleading tone:

"Have I no champion here?Would you, too, suddenly abolish the Church,
Catholic and Protestant alike?Why, my dear child, with your
ideals--which no one appreciates more highly than I--do you continue
to persecute me so cruelly?Can not you, too, sense the unsoundness of
the views just now so eloquently voiced?"You speak wholly without authority or proof,
as is your wont.""Well," he said, "there are several hundred
million Catholics and Protestants in the world to-day.Would you
presume to say that they are all mistaken, and that you are right?Indeed, I think you set the
Church an example in that respect.""Monsignor, there were once several hundred millions who believed that
the earth was flat, and that the sun revolved about it.But the--"

"And, Monsignor, there are billions to-day who believe that matter is
a solid, substantial reality, and that it possesses life and
sensation.There are billions who believe that the physical eyes see,
and the ears hear, and the hands feel.Yet these beliefs are all
capable of scientific refutation."I am not unacquainted with philosophical speculation," he returned
suggestively."This is not mere speculation, Monsignor," put in Father Waite."The
beliefs of the human mind are its fetish.Such beliefs become in time
national customs, and men defend them with frenzy, utterly wrong and
undemonstrable though they be.Then they remain as the incubus of true
progress.By them understanding becomes degraded, and the human mind
narrows and shrinks.And the mind that clings to them will then
mercilessly hunt out the dissenting minds of its heretical neighbors
and stone them to death for disagreeing.So now, you would stone me
for obeying Christ's command to take up my bed on the Sabbath day.""Still you blazon my faults," he said in
a tone of mock sadness, and addressing Carmen."But, like the Church
which you persecute, I shall endure.We have been martyred throughout
the ages.Our wayward children forsake us,"
nodding toward Father Waite, "and yet we welcome their return when
they have tired of the husks.The press teems with slander against us;
we are reviled from east to west.But our reply is that such slander
and untruth can best be met by our leading individual lives of such an
exemplary nature as to cause all men to be attracted by our holy
light.""I agree with you, Monsignor," quickly replied Carmen."Scurrilous
attacks upon the Church but make it a martyr.Vilification returns
upon the one who hurls the abuse.One can not fling mud without
soiling one's hands.I oppose not men, but human systems of thought.Whatever is good will stand, and needs no defense.And there is no excuse, for salvation is at hand.""_Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts_,"
she replied earnestly."_To him that soweth righteousness_--right
thinking--_shall be a sure reward_.Ah, Monsignor, do you at heart
believe that the religion of the Christ depends upon doctrines, signs,
dogmas?But signs and proofs naturally and inevitably
follow the right understanding of Jesus' teachings, even according to
these words: _These signs shall follow them that believe_.Paul gave the
formula for salvation, when he said: _But we all with open face beholding
as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image
from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord_.Can you see that, taking Jesus as our model and
following his every command--seeing Him only, the Christ-principle, which
is God, good, without any admixture of evil--we change, even though
slowly, from glory to glory, step by step, until we rise out of all
sense of evil and death?And this is done by the Spirit which is God.""Yes," said Father Waite, taking up the conversation when she paused."Even the poorest human being can understand that.Why, then, the
fungus growth of traditions, ceremonies, rites and forms which have
sprung up about the Master's simple words?Why the wretched
formalistic worship throughout the world?Why the Church's frigid,
lifeless traditions, so inconsistent with the enlarging sense of God
which marks this latest century?The Church has yet to prove its
utility, its right to exist and to pose as the religious teacher of
mankind.Else must it fall beneath the axe which is even now at the
root of the barren tree of theology.Her theology, like the Judaism of
the Master's day, has no prophets, no poets, no singers.And her
priests, as in his time, have sunk into a fanatical observance of
ritual and form.""And yet," observed Carmen, "you still urge me to unite with it."Moreover, it irked him sore to be made a
target for the unassailable logic of the apostate Waite.Then, too,
the appearance of the ex-priest there that afternoon in company with
this girl who held such radical views regarding religious matters
portended in his thought the possibility of a united assault upon the
foundations of his cherished system.She
nettled and exasperated him.Did he
have the power to silence her?he asked, with a show of gaiety."Yes," replied Carmen, "you may go now."He, Monsignor, a dignitary of
Holy Church?He turned upon the girl and her
companion, furious with anger."I have been very patient with you both," he said in a voice that he
could not control.Abuse the Church
as you will, the fact remains that the world fears her and trembles
before her awful voice!Because the world recognizes her mighty
power, a power of unified millions of human beings and exhaustless
wealth.She is the leader, the guide, the teacher, the supreme object
of worship of a countless army who would lay down their lives to-day
for her.Her subjects gather from every quarter of the globe.They are
English, French, German, American--_but they are Catholics first_!Emperor, King, Ruler, or Government--all are alike subject to her
supreme, divine authority!Nationalities, customs, family ties--all
melt away before her, to whom her followers bow in loyal consecration.The power which her supreme leader and head wields is all but
omnipotent!He is by divine decree Lord of the world.Hundreds of
millions bend before his throne and offer him their hearts and swords!I say, you have good reason to quake!The onward march of Holy Church is not disturbed by the croaking
calumnies of such as you who would assault her!And to you I say,
beware!"His face was purple, as he stopped and mopped his damp brow."What we have to beware of, Monsignor," said Father Waite gravely, "is
the steady encroachments of Rome in this country, with her weapons of
fear, ignorance, and intolerance--"

"Intolerance!Why, in this country, whose
Constitution provided toleration for every form of religion--"

Carmen had risen and gone to the man."Monsignor," she said, "the
founders of the American nation did provide for religious tolerance--and
they were wise according to their light.But we of this day are
still wiser, for we have some knowledge of the wonderful working of
mental laws.I, too, believe in toleration of opinion.You are
welcome to yours, and I to mine.But--and here is the great point--the
opinion which Holy Church has held throughout the ages regarding those
who do not accept her dogmas is that they are damned, that they are
outcasts of heaven, that they merit the stake and rack.The Church's
hatred of heretics has been deadly.Her thought concerning them has
not been that of love, such as Jesus sent out to all who did not
agree with him, but deadly, suggestive hatred.Now our Constitution
does not provide for tolerance of hate and murder-thoughts, which enter
the minds of the unsuspecting and work destruction there in the form
of disease, disaster, and death.That is what we object to in you,
Monsignor.And toward such thoughts we have a right to be very intolerant, even to
the point of destroying them in human mentalities.Again I say, I war
not against people, but against the murderous carnal thought of the
human mind!"Monsignor had fallen back before the girl's strong words.His face
had grown black, and his hands were working convulsively."Monsignor," continued Carmen in a low, steady voice, "you have
threatened me with something which you apparently hold over me.You
are very like the people of Galilee: if you can not refute by reason,
you would circumvent by law, by the Constitution, by Congress.Instead of threatening us with the flames
of hell for not being good, why do you not show us by the great
example of Jesus' love how to be so?Are you manifesting love now--or
the carnal mind?I judge your Church by such as manifest it to me.How, then, shall I judge it by you to-day?"He rose slowly and took her by the hand."I beg your pardon," he said
in a strange, unnatural voice.And I assure you that you quite
misunderstand me, and the Church which I represent."Surely, Monsignor," returned the girl heartily."A debate such as
this is stimulating, don't you think so?""Ah, Monsignor," she said lightly, as she stepped into the room.Why have you avoided me since your return to America?""Madam," replied Lafelle, in some confusion, "no one regrets more than
I the press of business which necessitated it.But your little friend
has told me I may return.""Always welcome, Monsignor," replied the Beaubien, scanning him
narrowly as she accompanied him to the door."By the way, you forgot
our little compact, did you not?""Madam, I came out of a sense of duty.""Of that I have no doubt, Monsignor.Daniel went back to the bedroom.She returned again to the music room, where Carmen made her acquainted
with Father Waite, and related the conversation with Lafelle.While
the girl talked the Beaubien's expression grew serious.Then Carmen
launched into her association with the ex-priest, concluding with:
"And he must have something to do, right away, to earn his living!"She always did when Carmen, no matter how
serious the conversation, infused her sparkling animation into it."That isn't nearly as important as to know what he thinks about
Monsignor's errand here this afternoon, dearie," she said."Madam," he said with great seriousness, "I would
be very wide awake."The Beaubien studied him for a moment."I think--I think--" He hesitated, and looked at Carmen."I think he--has been greatly angered by--this girl--and by my
presence here."Then abruptly: "What are you going to do
now?""I have funds enough to keep me some weeks, Madam, while making plans
for the future.""Then remain where I can keep in touch with you."For the Beaubien had just returned from a two hours' ride with J.
Wilton Ames, and she felt that she needed a friend.CHAPTER 20


The Beaubien sat in the rounded window of the breakfast room.Carmen
nestled at her feet.The maid had just removed the remains of the
light luncheon."Dearest, please, _please_ don't look so serious!"The Beaubien twined her fingers through the girl's flowing locks."I
will try, girlie," she said, though her voice broke.Carmen looked up into her face with a wistful yearning."Ever since Monsignor Lafelle and Father Waite
were here you have been so quiet; and that was nearly a week ago.I
know I can help, if you will only let me.""By knowing that God is everywhere, and that evil is unreal and
powerless," came the quick, invariable reply.Why, if I were chained to a stake, with fire all around me, I'd
know it wasn't true!""I think you are chained--and the fire has been kindled," said the
woman in a voice that fell to a whisper."Then your thought is wrong--all wrong!And wrong thought just _can't_
be externalized to me, for I know that 'There shall no mischief happen
to the righteous,' that is, to the right-thinking.The Beaubien got up and walked slowly around
the room, as if to summon her strength."I'm going to tell you," she said firmly."You are right, and I have
been wrong.I--I
have lost a great deal of money."I have discovered in the past few months that there are better
things in life.But--" her lips tightened, and her eyes half
closed--"he can _not_ have you!"Listen, child: I know not why it is, but you awaken something in
every life into which you come.The woman I was a year ago and the
woman I am to-day meet almost as strangers now.The only answer I
can give is, you.I don't know what you did to people in South
America; I can only surmise.Yet of this I am certain, wherever you
went you made a path of light.But the effect you have on people
differs with differing natures.Just why this is, I do not know.It
must have something to do with those mental laws of which I am so
ignorant, and of which you know so much."Carmen looked at her in wondering anticipation.The Beaubien smiled
down into the face upturned so lovingly, and went on:

"From what you have told me about your priest, Jose, I know that you
were the light of his life.He loved you to the complete obliteration
of every other interest.You have not said so; but I know it.How,
indeed, could it be otherwise?On the other hand, that heartless
Diego--his mad desire to get possession of you was only animal.Why
should you, a child of heaven, arouse such opposite sentiments?""Dearest," said the girl, laying her head on the woman's knees, "that
isn't what's worrying you.""No--but I think of it so often.And, as for me, you have turned me
inside-out.""Well, I think this side wears better,
don't you?""It is softer--it may not," returned the woman gently."But I have no
desire to change back."Ames
and I have been--no, not friends.I had no higher ideals than he, and
I played his game with him.And at a time when he had
involved me heavily financially.The Colombian revolution--his cotton
deal--he must have foreseen, he is so uncanny--he must have known that
to involve me meant control whenever he might need me!He needs me
now, for I stand between him and you.""God stands between me and every
form of evil!"She sat down on the arm of the Beaubien's chair."Is it
because you will not let him have me that he threatens to ruin you
financially?"He couldn't ruin me in reputation, for--" her voice again faded
to a whisper, "I haven't any."cried the girl, throwing her arms about the
woman's neck."Your true self is just coming to light!The Beaubien suddenly burst into a flood of tears.The strain of weeks
was at last manifesting."Oh, I have been in the gutter!--he dragged
me through the mire!--and I let him!I schemed and plotted with him; I ruined and pillaged
with him; I murdered reputations and blasted lives with him, that I
might get money, dirty, blood-stained money!Oh, Carmen, I didn't know
what I was doing, until you came!And now I'd hang on the cross if I
could undo it!And he has you and me in his
clutches, and he is crushing us!"She bent her head and sobbed
violently."Be still, and _know_ that I am
God."The Beaubien raised her head and smiled feebly through her
tears."He governs all, dearest," whispered Carmen, as she drew the woman's
head to her breast.cried the Beaubien, starting up.No, we will stay and meet them, right here!"The Beaubien's hand shook as she clasped Carmen's."I can't turn to
Kane, nor to Fitch, nor Weston.I've
ruined Gannette myself--for him!Hawley-Crowles--"

"Mrs.sobbed the suffering woman, clinging to the girl."I lent her money--took her notes--which I sold again to Mr."Well, you can buy them back, can't you?"Most that I have is mortgaged to him on the investments I made at his
direction," wailed the woman."I will try--I am trying, desperately!But--there is Monsignor Lafelle!"And I'm sure he holds something over
you and me.But, I will send for him--I will renew my vows to his
Church--anything to--"

"Listen, dearest," interrupted Carmen.If I am the cause of it all, I can--"

"You will not!"The desperate woman put her head in the girl's lap and sobbed
bitterly."There is a way out, dearest," whispered Carmen."I _know_ there is,
no matter what seems to be or to happen, for 'underneath are the
everlasting arms.'Hawley-Crowles told me this
morning that Mrs.Ames intends to give a big reception next week.And--it will be right, I
know."And Carmen sat with the repentant woman all that day, struggling with
her to close the door upon her sordid past, and to open it wide to
"that which is to come."*       *       *       *       *

The days following were busy ones for many with whom our story is
concerned.Every morning saw Carmen on her way to the Beaubien, to
comfort and advise.Every afternoon found her yielding gently to the
relentless demands of society, or to the tiresome calls of her
thoroughly ardent wooer, the young Duke of Altern.Carmen would have
helped him if she could.But she found so little upon which to build.And she bore with him largely on account of Mrs.Hawley-Crowles, for
whom she and the Beaubien were now daily laboring.The young man
tacitly assumed proprietorship over the girl, and all society was agog
with expectation of the public announcement of their engagement.Hawley-Crowles still came and went upon a tide of unruffled joy.The cornucopia of Fortune lay full at her feet.Her broker, Ketchim,
basked in the sunlight of her golden smiles--and quietly sold his own
Simiti stock on the strength of her patronage.Society fawned and
smirked at her approach, and envied her brilliant success, as it
copied the cut of her elaborate gowns--all but the deposed Mrs.Ames
and her unlovely daughter, who sulked and hated, until they received a
call from Monsignor Lafelle.This was shortly after that gentleman's
meeting with Carmen and Father Waite in the Beaubien mansion.And he
left the Ames home with an ominous look on his face."The girl is a
menace," he muttered, "and she deserves her fate."The Ames grand reception, promising to be the most brilliant event of
the year, barring the famous _Bal de l'Opera_, was set for Thursday.Hawley-Crowles nor Carmen had received invitations.To the former it was evident that there was some mistake."For it
can't be possible that the hussy doesn't intend to invite us!"Hawley-Crowles
drenched with tears of anxiety and vexation."I'd call her up and ask,
if I dared," she groaned.And, to the
amazement of the exclusive set, the brilliant function was held
without the presence of its acknowledged leaders, Mrs.Hawley-Crowles
and her ward, the Inca princess.*       *       *       *       *

On Wednesday night Harris arrived from Denver.His arrival was
instantly made known to J. Wilton Ames, who, on the morning following,
summoned both him and Philip O. Ketchim to his private office.There
were present, also, Monsignor Lafelle and Alonzo Hood.The latter was observed to change color as he
timidly entered the room and faced the waiting audience."Be seated, gentlemen," said Ames genially, after cordially shaking
hands with them and introducing the churchman.Then, turning to
Harris, "You are on your way to Colombia, I learn.Going down to
inaugurate work on the Simiti holdings, I suppose?"Harris threw a quick glance at Ketchim.The latter sat blank,
wondering if there were any portions of the earth to which Ames's long
arms did not reach."As a matter of fact," Ames continued, leaning back in his chair and
pressing the tips of his fingers together before him, "a hitch seems
to have developed in Simiti proceedings.Ketchim," turning suddenly and sharply upon that gentleman, "because
my brokers have picked up for me several thousand shares of the
stock.""But," proceeded Ames calmly, "now that I have put money into it, I
learn that the Simiti Company has no property whatever in Colombia."A haze slowly gathered before Ketchim's eyes."How do you make that out, Mr.he
heard Harris say in a voice that seemed to come from an infinite
distance."I myself saw the title papers which old Rosendo had, and
saw them transferred to Mr.Moreover,
I personally visited the mine in question."The
property was relocated by this Rosendo, and he secured title to it
under the name of the Chicago mine.It was that name which deceived
the clerks in the Department of Mines in Cartagena, and caused them to
issue title, not knowing that it really was the famous old La
Libertad.""Well, I don't see that there is any ground for confusion.""Simply this," returned Ames evenly: "La Libertad mine, since the
death of its former owner, Don Ignacio de Rincon, has belonged to the
Church.""By what right does it belong to the
Church?""By the ancient law of _'en manos muertas'_, my friend," replied Ames,
unperturbed."Our friend, Monsignor Lafelle, representing the Church, will
explain," said Ames, waving a hand toward that gentleman."I deeply regret this unfortunate
situation, gentlemen," he began.Ames has pointed out,
the confusion came about through issuing title to the mine under the
name Chicago.Don Ignacio de Rincon, long before his departure from
Colombia after the War of Independence, drew up his last will, and,
following the established custom among wealthy South Americans of that
day, bequeathed this mine, La Libertad, and other property, to the
Church, invoking the old law of _'en manos muertas'_ which, being
translated, means, 'in dead hands.'Pious Catholics of many lands have
done the same throughout the centuries.Such a bequest places property
in the custody of the Church; and it may never be sold or disposed of
in any way, but all revenue from it must be devoted to the purchase of
Masses for the souls in purgatory.It was through the merest chance, I
assure you, that your mistake was brought to light.Ames, had purchased stock in your company, I took the
pains to investigate while in Cartagena recently, and made the
discovery which unfortunately renders your claim to the mine quite
null."turning savagely
upon the paralyzed Ketchim."That," interposed Ames with cruel significance, "is a matter which he
will explain in court."Fleeting visions of the large blocks of stock which he had sold; of
the widows, orphans, and indigent clergymen whom he had involved; of
the notes which the banks held against him; of his questionable deals
with Mrs.Hawley-Crowles; and of the promiscuous peddling of his own
holdings in the now ruined company, rushed over the clouded mind of
this young genius of high finance.His tongue froze, though his
trembling body dripped with perspiration.Somehow he found the door, and groped his way to a descending
elevator.And somehow he lived through that terror-haunted day and
night.But very early next morning, while his blurred eyes were drinking in
the startling report of the Simiti Company's collapse, as set forth in
the newspaper which he clutched in his shaking hand, the maid led in a
soft-stepping gentleman, who laid a hand upon his quaking shoulder and
read to him from a familiar-looking document an irresistible
invitation to take up lodgings in the city jail.*       *       *       *       *

There were other events forward at the same time, which came to light
that fateful next day.Hawley-Crowles, after a
night of mingled worry and anger over the deliberate or unintentional
exclusion of herself and Carmen from the Ames reception the preceding
night, descended to her combined breakfast and luncheon.At her plate
lay the morning mail, including a letter from France.She tore it
open, hastily scanned it, then dropped with a gasp into her chair."Father--married to--a French--adventuress!The long-cherished hope of a speedy inheritance of his snug fortune
lay blasted at her feet.The telephone bell rang sharply, and she rose dully to answer it.The
call came from the city editor of one of the great dailies."It is
reported," said the voice, "that your ward, Miss Carmen Ariza, is the
illegitimate daughter of a <DW64> priest, now in South America.We
would like your denial, for we learn that it was for this reason that
you and the young lady were not included among the guests at the Ames
reception last evening."Hawley-Crowles's legs tottered under her, as she blindly wandered
from the telephone without replying.Carmen--the daughter of a priest!Her father a <DW64>--her mother, what?The stunned woman mechanically took up the morning paper which lay on
the table.Her glance was at once attracted to the great headlines
announcing the complete exposure of the Simiti bubble.Her eyes nearly
burst from her head as she grasped its fatal meaning to her.With a
low, inarticulate sound issuing from her throat, she turned and groped
her way back to her boudoir.*       *       *       *       *

Meanwhile, the automobile in which Carmen was speeding to the
Beaubien mansion was approached by a bright, smiling young woman, as
it halted for a moment at a street corner.Carmen recognized her as
a reporter for one of the evening papers, who had called often at the
Hawley-Crowles mansion that season for society items."I was on my way
to see you.Our office received a report this morning from some source
that your father--you know, there has been some mystery about your
parentage--that he was really a priest, of South America.His
name--let me think--what did they say it was?"The problem
of her descent had really become a source of amusement to her."It began with a D, if I am not mistaken.I'm not up on Spanish
names," the young woman returned pleasantly."Well, I'm sure I can't say."But--you think it was, don't you?""Well, I don't believe it was Padre Diego--he wasn't a good man."I was in his house, in Banco.He used to insist that I
was his child."By the way, you knew a woman named Jude, didn't you?But she took you out of a house down on--"

"Yes.And I've tried to find her ever since.""You know Father Waite, too, the ex-priest?""You and he going to work together, I suppose?""Why, I'm sure I don't know.You think this Diego might
have been your father?That is, you can't say positively that he
wasn't?"You can come up to the
house and talk about South America, if you want to."She nodded pleasantly, and the car moved away.The innocent, ingenuous
girl was soon to learn what modern news-gathering and dissemination
means in this great Republic.But she rode on, happy in the thought
that she and the Beaubien were formulating plans to save Mrs."We'll arrange it somehow," said the Beaubien, looking up from her
papers when Carmen entered."Go, dearie, and play the organ while I
finish this.Then I will return home with you to have a talk with Mrs.For hours the happy girl lingered at the beloved organ.The Beaubien
at her desk below stopped often to listen.And often she would hastily
brush away the tears, and plunge again into her papers."I suppose I
should have told Mrs.Hawley-Crowles," she said."But I couldn't give
her any hope.And yet," she reflected
sadly, "who would believe _me_?"The morning papers lay still unread
upon her table.Late in the afternoon the Beaubien with Carmen entered her car and
directed the chauffeur to drive to the Hawley-Crowles home.As they
entered a main thoroughfare they heard the newsboys excitedly crying
extras.Of a sudden a vague, unformed presentiment of impending evil came to
the girl.She half rose, and clutched the Beaubien's hand.Then there
flitted through her mind like a beam of light the words of the
psalmist: "A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy
right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee."She sank back against
the Beaubien's shoulder and closed her eyes.Presently the chauffeur turned and said something
through the speaking tube.cried the Beaubien, springing from the seat.A loud cry escaped her as she took the sheet and glanced at the
startling headlines.James Hawley-Crowles, financially ruined,
and hurled to disgrace from the pinnacle of social leadership by the
awful exposure of the parentage of her ward, had been found in her
bedroom, dead, with a revolver clasped in her cold hand.CARMEN ARIZA

CHAPTER 1


The chill winds of another autumn swirled through the masonry-lined
canons of the metropolis and sighed among the stark trees of its
deserted parks.They caught up the tinted leaves that dropped from
quivering branches and tossed them high, as Fate wantons with human
hopes before she blows her icy breath upon them.They shrieked among
the naked spars of the _Cossack_, drifting with her restless master
far out upon the white-capped waves.They moaned in low-toned agony
